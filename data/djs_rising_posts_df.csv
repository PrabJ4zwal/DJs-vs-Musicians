1,Very old mixer with old light output. Help please!,3,1cew75x,DJs,https://i.redd.it/zuztovnox4xc1.jpeg,12,"I’ve switched out my old DJM-500 (broken) for a TASCAM X-15. Because of the age (released 2002) and lack of relevance for TASCAM products in today’s world I’m wondering if anyone knows what type of output this light is for? Anywhere online leads me back to the same user manuals that don’t indicate what type of connection it uses, all I’ve found is that it has a maximum 5W output.

2,First time using Algoriddim’s DJay Pro at a gig. I’m impressed.,76,1ce8lr8,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1ce8lr8/first_time_using_algoriddims_djay_pro_at_a_gig_im/,59,"So I forgot my laptop at home for one of my residencies tonight. I could have gone home to grab it, but decided to give dj pro a try cause I had all the required adaptors, and had a decent collection of music still on my iPhone 12 Pro Max. I was djing off a Rane 72 and a single Rane Twelve and it was pretty flawless.


Plus there’s tidal support, which btw, I haven’t updated to the dj plan yet and it still worked - with stems and everything.

Low key restaurant gig so no real pressure but I did play for 4.5 hour. I haven’t used the program since like 2020

And holy shit did this program perform! 

I’m a serato dj through and through - and have been using the software since 2007 and I figured it out pretty quickly despite not using it in 4 years.

There a couple key features that I miss from Serato, and a few performance/design/mapping issues that bugged me, but i was really impressed by the overall experience.

I definitely enjoyed it more than playing o cdjs and even the denon gear.

I’ve been hoping a dvs standalone solution that I thought would be in the form of a mixer with usb support, but I think djay pro is going to be the equivalent of usbs and cdjs for turntable/dvs djs.

Bring a phone, cables, headphones, and adapter if needed and you’re golden…",1714202519.0
3,The zoom H4 essential is a great device for recording your mixes,2,1cet0ja,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1cet0ja/the_zoom_h4_essential_is_a_great_device_for/,1,"I just wanted to come on here and share my experience because I've seen a lot of posts on here asking how to record mixes and use a recorder but having issues with the recordings clipping. 

I have a xone 96 which has a record out option via rca so I initially started with the zoom h1 essentials. Turns out the 3.5mm mic line in isn't built to handle the level of audio you get from a mixer unless you use an attenuator, which I did end up getting one but I had to babysit the levels on the mixer and keep them at around 0db otherwise it would still clip or get fairly close so I ended up returning it and getting the zoom h4 essential.

This thing has been so great. It has 1/4 line input which is built to handle audio from the mixer. I just plug it from the record out on my mixer directly to the h4e with an rca to dual 1/4 input, hit record and play my set as normal. Don't have to worry about setting levels on the device and can push the gain to the upper levels on the mixer without the recording clipping.

This thing is so convenient, no more lugging my laptop around to record sets, just plug n play. Audio is great, I should have went with this one in the first place.",1714262951.0

One of the things you get to learn obviously is how people get themselves on the bill. And we’re talking here just your good local venues not big warehouse project nights or touring events.

Everyone gets in different ways. Very common to see people running events who put the same three mates on everytime, I get it. Another is maybe the venue owner puts their friends on every weekend, not many else get a look in. I get that. And then the rest of us are left to just put ourselves out there in hopes or  through becoming known slowly you get an opportunity to showcase your stuff at event once in a while. 

One I don’t understand is how sometimes there’s like that one guy who’s on every single event poster. Like every single one. I know loads of good DJs who aren’t getting this much play time in the local scene. Like are they just impeccably good at networking like what’s going on that everyone wants them on their thing? My brain isn’t computing what’s happening there? Or are they just good? I still feel a bit naive at times about how some things can work so not sure if theres something else to it that I’m not grasping or it’s just simply good DJing. 

Any one seen people get gigs for ridiculous reasons? I’m intrigued to know if there’s things I’m naive too ",1714177112.0

Now don’t get me wrong, the E8’s are super crystal clear and honest which is perfect for Production but for DJ’ing I always feel like all these monitors there just something missing, it doesn’t have that sort of rich immersive sound lim looking for. 

So I took the E8’s and connected them to my iMac and they will be used for production only.

So I went to a mates get together the other weekend and he had a older Hi-Fi Yamaha Surround sound hooked up to his DJ setup and I was like “Yehhh this is what I’ve been looking for” 

So my question is, I’ve decided to go down the Hifi route, I’ve seen these Sony Muteki type systems on Marketplace going for cheap but is there a setting on these amps to bypass the DSP so I can avoid any latency and lag? Or does someone know straight off the bat which one these Sony amps models/year/make that has direct through sound to avoid the latency/lag problem?

If the second laptop(rekordbox) is connected via DJ prolink is soundcloud streaming feasible or it's only on the downloaded tracks on the laptop?

16,PSA to clean out your playlists/collection (also hit me with your organization tips!),11,1cd2aih,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1cd2aih/psa_to_clean_out_your_playlistscollection_also/,5,"This is obviously basic info, but I've been doing some housekeeping in Rekordbox and it's so rewarding! I'd love to get some insights and tips on how you keep things organized!

I play (very) open format and have been building my Rekordbox collection since I started in 2017. In the early stages I had the approach that it's better to have too much music for my 4hr set, and still I kept running out of songs to fit the vibe. So the collection kept building.

Some of my playlists have been big umbrella lists like ""Everything Hiphop"" or ""Everything 80s"" playlists. These last few years though I've been avoiding browsing those 1000 song lists while playing because they're just overwhelming and fruitless. So instead I stick to my newer, more specific playlists, e.g. ""Lo-fi House"" or ""Latin Disco"".

I realized there were an astonishing number of tracks I've never even played since 2017, which can be either reasonable or unfortunate. So I've started going through all the songs with 0 plays (then 1, 2 etc.) in my playlists and removing a whole lot of meh songs from the collection which were really just added in fear of running out of music. Some get to stay but in some other playlist, some get updated with new tags etc.

It feels so inspiring knowing that there are a lot less filler tracks in there and that the songs are in the playlist they belong! It's a never-ending work of course, but it's so worth it.

This recent study analyzed a sample of 12000 songs spanning 40 years. The findings confirmed an ongoing trend of lyrics becoming simpler and more repetitive.

What's new and somehow not surprising: They also found shifts in the lyrical content. Mood wise lyrics became less happy, more sinister. And the use of self relating words (I, me, myself, ...) has risen, hinting at a more self focussing attitude in society.

Being around the scene, I’ve noticed an uncomfortable number of ‘dj’s’ that give 0 fucks about the craft and only care about the lifestyle and making sure their socials make them look as cool as possible. 

I know it’s a tale as old as time and will always be a part of the industry/culture, but, for those of us that just love music and the craft and don’t need substances to find joy in sharing music you love with others, how did you differentiate yourself? 

To me, hiding my identity makes it more believable that I’m in it for the music and I don’t need to worry about always maintaining appearances/looking cool for instagram. Also I feel like so much of the discourse around music revolves around identity politics these days which to me (queer POC) still feels backwards. Music is one of the most powerful tools of unity we have as a species - it’s a truly universal language! Yet it feels like we often use it as a means of exclusion and ego/status. 

It’s one of the things I’ve always admired most about daft punk (I know their faces are out there but to most people who were unfamiliar with their faces but loved their music, daft punk could have been anyone) and other similar artists, although in recent times, it’s turned into a bit of a gimmick. What are y’all’s thoughts on this?
