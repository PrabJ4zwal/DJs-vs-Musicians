2,Tell me about the first time you got on stage (want to hear from everyone but ESPECIALLY singers),40,1cdwhul,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1cdwhul/tell_me_about_the_first_time_you_got_on_stage/,67,"I started learning guitar around 10 years old, and here I am at 28 and I've still never played a show. I'm such a coward about it. I hate eyes on me in any setting. I can play well when I'm alone, but as soon as I have an audience I start screwing up when playing anything that's not simple. Even if I write something cool and tell my wife to come hear it I'll screw it up every single time once she is present, and then when she leaves I'll get it right again. I was in a few bands as a teen and luckily could play in front of the few friends we would occasionally bring to practices, but I was terrified to get on stage when the time came. I was gonna suck it up and deal with it of course because It would have been more embarrassing to tell my friends I was scared, but fortunately we never made it that far so I never had to.

I've recently been getting into singing more, and my buddy and I have been producing some songs with me doing vocals instead of guitar. I kind of dig it and I think I like the idea of singing. But there's even more expectation for a stage presence as a singer because now you're talking to the crowd and people are paying more attention to you, at least as a guitarist I could just hang off to the side and do my thing. We're not even a band, so there's no plan to play any shows anytime soon. But last night I went to a show, and idk it just seemed so easy.  All these casual people just got on stage, did their thing, had fun, and got offstage. I kept just feeling disappointed that I've let so much time go by and haven't just done it yet.

I'm hoping to hear some of your first show nerve stories and how it went / how you felt afterwards to hopefully help me realize I can do it. So let's hear them!",1714165293.0
3,Think less about what fans can do for you:,14,1cdzrf6,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1cdzrf6/think_less_about_what_fans_can_do_for_you/,2,"Balancing self-expression with serving your audience is crucial for success as an artist. Knowing your target demographic allows you to create content that resonates with them, rather than shouting into the void. 

Your entertainment style (music, fashion, videos, themes, social media, etc) isn‚Äôt for everyone. So who‚Äôs the average fan it‚Äôs for specifically?

Make a list of traits you think they have. For example, a band that sounds like Mumford & Sons will have a disproportionate amount of fans that drive Toyota and Subaru, enjoy hiking, listen to NPR, recycle, etc.

Marketing is a mixture of psychology and sociology. It involves building a brand your niche of followers identify with and nurturing relationships with them through thoughtful content. It's a symbiotic relationship where both artists and fans benefit.

Think less about what fans can do for you and more about what you can do for them.

4,‚ÄúFeeling the music‚Äù,11,1cdx6mz,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1cdx6mz/feeling_the_music/,26,"In college my buddy and I took a music performance class taught by a well-respected jazz reed player. For an assignment we wrote and performed an acoustic guitar duo instrumental piece, and during the performance we were kind of moving our bodies and grooving to the rhythm. The instructor criticized this and pointed out in front of the rest of the class that what we were doing was an unnecessary, fake and ‚Äúmasturbatory‚Äù thing done primarily to convince an audience that you are special and gifted and are ‚Äúfeeling the music.‚Äù

I was kinda embarrassed after that and the situation affected me. I adopted a more stoic stage presence and tried to minimize my guitar face, modeling the professionalism of classical musicians. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd was my model of how this restraint could be shown in a rock music context.

I became judgmental of musicians who display this behavior, even if I liked their music. John Mayer was a good example for me of a talented musician who I unfortunately got second-hand embarrassment watching his head-bobbing and O-face.

I am now trying hard to reserve judgment when others express themselves that way as long as it is done genuinely and authentically.

What do others think? Is this behavior self-serving and done only for show? When you see musicians doing this what emotions and feelings does it invoke in you? Does it make you believe they have an extra special connection to music? Conversely, does the image of a stoic musician somehow diminish their impact for you?",1714166993.0

6,Exciter - Destructor Bass Cover,1,1ceakgt,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1ceakgt/exciter_destructor_bass_cover/,0,"A band that was on my cover wishlist for a long time and on the top with mercyful fate. This one makes me very very happy.

The purest speed metal band and one band always mentioned when the genre speed metal is talked about. Plus speed metal is my favourite genre. Some more factors like Canadian speed metal being an underrated piece of art. These forces were at work pushing me to cover Exciter.

Also I find the genre particularly hard to cover because of the precision and all that speedy alternate picking and chugging. Well, gave my best, working on it and wish to perfect it someday.

The song is one of my favourite exciter songs and underrated, just like the album, the band, the scene, the genre and every single musician in the band. Bass mostly follows the guitars and relatively simple in comparison to other exciter songs. Carries the motorhead like rhythm throughout and takes a U-turn into blazing alternate picking with thunderous double bass drums. Amazing solos as well.

The challenge for me, again was the fast alternate picking and had to mix the song to increase the drums, as is the challenge in most of the 80s speed and thrash metal songs. Important here is syncing the tempo of the song in your head. 

Original Bassist - John Ricci
Genre - Speed Metal
From the album 'Violence And Force'

So last Wednesday I was at an open mic and jam I frequent and after my set this one lady who was there and seems to be a friend of the MC/host of the open mic approached me about playing at a faire in the city. 

I said I was down and gave her my card. In my eagerness, I didn't ask about compensation initially and when I inquired about it over email later and she confirmed it was unpaid or ""about exposure"" as she put it ( I know, yuck), that I shouldn't bring a tip jar and that I'd be granted a pin that would give me entry to this festival for the entire week as well as a wristband for a guest and get free parking on the days I was playing.  She also sent a PDF with the address, some phone numbers, what was expected and what equipment they would have available. 

Looking back it was obvious why she was asking randoms last minute. At the time it just seemed like a good opportunity. 

Anywho, at that point I felt I had already committed, and that I should keep my word. And in my mind, it's not like I'm getting ABSOLUTELY nothing from it. Just no cash. I did end up putting a hat I brought with me at my feet incase somebody wanted to give me a totally unsolicited gift, tho. 
 

I played the first set I agreed to earlier today, and I have another scheduled for Sunday. I'm not dissapointed in my performance. And a lot of folks liked what I do, but I feel a little dirty.  Like I let my local music communtiy down as well as myself by doing this. 

It do seem to have a bit of an out however. They didn't actually have all the stuff they said they would. The pdf said they'd have three 1/4 guitar cables but they had none, so I performed mic'd. That's fine and all, it's not like I've never done it before, but they didn't hold up their end of the deal in this regard. Most of the other equipment was in a sorry state as well, but that's OK. At least they had a PA system. 

What do you guys think I should do?

I think accepting this gig was wrong, in my opinion, but I don't know what the right move going forward is. I feel like any choice I make as of rn is somewhat justified, but I don't know which is best. I don't think these folks are ill intentioned and I don't want to screw them. Many of the staff were very helpful.  But, I  also don't want them to make a habit out of trying to get free performances from people.

Hey everyone,

Wanted to share this story to hopefully inspire some of you on this forum to pursue your passion musically.

I‚Äôm 36 years old and grew up glued to VH1 and MTV. Some of my fondest memories as a kid were staying up late on New Years Eve watching the top 100 songs of the year countdown.

After discovering The Beatles through my parents vinyl collection, I asked for their CD‚Äôs for my 8th birthday. For my 9th birthday, I asked for an electric guitar. I only had that guitar for a couple weeks before my sisters complained and I had to trade it in for an acoustic. It was way too big and after unsuccessfully trying to play it I put it back in its case where it remained for a decade.

About every 5 years I would take it out and attempt to learn. When I got into my Alice In Chains phase senior year of high school I went for lessons but nothing stuck. When Chris Cornell died in 2017 I ordered a new guitar that night. Again, I gave up when I couldn‚Äôt form the chords.

In 2021 I started running with a man named Robert ‚ÄúRaven‚Äù Kraft in my hometown, Miami Beach. Ravens story requires more than a few paragraphs, but to some it up, this man has run 8 miles on the beach every single day since January 1st 1975. The run started out of heartbreak after he found out a hit song he had written was stolen from him.

Ravens dream is to have a hit. Him and I would discuss music every run (to date I have run with him over 220 times). We would fantasize about me learning guitar and him providing lyrics, starting a real rock and roll band.

In the winter of 2021 my job was on strike so I had a lot of extra downtime. I decided once again to pick up the guitar. This time, inspired my Ravens dedication, I decided I would play 1 hour a day, everyday, for the entire year of 2022.

By June, I was comfortable playing in front of my girlfriend. By October, my best friend was coming over once a week and we started forming songs. By November, we felt the music was good enough and all we were missing was lyrics.

We invited Raven over, who penned his 1701st song in about 10 minutes, our first single, Digging Her Grave.

Another runner joined us from Haiti and plays bass, another runner from Serbia came over and introduced his native Tambura to the band. Finally, a man named Bryan we found on Facebook came over and decided he wanted to produce the album.

In 2023 we became Raven and the Dark Shadows. Our first live performance was a disaster, but we regrouped and practiced more. We found a studio and recorded 10 tracks. Through my connections and Raven‚Äôs fame we convinced Dave Abbruzzese (Pearl Jam), Ian Grushka (New Found Glory), Keli Gunnarson (Agent Fresco) and Dave Pastorious (tech 9) to guest on several tracks.

We released our album, An Unkindness, in November of 2023. To celebrate, we had a show at the Wolfsonian with over 150 people attending. 

Jack White‚Äôs Third Man Pressing is currently producing Blue and Yellow vinyl editions of An Unkindness that should be ready by the summer. 

Our song Dracula just reached 30,000 streams. In addition to our music, I produced 4 music videos for our band. A fifth animated one will be out next week.  Total views on YouTube are north of 20,000. 

At a recent Florida Panthers hockey game, our song, Dead End Road, was played after the Panthers scored a goal. It‚Äôs also been used at various Spring Training stadiums around Florida this spring. The Miami Marlins have it on their batting practice playlist. 

We are currently preparing our second album. All the songs have demos, we just have to find the time to enter the studio and begin the process. We hope to have our second album released by October of 2024.

On January 1, 2025, Raven celebrates his 50th year of the streak. We are hoping for more exposure for the band when this happens.

I hope this inspires you all. In my mid 30s I definitely didn‚Äôt expect something like this to happen, but if you really commit to something, dreams can come true. 

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on the project and the sound. I‚Äôd also love to get recommendations on what we can do better, as we prepare for album number 2. Here is a link to our Spotify, thank you!

40,Rant for the multi-instrumentalists ,0,1cdnzkw,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1cdnzkw/rant_for_the_multiinstrumentalists/,46,"Just wanted to rant for a moment because this is 100% a ""problem"" that can only be solved on my own because everybody is different and has different goals in music and I need to figure out what mine actually are, but maybe I can get some inspiration here.

I am by no means an expert at playing anything, I am completely self taught and wouldn't even consider myself intermediate level at any single instrument, but I want to be proficient in playing them and I want to actually improve all the time. For the life of me though, I just cannot commit to just one of them. I'm fully aware that all of the time I spend on each one, (keyboard/synth, guitar, and tenor sax), is time that could be spent focusing on just one of them and actually seeing real improvement. 

But I can't help myself, life feels too short to only experience a single way to play music and I just don't feel too strong of a pull towards one more than the others. They're all fun and rewarding in their own unique ways! At the same time though I don't like the feeling like I'm just noodling around with three instruments and not seeing progress on any of them. In my hubris I convinced myself I could see steady improvement on all three if I stuck to a consistent schedule with them, but life finds a way to ruin your plans really quickly Ive found, making both time and energy really precious commodities.

If there was one I had the most experience with, it would be keyboard, and should probably be the one to focus on more because it's so much more intuitive in general and will give me the most applicable skills to apply to the others (not to mention that I actually play synth for two bands at the moment so that should be enough motivation right there, you'd think...) But I get bored with practicing a single instrument so quickly some days that I find myself rotating around all 3 in a single practice session. 

Can anybody else relate to this?? Are there any aspiring/successful multi-instrumentists that can share their experience or wisdom on this? Even anyone that specializes in a single instrument and why they feel such a draw to that one in particular? I am really curious about your experiences learning and performing music.



EDIT: Reading through everyone's anecdotes and stories is so cool and is really helping me contextualize my own journey with learning music. I think I have a pretty good grasp on how I want to go forward with it all now. Thank you everyone!",1714144527.0

47,Your favorite portable (pocket-size) non-reed instrument for suggestions? ,16,1cctdzv,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1cctdzv/your_favorite_portable_pocketsize_nonreed/,65,"I played Clarinet for years and I travel a lot, plus I'm a circus performer. I've been interested in picking up a woodwind (but open to brass/string) that's very portable (like fits in a large coat pocket type portable), doesn't require much maintenance, but also has some range on it. I was thinking of recorder, but I haven't seen any videos really selling me on it and it has a pretty strong connotation of being a beginner/school kid instrument, which I know is more so just being cheap and easy to give to a kid. That led me to the tin whistle, but it seems very limited, which is a negative effect most small/portable instruments suffer from. 

I would like to avoid instruments with reeds that aren't built in, like the xaphoon, for example, or need electricity/batteries. I would prefer a whistle type mouthpiece, but I'm potentially open to something you traditionally see with flutes if it grabs my attention. I'd also like it to have pretty good range on the type of music it can play, which I know will also vary based on the music itself (trad/folk music from various parts of the world ex: Irish, Japanese, Native Am, etc). 

I even looked at non-woodwind like the pocket trumpet, but it seems to be unpopular due to poor construction, or the pocket violin, but would take a loooot more practice (but I'm comparing that to why I never learned my violin as an adult, because of the time investment just to get to mediocre). I do already have a kalimba which I dabble with, but lacks the range in types of music it can sound like. 

I know that greatly limits my options, but curious if I'm missing something after looking over recorder, tin whistle, pan pipes, quena, native flute, venova, ocarina, harmonica, jaw harp, and more. I'm probably leaning towards tin whistle, because the cost, ease of use, and portability greatly outweigh the con of its limits, but curious if there was something that might fit what I'm looking for better. 

I appreciate the suggestions and looking forward to researching what's mentioned. Thanks! ",1714055349.0

So, in an attempt to help algorithms better understand my own songs and those of other talented musicians I've discovered here on Reddit, I'm creating playlists from time to time featuring bands that complement each other (folk, indie pop, dream pop, indie rock, shoegaze, and all kinds of dreamy vibes). The main goal is to have the algorithm recommend our songs.

&#x200B;

If anyone's interested, please DM me with Spotify links to your songs and a bit about yourself/your band (if they fit the project). Also, send a screenshot showing that you've saved the playlist. I'll disregard anyone who just dumps links without any context of their work or doesn't follow the guidelines for promotion.

&#x200B;

Of course, this will only be effective if people also share and listen to the other bands. Engaging, liking, and commenting on their music also helps establish a connection to the algorithm between their sound and yours. So, if you could check out the bands from this playlist and, if you like any, show them some support! Let's grow together!

&#x200B;

I'm not an expert at this, so any suggestions are also welcome!

&#x200B;

This is the second playlist I've created so far.

We wanted these shows to be focused on people having a good time listening to the music and not getting wasted (like some other house venues in town promote) so we'd plan on trying to draw a pretty tame and respectful crowd.  Recently we learned that our next-door neighbor is a grumpy old lady who has harassed bands who have lived in the house in the past.  These bands used the basement for a practice space and she would yell at them to be quiet, spewing falsities such as lying about the way the noise ordinance works in town.  She would also threaten to call the band's parents (ok??), the landlord (they don't care), and the cops (the only group I am worried about).  I think we should be able to practice without much trouble but we are unsure about the house show thing now.  According to the band who lives at the house now this neighbor has never called the police on them but they have also never hosted shows there.  Generally, the cops in town are not assholes about house shows so I'm not sure there would be much of an issue but I'd still like to avoid it.  One other thing I should add is that this neighbor technically does trespass into the backyard to bang on the windows of the basement when bands have been practicing in the past.",1713819707.0

 A few years back when i was making tons of music i got really friendly with some dude i met on a music production discord server.

And then at one point, his music was like suspiciously good and i realized he was literally sending me music from ncs and was asking me to give feedback on it. I also somehow didnt realize this but on his youtube channel back then(he deleted everything now i just checked) his songs were content ID by small artists! I even asked him about it lol but he just said ""idk people hate me."" 

I just realized that he couldve stolen some of my work or something after i came across some reddit posts of very similar things. Its been like 4 years since and like im getting back into music quite a bit again, and i wanna finish some of these unreleased songs. You guys think if he ripped some of my melodies or music and released it or sold it somewhere, I would still be protected by copyright laws(from Canada btw)?

Bass and Bari Sax. Got eaten alive by college and the job market after, tried several bands afterwards that would go from 6 months to a year of nothing but accolades (top 40 classic rock/ RnB hits, 60s/70s Ska, proto punk like Johnny Thunders, etc).

Rock/punk bands were longer, bitchier projects; always a conflict over whatever could be identified as out of order. A few bands went over years that never returned on the time invested. 

I severely lost interest in music when I had a friend reveal that he was essentially poisoning the well of friends that we both shared in music. This after we more or less got scammed bait and switch style by a singer's ambitions to get laid with someone who more or less had her own musical ambitions that hijacked ours. Long story. 

I've always thought of myself as original, but when most people all the way from family to (what you know as) friends convey all your ideas are garbage, it's better to just assimilate to someone else's agenda, enjoy being the tool, you'll go places, it rips all connection I have with music out. 

I love music when I think it's appreciated. But my experience has been you're only valued so long as you fuel someone else's show. 

How do you put aside all the ""shit"" that you deal with trying to relate to people? I look back on a lot of what I dealt with, and despite getting a DAW and audio interface I just feel disconnected.

Elevator music is the absolutely the wrong concept, but it's more robotic, it's not as organic, and it's hitting things exactly when it needs to be hit and it attacks you.

When you have musicians, and even producers, that take the time to give each sound it's own journey into the open space of that music, it's just distinctly different.  As opposed to someone just layering things over and over with ""that sounds great"" as the leading idea.

I'm probably in my head about this, though.  I know there's tons of nuance.

I'm in late 20s, an instrumentalist(i play drums) and going to be a student at music uni. But recently I have big doubt about my dream. 

In my teenager time although I enjoyed listening music, I never thought to be a musician or make my own music. I started this thing just bc musicians seemed so cool and I wanted to be like them.
Practicing was fine. I liked making my skills better. BUT when I realize I can't do music alone, things started going worse. When I play with others, I feel somehow wrong. I always feel anxiety about I may ruin this so I can't enjoy that time and usually lack of confidence. Is this normal? I guess maybe it is because I've never been in school band or gig with friends. my only experience playing with others is ensemble class at academy. But still...

Also, I feel like I don't like listening to music much. I too easily get tired when I listen to any kind of music. I prefer to do other things rather than listening music in my free time. This is getting worse recently, but I think it's been like this since long ago.

I feel like I'm not going to handle this if I go to uni as I am now. I assume all students at there LOVE music and I know I don't. Tuition fees are expensive and I'm not sure this is worth trying. 

Am I burn out or is this really not my aptitude? Has anyone been the same situation like I am now? I look forward any kind of advice. Thank you.",1713755986.0

I know someone out there has experienced this and hopefully found a solution that I haven‚Äôt tried yet.

I have been releasing music for over a year now. Every time I release a new single, my monthly listeners skyrocket and the song is getting consistent attention. 

Within 1 month, my 24hr streams decrease to half they were the first couple weeks. But I never change my promotion strategy. I know this is a sign of people not liking the song and moving on, but if that was the case, I wouldn‚Äôt have a 10% playlist add rate. Right?

I use submithub, social media, and the Spotify algorithm to get my music heard. Ive never had a TikTok reach over 1k views in my career and I post almost every day. 

I know this may sound crazy, but I know some people who mention that deleting and remaking a different TikTok account may give you more luck and a fresh start. It seems like no matter the content, hashtags, sounds or length of my videos, they don‚Äôt get past 0 views majority of the time.

Anyone have any other suggestions to promote my music in any other ways? I feel like I can implement them and it will hopefully give me some long term listeners to develop my fan base. What am I missing?

I've been creating music for about 20 years. I've recently lost my non-music related full-time job, and am taking this time to find a new project where I can combine my passion (music) with what I most liked about my career (data). 

My musical process is mainly driven by my own personal tastes, intuitions, and creativity (what makes me me). Simultaneously, I am inevitably influenced by the songs and artists that I like the most or that are most successful in my chosen genres. For the latter, I often self-study by active listening and analysis or by consuming videos or data to understand what makes that music great, impactful, and palatable for the audience in these genres. I like understanding, musically, *why* we like it so much. 

I would like to build a project that allows musicians to easily access and understand data related to successful music and its attributes, such as tempos, key signatures, chord progressions, song lengths, themes, and instruments used. The data would be compiled and accessible to understand what current successful songs have in common on a broader scale, to help us, as musicians, be more successful by 1) adapting to trends or 2) differentiating ourselves from trends to help us stand out. 

The purpose of this project is not to encourage artists to ""sell out,"" but rather to leverage data to help us become successful. Just like any other industry, it's important to understand the market we're part of in order to achieve sustainable success, and that's my ultimate aim: helping educate and inform the creative process with data to help us live out our dreams.

I've put together a quick, anonymous survey and would be appreciative of anyone that would like to collaborate. Thank you so much in advance!

A bit of context: I joined a blues rock band over a year ago as a singer. It's a group of four friends from the same village, all in their forties, and I'm the newcomer, the youngest, the girl... 
I got back into music after a long break and I really clicked with the atmosphere. We don't have any ambitions other than having fun. At first, I was finding my groove, no problem, but the more we progress, the more I feel limited.

Well, they're not great musicians, they know it, but I don't hold it against them; playing for fun is also good, and I have another more serious project on the side. I won't dwell on all the problems, because ultimately, they'd probably all be solved if we had a decent drummer.

But our drummer is a nightmare. Can't keep the beat, gets lost in the songs, and is very (very) limited technically. It's awful. I've put in a lot of effort to help him improve, but everything I try fails.

I know that without him, everything would be better, and in fact, I took advantage of a day when he wasn't there to suggest to the others to play along with a drum machine. They played better than ever and they noticed it. 
But here's the thing: as bad as our drummer may be, he's also a good guy. And especially, he's the mega buddy of the two guitarists. So, I don't come out as a winner if there's ever an open ""conflict"" except that...

...They've also all noticed that I push them to do better. Let's say that my outsider perspective encourages them to challenge themselves more than they did before, just among friends... And I can see that they feel inspired to try more complicated things. They would definitely be capable of it with another drummer, once again.

So, the question is:
How do I convince them to say goodbye to the drummer?
Or from your experiences, is it a lost cause, and should I leave the ship or keep my mouth shut? (Which would be ironic for a singer...).

My band has had an ad up for like 6 months.  We're established and have our own studio recorded originals.  People seem to like our music.  We've played around town and looking to expand.   We're basically a turn key solution for a singer that wants to join a band but 90% of the replies we get eventually just ghost us.  I expect a certain amount of that but not after we've met and texted/talked back and forth.  

I've thought that maybe we're sending red flags somehow but I don't think that's it.  We're all responsible adults, some with kids etc...  

So, my original question,  are there other sites or city specific subs on this site that are good for finding band mates?

I‚Äôm seeking recommendations and advice for how to encourage my 4 year old (soon to be 5) kid who loves music and has an obvious natural talent for it.

He was playing drums at 10 mos and strummin on the Loog by 2. At 4, he makes up his own songs with advanced rhyme schemes, impressive timing, and hilarious story arcs. He knows genres by ear and is able to name musicians he knows by hearing any song from their discography. (played some jazz one morning & he goes ‚ÄúJazz musician‚Äôs name again?!‚Äù Haha)  His father & I are decently smart folks but this kid is blowing our minds. We aren‚Äôt the type to toss around the word genius but we do want to do everything we can to help flourish whatever musical talent that is clearly waiting to come out. 

His birthday is right around the corner and we would like to get a few things to set him up to explore his sonic youth. (Corny, I know) Does anyone know of any good kid‚Äôs pianos that have teaching apps? We may buy another Loog cause he smashed the other one like a lil rock star (in reality, he was just too young to have one at the time). Does anyone have any youtube/online music learning channels/classes? Is a drum/midi/synth controller/pad a good idea? He loves the stylophone, is there a larger/louder version that is kid friendly? We don‚Äôt want to break the bank but we do want to invest in something he obviously loves.

Also, how do we do our best to encourage him to continue exploring? We don‚Äôt live in a town with a lot of live shows and the ones that are here happen to be kind of one note (lots of blue grass & country). Is 4/5 too young to start trekking outside our area to go to live shows and concerts?

I got myself a remote job so I could focus on random shit I love when projects aren‚Äôt heavy. I used to tour in my twenties but it wasn‚Äôt sustainable. I settled down‚Äîfocused on a safe career that made money.  That wasn‚Äôt to say that every time I saw a live band I didn‚Äôt kick myself for not putting in the work to bring up there onstage. 

In fact as a dropout in high school and then finishing that, dropping out of college ‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt make music a focus in my life until I could support myself. For anyone who grew up poor and with no safety net‚Äîyou probably get it. But with that I didn‚Äôt surround myself with people who let me live in that world. 

I really do stereotypically believe music IS my life and as a performer all my life I wish I had people around me to jam with. 

Every musician who I hooked up with just didn‚Äôt feel that magic with me and I never played music with someone I was dating. There‚Äôs a huge part of me that wishes I did have that type of love but alas, life goes on‚ÄîI got married and had a kid. 

Then out of performing again I‚Äôve been asked to play and do backup vocals with a really amazing local band that does my genre and style. It‚Äôs honestly really nice even if no one in that band is within +/- 7 years of my age.  (I‚Äôm really grateful to find an opportunity like this late in life because the musician community I grew up around lived ate and breathed it but I could never be that brave.) 

And now in the age of doom scrolling whenever I see advice to do the thing you love so your tribe can find you playing music resonates louder than ever. 

Anyway, aside from the existential threat of knowing what it feels like to deny one‚Äôs self of life‚Äôs basic pleasures‚Äîdoes anyone juggle the same shit out there? How do y‚Äôall keep sane?

It doesn't conform to a specific genre--pop/folk/rock/classical/jazz/soundtrack is the only way to describe it.

To differentiate myself from the zillion other people with my name, I include a middle name. Trouble is, it feels a little stodgy and square, maybe even pretentious, and that's not the vibe I'm going for. It might cause people to not want to listen to it. (It's not that I'm trying to become famous. That ship has sailed, but I'd like to have a little more exposure--who doesn't? I don't gig, so I'm pretty much totally obscure)

Another option--come up with a ""band name"" that is unique and cool (easier said than done). Pros--maybe more people would want to hear my shit. Cons--what about everything I've already released under my own name? It's on all the streaming platforms. Will it be forgotten? Could the potential two names somehow be linked? And could it also be considered pretentious to use a fake name? 

Compare classical music (pretty much 100% using actual names), soundtracks (99% actual names), country (‚âà95% actual names), jazz (‚âà 90% actual names) to pop/rock (maybe 35/65 in favor of stage names).

I am part of a small startup trying to make a platform that makes it easier for newer, independent artists to grow their fan base and get more listens for their music by offering a marketplace of vetted (guaranteed no bots), more established artists (1,000+ and can go as high as 100,000+ fan base) where you can pay for Features and Promotions from the established artist.

Thanks!

Anticipated Platform Highlights:

* Vetted Artists: Access a selection of handpicked artists by genre, guaranteed bot-free with 1,000+ fans and ranging up to 100,000+. Choose based on your budget.
* Customized Options: View artist profiles for effectiveness ratings, music compatibility, social promotion offerings, availability, pricing, and their average response times (or even schedule a Feature).
* Playlist Integrity Monitoring: Our service will actively monitor releases to identify and flag botted playlists, ensuring your music reaches real listeners. Plus, we handle all communications with platforms like Spotify to maintain the integrity of your music's performance.
* Secure Transactions: Funds and products are held until all parties have met the agreement terms.
* Growth Guarantee: If there's no growth, we refund our commission. You only pay the artist for their work.
* Transparent Ratings: See actual growth rates and successful song features for each artist so you can make informed decisions.

Area we are interested in exploring:

* What are your biggest concerns?
* What are your biggest pain points as far as getting more listens, as an artist?
* What are your biggest objections for a product like this?
* For those of you that have already paid for a Feature before, what were the most time-consuming/annoying parts of the process?
* Issues/complaints about the colors, font, etc.

How much is our commission? How much do Features cost?

TLDR; 10% for our commission (though it's zero if you get no benefit). Features in the industry currently run $200-$500+ (plus commission).

Presently many agencies offer a similar service, but they do so for hundreds to thousands on top of the artist's fee. We're hoping to change this and make this great growth method much more accessible (and streamlined).

Growing as an artist and getting ears on your product so you can grow a dedicated fan base shouldn't be as hard as it currently is. We're looking to change that.

**Summary:**¬†We‚Äôre keen to align our services with artists' needs and avoid any community guideline violations, so we won't post our website link here. If interested, drop a comment with your¬†**genre**, and we‚Äôll reach out with a link. We're rolling out based on genre demand‚Äîso your genre will help us know which genres to roll out to first.

244,Need help to remedy amp buzz! Is this ground hum?,7,1c8hb6t,musicians,https://i.redd.it/yu8xifn5ckvc1.jpeg,7,"Buzzing on live sound, potential grounding issue? How to fix?

At my gig earlier today, I have 4 speakers daisy chained and the last one is experiencing buzzing on the live audio, but not on recorded audio. Low volume gig, playing background music for ambiance enhancement. My set up is:

Power
At a convention hall. No wall outlet. Extension cord > power strip > 2 pedals, 3 amps, 1 extension cord to last amp in daisy chain.  for main power. I have the last speaker which is a CoolMusic BP60D (edit: oops, listed this in reverse)

Audio
Instrument > pedals > Eon One MK2 > Eon One MK2 > CoolMusic BP60D amp on stand > Cool Music BP60D on floor (grass/sod) as monitor.

Have switched all cables around, does not resolve buzzing. When the BP60D is unplugged running on its internal battery I'm not hearing a buzz. Buzz exists when volume is on. No buzz when volume is off. 

See pic for set up. A buddy suggested it was a grounding issue and to ditch the power strips. But I don't want to run on battery when I don't have to. I cannot plug in directly to power.

Any ideas on a fix? It's mostly an annoyance. The buzz is not heard on the other 3 speakers that are used for ambiance enhancement, but it is very audible on my monitor. Thank you!",1713587755.0

But sometimes when I'm drifting off to sleep, or when I start daydreaming, a bit of a song will leak out of my subconscious and play in my head. Unlike when I actively recall a song, it will somehow *feel real*, almost like I heard it with my ears rather than my mind.

I downloaded a pitch tracking app out of curiosity. Whenever this happens, I hum what I heard into my phone to see what the notes are, and then I listen to the actual song to see how accurate I was. Most of the time, it's spot on! (Well, within a semitone at least.)

It seems like my brain has the absolute pitch of songs stored inside it somewhere, but I can't access them. They only slip out when I'm half dreaming, completely outside of my control.

I released my first song in January 2024, and have been releasing consistently since.

I come to you today to share a dilemma I have run into. My following on socials and streaming platforms is very very small, and I don't have any friends in the music industry/pathway or even pursuing music as a hobby, so not really any connections either. 

I'm a solo guitarist that can play guitar to pretty much anything music related, since I've been playing guitar for a couple of years and have good music theory knowledge. I've made and released some of my own songs with guitar in them and REALLY love playing as a solo artist (a.k.a. the skill set is already achieved).

**The problem I have** is that I have never played a single live performance (other than my old high school's annual show) and really want to get myself out there and just enjoy performing for people live, but I have no idea how to even start the process. My town is a relatively small town outside of Atlanta called Johns Creek, and it doesn't really have a huge music scene. I don't even know about any open mics or jams in the area. Everything I have read online is telling me to:

* **Join a band** - but I don't think I have the time or overall commitment for that and enjoy being solo
* **Book a venue** - I have no idea how to get this process even started, and don't know about any in my area
* **Use any musical friend connections** - As I stated before, I'm not in contact with that many people, and none of them are in the music area
* **Use live performance experience** - I have none :( so I can't use that as a way to get anything
* **Play at local bars** - I have no idea if the type of music I'm going for is played in those places

I do plan on adding to my playable material and such while also doing cover songs from artists like **Masayoshi Takanaka** and some solo rock guitarists for these live performances.

If anyone wants a sample/example of my guitar playing or one of my songs, feel free to comment asking for that and I will gladly provide.

In this case, I am literally starting from 0, and don't know how to do anything related to live performances, other than the music itself.

I have 5-6 other songs I could release, and I'm trying to decide how to handle it. I feel like people are going to be looking me up because of the awards (there's also a well-attended awards show I'll perform at in around 2.5 weeks) and I'd like them to have more music to listen to, especially since the rest of my stuff is stylistically quite different from the one song that's out. Should I drop a couple songs ASAP? The day of the event? A week later? Only one song for now and then more singles and an album later? My goals are to increase followers on social media and streaming platforms, increase streams on the one song that's out, and maybe get streams on a new release?

My initial thought was to drop an EP the day of the awards show and announce it at the show, but I've heard people don't really listen to EPs and it's best to do singles and then an album.

I'd love some guidance on what sort of release schedule might make the most of this opportunity. The song that's out is kinda Jack Johnson-esque. The other ones I have ready are folkish, indie rockish, and psych rockish, depending on the song. Thank you so much if you took the time to read all of this.",1713455810.0

Anyway the place I‚Äôm taking lessons has like ‚Äúrecitals‚Äùand my grandparents which who are paying for my lessons as well as the employee that schedules lessons wants me to sign up and I said I would talk to my instructor about learning a song and doing the next one. But the thought of that terrifies me. I‚Äôm very anxious and especially socially anxious when the attention is on me or specifically around people my age to the point where I do online school. I know playing in front of people is a must need skill and I want to do it, I think about it often. I did theater when I was younger and though I had a lot of stage fright I still always had other people on stage with me so it‚Äôs much less scary. Not to mention my fears gotten worse so I guess I‚Äôm just asking if anyone else with bad stage fright or anxiety has any advice for playing the first time? I‚Äôve always had this mindset of not showing people stuff until you know you‚Äôre really good and though I‚Äôm progressing, I‚Äôm not great. Also does anyone know what it might be like? I‚Äôm taking lessons at gc. Thanks.

  
Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented didn‚Äôt expect this much. A lot of very useful tips that have definitely made it seem much less scary.

I'm in Buffalo, NY. We definitely had some hits. Goo Goo Dolls, 10,000 Maniacs, Cannibal Corpse, Every Time I Die, Snapcase. Obv not every diy band is going to make it out of the rest, I would consider even 1/10th the success as the aforementioned bands as success. Even if there is great value to just being a part of a scene, whether or not your music lives or grows outside of local shows, I still feel like many people don't have the drive that I see in other cities and other scenes that get bands touring and eventually headlining.

There are the no-duh places out there like NYC, LA, Chicago, Philly. But also Richmond, Providence, Pittsburgh, San Antonio all seem to be much greater hubs to find people who are willing to be dropouts and live out a band and have fun. A lot of rust belt cities seem to enjoy the band stuff on the weekends as a night out but the drive really stops there. Idk.

i know the first step is to have good music, aka music im genuinely proud of but sometimes even good content doesnt get engagement if its hidden or if people just havebt built a connection to the person posting or so. but i also dont want to make myself seem too accessible to people so i dont want to be too casual and overshare in my posting on social media or make everyone feel like theyre my friend - i want to maintain a professional distance a) to make sure there are no problems later on down the line where i feel like i have to maintain all these people or have overly familiar listeners and b) make sure the people who like my work especially at the start like my work for the actual work itself and arent just engaging out of obligation or so

im sure i contradicted myself a couple of times but im just trying to loosely debate this in my head and thought doing so with some input could be insightful

maybe im not at a point where i should be worrying about things like professional distance and should just max out every sort of interaction or chance for someone to support me that i could get but idk i have faith that another way or even multiple routes are possible. also if youre a musician who lands gigs or considers yourself to have achieved some goals when it comes to listeners and wouldnt mind sharing how that worked for you please do! i'd appreciate hearing some evidence of how it can work out in non traditional (or traditional!) ways

Now you might be thinking I‚Äôm a control freak, and while I do have my own vision of what the band should be, I CONSTANTLY ask other members to take on some of these responsibilities or to give me meaningful feedback. I always either send mock ups of the art, conversations with organizers, or WIPs of the songs that I‚Äôm writing and ask what they think. And they either straight up don‚Äôt give me a response or give me vague critiques like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it‚Äù or my favorite ‚Äúmy opinion is nebulous‚Äù. I‚Äôve asked them to help me write riffs, make their own merch designs, or to help out with logistics ect. But then in return, they get upset with me when the output is not what they imagined or I make creative decisions on my own. And the few times that they have stepped up to do something they expect that what they make will absolutely not be criticized in any way. 

I told them that essentially I can‚Äôt read their mind, and if they want more of a say, they can take up more responsibilities and use clearer communication. But that was brushed under the rug, do I quit? Or do I figure something out.",1713330465.0

We've been booked as the band for a TED-talk in our hometown. When we agreed on this gig it's been said there was full technical service (FOH, mixer, PA, etc). No fixed payment but a tip jar plus a follow-up interview on the local radio show. This was months ago. 
Even though we've asked multiple times, it was only a couple of days before the gig until we got contacted by the ""sound guy"". That guy is actually a DJ and has little to no experience in mixing Bands, neither does he have a console, mics or anything else. 

Right now, it looks like we'll have to bring everything by ourselves except for the PA. We've discussed this within the band and decided we'll play the gig for tips, but we'll charge a flat fee for the technical equipment (mics, mixing console, etc).

So for context, I had basic musical training when I was a kid (reading notes, learning keys and scales) but that's pretty much the extent of my formal training. I started with piano and learned guitar and then went to boarding school, so I couldn't get the instruction I was receiving anymore. 

My mum noticed pretty early that if I heard a song, I could fairly match the basic melody on the piano if I heard it enough times. Since then and now in my young adulthood, I've become more of a guitar enthusiast, and over the years, I can say that most of the time now,  if a song is playing, I can pick up the melody (and sometimes harmonize) in a couple seconds while it's being played. The main issue is I don't know how. 

I have no idea what notes I'm playing most of the time unless I actually try and pay attention to my finger position (which is hard to do if you're trying to match something on the fly). I can't explain to people how it happens but it just feels like if I can hear the song in my head, I can try to guess/predict where the next note will be. I'm grateful for the ability to do this but I'm also deeply frustrated by it sometimes because I would like to know what I'm playing. I would love to be able to identify what key I'm in, and even go up a level by figuring out what chords to play for the song rather than just the basic melody. However, I feel stuck and unsure of how to proceed from here (I'm also not in the position to get lessons because I'm a broke college student :( .

I prefer to use amp simulators to real amplifiers when playing guitar, as I can get a wider range of tones with amp simulators and can record my practice more easily. However, I'm having a problem with the sustain. I'm currently practicing vibrato exercises using a metronome. I've noticed that the guitar(I have a squire strat) cuts out sharply after it gets under a certain volume. At first I thought it was a guitar issue, however after playing around with turning up the gain on my audio interface, I noticed that I got more sustain(however the signal started distorting very badly). Does anyone have any idea what the underlying issue causing the lack of sustain and what I can do to help get more sustain.

is this life just a mission we‚Äôre in 
i wish we were free 
free to be what we wanna be 

obsessed with drugs
obsessed with love 
i just wanna kick 
my feet up in the dark 
lighters up in the park  
how im feeling so far 
is like i‚Äôve come from a far 
shining in the sky just like a shooting star 
life never seems to go that far

3.

you wanted time and now your wanting more 
i watch it rain it pours onto the floor
and i saw her crying crying on the floor 
i keep on trying trying more and more 
yet in my core 
i am finding something or maybe more 
find myself asking if i‚Äôm okay for sure 

i lost my place so just incase
 i find my mind i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll erase 
all those times i was fucked up and laced  

4.

‚ùî
everyone know time can‚Äôt erase 
time fill your space with unforgettable memories of her face 
i‚Äôve been tryna move at a different pace 
i can‚Äôt lie i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll make it 
through i just wanna know is your love really true ? 
got me breathing through a plastic tube everybody want a love that‚Äôs true
 that‚Äôs why i can‚Äôt stop fighting for you 
my brain will rot till i flop on the ground 
there‚Äôs never enough love to go around 
spin my words in my mind 
i ain‚Äôt never met anyone of my kind 
‚ùî

hit me up if you like any of this i need to push myself to get out there it‚Äôs hard for an artist/ producer to get recognition i feel like you have to be your own unique style :)

My ex left our family abruptly a little over a year ago. We are both musicians and in fact that is how we met originally. 

When he first left, since he totally disassociated he was free to play open mics and establish himself in the local community by playing every single night while I dealt with all the responsibilities of our home, daughter, pets, finances, not to mention the deep depression of having someone you love for 11 years walk out on your family. 

I played a few open mics here and there to get my creative juices flowing again. And I found a good community near my home which was a bit far from him. But then he started going there as well. Since he did so, and since I can't get out as frequently as he does because all the responsibilities were left on me, he ruined the few friendships I had established.

He is everywhere, knows everyone now. And I've begged him to please talk this out as I am completely alienated. He seems to be enjoying the control. I didn't cheat or anything- in fact he did. And he abandoned his step daughter of 11 years. But I have been the one dealing with the backlash. 

How do I get back out there knowing the music community is a tight arena and I don't want anyone caught up in this mess? Especially since he's completely taken over the local scene? I really need some help. We're all musicians here, without this outlet and opportunity to even make friends that are musicians I am so isolated.

I play keys and guitar in a variety of genres, though I mostly dabble with Latin styles (Cumbia, ranchera, bolero), r&b, and rock. I love collaborating music writing with other people, but would love to make my own independent songs as well.

There are many songs I have written with a fleshed out form, harmony, bass, and melody, but I‚Äôve been sitting on for years because the threshold for me to lay down lyrics is so incredibly high. Coming up with musical motifs is second nature to me, but once I start writing lyrics, I hate them almost immediately, and then I stop altogether for months at a time.

Does anyone have any tips for writing or drafting lyrics in a systematic way? I feel like I need a system to get through lyric writing or I‚Äôll be always stuck.

I am watching on stream, but anything above the lowest octave on the instrument sounds like a cheap bass being pushed too hard through little cheap Ampeg combo. The rest of the mix sounds good, so I'm assuming it's on the performer's side and that is the intentional sound being produced.

I'm aware of a certain desired tone/sound especially for the more ska, punk, and reggae influenced sounds, but it's so obtrusive in the mix. I'd def chill on those low-mids that sound like their being pushed really hard on the performer side of the gain staging.

I'm curious what others who have watched the stream think about that choice of tone, or if you think it's something lost in translation due the stream mix. Obviously this just my opinion but I'd love to hear what other musicians think about it and if my judgement on the tone is misplaced or not.

Note: I mixed live sound (primarily rock, punk, ska, reggae, metal, etc.) for about 8 years. Also, I have a friend (non-musician) working the festival who says it's probably the stream mix.",1713135203.0

I‚Äôm looking for some advice and thought maybe some users here would have insight.  I just released my very first single. I‚Äôve pasted links below for Apple Music and Spotify. 

I have five other songs that have been produced and just need to be mixed and mastered. 

But I don‚Äôt really know which direction to go‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt foresee myself spending hours a day on social media, curating content. 

But I also don‚Äôt see myself going out and playing covers in bars every night. 

To be clear, I‚Äôm happy to play live. I‚Äôd just like to do so in an intentional setting. 

I‚Äôd really like to attract the attention of a record label that shared enthusiasm in my work and such. But I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs how the cookie crumbles nowadays. Any ideas? 

Edit: my focus with this post is to try and hear NEW IDEAS. I agree 100% that the standard avenues today are to gig and put content online. 

Here‚Äôs a few suggestions I‚Äôve heard in the past and in these comments: 

‚Ä¢ entering singer/songwriter competitions 

‚Ä¢ attending music conferences with a music portfolio 

‚Ä¢ create a schedule of open mics in your area and do those weekly

‚Ä¢ dedicating extra funds to booking agents, social media management, etc. 

In the not-so-distant past, people who marketed themselves online were laughed at. Now, it‚Äôs the only way. Does it seem possible that in the future, there may be alternative routes for attracting an audience?

Here in the UK, mostly when you start out, it's very rare to get paid for a show. Here there's a lot of door deals, where a venue give you a cut of the money from the people that came to the venue to see you specifically. Obviously no one knows who you are, and getting just a small handful of friends can be very difficult if it's a crappy day of the week and you don't play until 10pm.

I've always thought about it this way, a venue needs to make money, if you don't bring anyone then no money is going over the bar and the venue are losing money with staff and running costs. It's the music BUSINESS, so if you can't make any money for the venue, then why should they give you anything?

It just ends up sounding incomplete somehow when played live. 

So... I'm thinking like... when Richard Dawson or Jake Xerxes Fussell play live, it doesn't sound like it's missing anything. It sounds like it's *supposed* to be played solo - one guitar, one voice, even when - in the case of RD - it's climactic and loud and almost metallic sounding.

Even Elliott Smith, or Junior Brother, who has been recommended to be off the back of loving Richard Dawson's work, augments his live shows with other musicians.

I want to be influenced by music which is authentic, idiosyncratic, and sounds like it was supposed to be played by one person and a guitar. 

I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me some artists to draw influence from. No particular genre, but preferably not Jeff Buckley or that type of thing.

i have love for it but at the same time SOOO much heartache comes with it (and so many breakdowns) because as the improvement curve becomes gentler and my expectations increase with my increase in skill level, reaching expectations becomes harder and I just get less satisfied that i see little to no improvement. It's honestly what holds me back from pursuing music professionally. I enjoy it much more when im messing around and not caring, but thats at the cost of good playing

Does anyone else have this issue?",1712975334.0

Heavy is the word. Just 3 musicians and they make it sound like an entire army is playing the war anthem.

Mikkey Dee is the MVP here, killer playing, killer writing and killer drummung. Especially during the solo, which was quite common when he had joined motorhead, especially in bastards and sacrifice. Phil is great at his job too.

Lemmy seems to be on some good goodamn intense high, vocals are as hellish as they have gotten in motorhead. The bass is at the peak of distortion, mostly complements the guitar on this one. 4 minutes and makes the body sore as hell.

Only challenge is the intensity of the song, one of the most intense songs I have covered. Figured out the tabs by ears. 

Genre - Thrash Metal / Heavy Metal 
Original Bassist - Lemmy Kilmister
From the album 'Snake Bite Love'

I am planning my wedding for this coming June. My wife (we got married - just couldn't afford the wedding until now) has played violin for almost 10 years and one of her only requests during early planning was to have live violin during our ceremony. 

Due to some unexpected issues with finding a venue, we haven't been able to start looking for a lot of our vendors until recently, including ceremony musicians. Most musicians we've reached out to have been unavailable, so we started reaching out to people we knew, friends of friends, etc. 

My sister's roommate volunteered to play. I asked my sister for her contact information and if she has a rate that she already charges. My sister is majorly busy (engineering student), so I haven't heard back from her. We are requesting she play a specific song for the walk. She would be playing for 1-2 hours. She would also be invited to attend the reception as guest (if she wants) if that changes anything.  I want to be able to to properly budget for paying my sister's roommate and was wondering what people would recommend as a rate for this.

What do you do on those days when you need to work on your playing, but every little mistake just feeds into the ‚ÄúI suck, how did I ever think I could go pro with this, if I haven‚Äôt gotten *this*(details in a second) by now, how will I ever get it‚Ä¶‚Äù

I always wonder if I‚Äôm expecting too much from myself‚Ä¶ I joined this band 6 months ago. We‚Äôve got some 60+ songs in the repertoire, no charts on stage, and the band leader wants to be a grateful dead style ‚Äòno set lists‚Äô on stage. I play bass, and it‚Äôs folky stuff (so no crazy Geddy Lee level bass lines)‚Ä¶ but am I crazy to try to expect to have all these arrangements memorized by now? This is my first dive into being a full time musician, with a local band that‚Äôs *just* starting to break out nationally.

Trying to find a house and move states definitely hampered my practice time the last 3 months‚Ä¶ but this band is my job - it‚Äôs my responsibility to have my shit together. It was a little easier in November/December because we were playing or practicing once or twice a week. Along with moving, we‚Äôve only had 2 gigs a month in feb/march/april, and I haven‚Äôt been practicing with the band leader at all. All the band practice has been on-boarding the new fiddler or working on studio prep for our first album.

I‚Äôve gotten much better over the years, but this past year or so, more and more, it‚Äôs been getting worse. Not in the way that my skills are degenerating, but I‚Äôm having new issues.

For example:

I‚Äôm reading notes as if they are a step or so off from where they actually are. I see a note, and i can play the note that my eyes think it is automatically, but i look closer and it‚Äôs not the note i SAW it as. 

Lots of ink can mean i can‚Äôt decipher anything. My actual rhythm literacy is just fine, but everything just melds together when i see it too close together on the page. This goes for rhythm, for a ton of accidentals, whatever else.

In addition, things like noticing myself sitting much closer to my music, leaning in more during more complex passages, and writing marks in my music noticeably larger, darker, and more frequent than my stand partners and neighbors all make me convinced that I do indeed have problems with my vision.

Has anyone else had this problem? Was it because of bad vision? Did you notice a significant improvement in sightreading ability or general comprehension once you got glasses? 



TL,DR: I misread notes, lots of ink means i can‚Äôt see, and i sit closer and add more and bigger marks to my music. I think i have vision problems that are crippling my sightreading. has anyone else dealt with this?

There's no platforms for new listeners to go after new music.

If you're an artist on spotify you don't even know the people that listen to you. You don't have a way to connect with your audience!

I'm not saying you don't need to promote your music. I'm just saying there's no platform that will at least make you be heard if you don't go around posting some links. And this is not  good!

I don't know about you guys, but all my friends only discover new music on spotify. Not sometimes on soundcloud, sometimes on youtube, ONLY on spotify.

There's no mail list, no liking or replying comments from fans, no way to make your audience feel like they are part of a group.

I have (in the past) blown off an opportunity to live out a part of my dream to make a living playing guitar, due to anxiety and stress. I have another opportunity now. I'm forcing myself to go thru the motions this time, but just thinking about memorizing 50 songs, playing 'good' on stage, stage presence, social aspect.. makes me weak. 

---Tips on how to deal or work with this anxiety?   
Stories of your experiences of making the switch from amateur endless-repetition bands to (semi-)professional musician life?



[Long version, extra info and blabbering]

So I've been playing guitar for a long time and one of my old bands' bandmembers, has since gone 'professional'. Also, since then he has forwarded or recommended me to similar bands 'in his scene' at least twice (he's such a great friend and bro for that and I feel like such opportunities really are not be wasted.. but I know I'm a guy that wastes opportunities..). 

These bands are regional party-cover bands that play 2-3x a week for ~1k to ~3k people.

I just can't seem to take the plunge, my heartbeat goes wild just thinking about it (being on stage for large crowd, being expected to sound good -to drunk crowds but also bandmembers and mostly myself probably-, I'm not much on the social part and as a non-alcoholic don't enjoy staying around long after jams or shows).

I am a more technically developed guitarist than my friend (I am a practice nerd but to be fair I also started playing the instrument years before he did), but his confidence and trust in me is much bigger than I have for myself. I make up a million excuses for why I couldn't do it, or imagine myself on stage and somehow my stomach churns and I think I'll do bad or something? I know I can play okay on the guitar, but I suffer hard from the imposter-syndrome ish thoughts and often project my insecurities in imaginary future situations.. I hope you get the point.

I feel like the cliche where at this point the biggest thing holding me back from achieving my dreams, is me lol. 

---How do you know if you can do it? 
What was it like for you?Does anyone of you struggle with anxiety as a performing musician? Can you point me in the right direction, do I need to 'just do it', am I not cut out for it? Also, How did you transition from the 9-5 salary life?",1712884775.0

It's just drumming is nothing I can't do and im not sure the guy deserves another shot. Even if I forgive him.

i could use your help understanding the needs and wants of musicians.

As a student project i need to design a physical product for musicians. It will be sold by a record label but can really be anything you could use or need as a musician.

As i like to listen to music, but have never had any close contact with people that actually make music, i would like to know ~~what do you expect from a record label when creating a song or an album?~~

What problems do you encounter during the production of music?

What problems do you encounter when performing on the stage?

It would be nice if you could also include what kind of music you make.

From this post i hope to get a feeling for the problems that exist within the music industry. Any help is appreciated.



Thanks :)

  
Edit: 

Its not like the label would force you to buy their product. The goal is to expand the brand into a direction that allows them to also sell physical products, so maybe focus on the questions about what problems you encounter when producing or performing music.",1712852478.0

So I'm a semi professional keyboardist, my current rig consists of a Roland JDX-i 37 keys and a Yamaha P-125 88 key. I currently play in a metal band and in a wedding band. 

The metal band is mostly originals and just a few covers, where I'd need mostly a good strings, choir, strong church organ and ocassionally some electronic stuff. A good guitar like sound (jordan rudess style) would be very useful. 

In the wedding band we mostly play pop and rock songs but I need the synth quite a lot for that and sometimes it's difficult to get the sound I want, not that I can't edit it but I need to be able to access these sounds quickly and easily really. 

Im looking to upgrade mostly as I feel the sounds I have just aren't that good and the roland jdxi means it takes me a while to switch sounds sometimes. Ive checked how to save sounds to favourites on the roland but, honestly, it's pretty buggy. I had the Novation mini nova before and although the sounds were a bit too weird, the sounds were much easier to access quickly. 

Im tempted to try a midi keyboard where I can load the sounds but a laptop during a live show worries me cause what if it crashes or something so I'm a bit skeptical about that.

Im open to any suggestions from more experienced people perhaps, really appreciate any feedback or suggestions you've got :) ",1712840598.0

EDIT&TLDR: View AI as another paintbrush or as a new form of keyboard‚Ä¶AI in and of itself is no more art than a paintbrush, in desperate need of a painter to steady it‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

What started out as a rant against those who are afraid of AI in the arts, evolved into a tip that I believe will help many of you who are concerned: using AI to further your compositions. 

Any great artist knows that exposure and reference are huge assets (primarily in developing talent) but also in becoming inspired. Instead of viewing AI as a never ending source of soulless music - view it as the next evolution of iTunes; the Record Shop; the Library; the Opera House; simply a place to find new ideas

Imagine you have an idea in your head. You type it into Youtube to try and find something similar but alas, to no avail. Instead, take it into something such as SUNO. Knowing how AI works, it is fair to assume this is an amalgamation of existing compositions. So generate your prompt. BUT don‚Äôt stop there! Bring that piece into your DAW or transcribe it. Rewrite the melody. Sample it into a new beat. Deconstruct the harmony and harmonize against it. Take the melody and write new lyrics. A prompt isn‚Äôt yours. MAKE IT YOURS. 


Look, i know it‚Äôs easy to think that this is uncharted territory. But it‚Äôs not. Humans have innovated since time immemorial. Make it your tool. Don‚Äôt become it‚Äôs b*tch.

**Advice needed!!!!**

But then life happened, and I ended up majoring in something that promised more cash flow than melody. Now that I am a little more settled and have some money to invest in my musical interest, I want to keep pursuing music.

I've decided it's time to reignite the musical flame within me, but I need your help, oh wise ones of the musical realm! I'm looking to invest more into my musical abilities, with dreams of teaching music to kids and maybe even gracing more stages with my presence. **But where do I start?**

Don't actually engage with fans, ect. One of my biggest lessons was to start taking myself seriously as an artist and stop just dropping on Bandlab and Snapchat with a song I made in a day posting it on my story and calling it good.

I have no tik tok, do not even know what a PR firm is or does, have no marketing plan, no costumes, no videos, no plans to do live performance 

why did I expect to ever blow up? 

From now on i plan to take songs slow 100s of takes if I have to, only make music that actually means something to me emotionally, and actually pay for stems send projects to professionals to get mixed, have a marketing and roll out plan. I hate even making this post instead of just doing it but I feel like it needs to be said and maybe actualizing it into words is good.

sometimes I feel like leaving this reddit because of all the sad people who want to be famous and the lack of actual creative conversation. 

It sounds weird but maybe because you want to blow up, you're making music for it to be received well rather than truly expressing yourself and that hides the uniqueness that you could be bringing to music.

Yeah that rapper kinda sucks and has millions but he also is himself and took his music and art seriously and went and learned the professional route to producing and marketing a record.

Even your favorite great artists or underground artists, they didn't get traction until they got professional help in some shape or form and they invested thousands and thousands into even the earliest records

Get references, and inspiration, plan hard and invest into a more professional route, to the rappers out there, even Kanye has to have his beats go through multiple people and levels of mastering 

Take yourself and the art seriously to the most meticulous level of expression,  produce records that actually mean something deeply to YOU, and Invest into professional help and knowledge to get them out to the world and I guarantee you wouldn't be on Reddit complaining about others making it.",1712636200.0

577,Rant: I'm a longtime musician whose struggling not to hate even the very concept of music anymore,66,1bzbp8g,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1bzbp8g/rant_im_a_longtime_musician_whose_struggling_not/,231,"So I've been playing music my whole life, and guitar especially since I was in middle school. I've loved it and enjoyed it my whole life. Music has been a major part of who I am. I've played for fun, played gigs for money, played just for the sake of it, etc. I enjoy all genres, country, math rock, metal, gospel, everything. I just loved music.

Writing music has always been my favorite part of music, and composition is the main driver for why I have continued to play. I can't listen to songs without ""hearing"" new parts, so as a result I've never really listened to much music, plus I get more obsessed with whatever new earworm popped into my head. Moreover, I sing my own made up melodies in church (we do acapella only) since I can express the music I feel like should be. I can't even walk around without getting my own made up melodies stuck in my head, and the only cure has always been to learn the part on an instrument. As a result, I've made a lot of great songs, some fading into obscurity and some gaining some traction, though I only ever did it for its own sake rather than that it would be appreciated--like if a song I kept hearing against my will didn't exist and I didn't actualize it then it felt almost like the world was not right and thus I must actualize it. Music has become such apart of my life, my son's middle name is a pun for music (that I can't share since this is a throwaway).   


Lately, though, I just look at all my gear, all my skills, the time I've spent on its vanity, and I just find myself filled with disgust and resentment. I hate that I spend time playing music rather than learn a practical skill like wood working or being with my family. I hate that I am so drawn to an instrument, and I hate that I can't bring myself to rid myself of them as many were gifts. I find myself now even hating everything about the concept of melody, harmony, rhythm, the fact its intelligible, the fact it manipulates emotions for better or for worse rather than what the person genuinely feels without modification. I hate that it distracts me, I hate the fact that I can't be free of it when I sleep at night and a melody comes to me against my will. I hate that I can't go to church and worship without hearing music, that even when I try to ""shut off"" and just focus on the Lord. I hate that I can't escape the unheard melodies plaguing me as a lock up my house at night, nor can I walk around listening to a podcast without some made up sound tormenting me. I hate that I can't sit in silence in my car without an old song coming to mind, or a conversation with someone reminding me of a song I once heard and the melody embedding itself into me. I hate that I can't listen to other people's music without wanting to join in or appreciating it as it already is. I hate the idea of monetizing my music to the extent that I live off it, but I also hate the idea of not monetizing something I've spent so much time and effort refining. I hate the feeling of shame of playing instead of doing something else, and I hate the shame of feeling like I wasted my life refining a vain skill.  


I don't feel burnt out; I feel cursed. I love music, I think, but I am becoming overwhelmed with disdain and hatred for it. Honestly, I **never** want to hear another note again in my life again, questioning if I would be happier deaf, but I also shudder at the idea as I doubt I could escape my curse of creativity.",1712615636.0

After considering all your perspectives, getting an opinion from a good buddy who has worked with the artist numerous times in the past, and having a follow up convo with him not having time for a jam sesh but explaining his music mentality and methodology, and weighing the risks vs benefits, I have decided to give it a go with the artist I posted about. Mahalo!

I have a VIP client that I do all their expos for as a duo. My bandmate recently quit music so I've been building up an alternate roster. We do live looping, live jamming lounge instrumentals. The gig is to provide low level background music to greet expo attendees at the front door. I've brought on one new bandmate that I've busked with several times, so there's been a certain level of vibe and trust established. There are two days, my new bandmate is taking day 1 with me. I would ideally like to use day 2 for another musician to expand the bandmate roster for future gigs. If not, I'll bring in the new bandmate.

One much more established musician in my network has expressed interest in the gig. I've seen him perform many times, we know each other through these performances as I have worked many events with his talent buyer. However, we don't know each other on a personal level, have never hung out outside a show, or ever played music together. Show is in a couple weeks. I've asked to jam first to see how we vibe and he says he's too busy. I'm only considering him an option because I've seen him perform before several times, like his music and it would be fun to perform with him. I have expressed to him that this is my VIP repeat client and I do not want to deliver a less quality product than what they are used to. He says as long as he knows the keys it'll be fine. I get this, but I think there's a lot more to vibing in a performance duo than just knowing the keys.

I've only ever performed a paid gig with people I've jammed with before. Am I being too anal here? Do you guys have wisdom to share? I'm currently leaning towards a no.

These actions have gotten me in a bit of bother. A great guitarist and good friend of mine was this kind of player who didn't practice. I passed the next gig off to another guitarist and he was really upset with me, saying that ""as a band leader, I would have appreciated a lot more direction from you and we would not have had this problem"".

611,Serious discussion about the future of music and the value of ‚Äúhuman music‚Äù vs ai generated music.,0,1bzmlz7,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1bzmlz7/serious_discussion_about_the_future_of_music_and/,90,"So recently I‚Äôve seen some applications that can create some really incredible simulations of music. I think this is awesome and is (imo) kind of one of the final steps toward true ‚Äúpunk‚Äù expression. A literal music generation technology from the psyche of any person would be the only think I can think of beyond that.

I think it‚Äôs amazing how far the technology has come and has increasingly made ‚Äúnon-musicians‚Äù be able to make music. I know that sounds elitist, but I mean it in the best way possible. I don‚Äôt literally mean I don‚Äôt consider purely production or raw perseverance based musicians musicians, but if we consider the act of musical performance a trade in itself I think it is a fair argument to make that there are musicians and then there are MUSICIANS. Feel me?

Anyway with this being the case now, what is the future like for musicians, and do you believe the trade of music will become irrelevant or more respected?

I personally believe that if literally every person could just start generating music down the line it would definitely topple the recording industry entirely at some point and would take a lot of emphasis off of celebrity as a method of ingesting music and art. However, I do think maybe the perceived value and appeal of those that can learn, perform, or improvise music would go waaaay up. It would kind of recast musicians as what they are meant to be, which is a tradesmen of entertainment. Not a special genius that speaks for a generation or some corny shit, just dudes good at making sounds happen fr.

I also feel like if people can generate recordings themselves, the value of seeing music that is not immediately being performed would be diminished. Not entirely, but I definitely think it would be less sought after.

Also, down the line if people can generate ideas brain to reality in the future, imagine how insane bands could become and what fusions of analog performance with bio-digital could entail?

Idk what do you think?

615,Band Roles: Who gets royalties/pay?,28,1byjj4s,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1byjj4s/band_roles_who_gets_royaltiespay/,51,"I play bass in a band whose name follows the formula ‚ÄúSinger Songwriter and the Something Band‚Äù

The singer is the band leader and writes all of the songs before bringing them to the band to put together. We each write our own instrument parts for the songs. 

The singer books gigs which we split evenly. The singer also financed the recording of the EP that was just released. 

None of the band members were paid for writing and recording their parts,and also won‚Äôt get any royalties because we didn‚Äôt write the songs, but did write our parts.

I guess my question is, when you are a band member and not just a hired gun, what should you be getting paid for and what should you be getting royalties for? Should I ask for a minimum for every gig regardless of how much we get paid total? Should I ask to be paid for rehearsal time where I write my part to his song? Should I be paid for studio time where I record the part to his song?
(I realize at the level we are at, the financial aspect of royalties are far less important than the principle) 

EDIT: Thanks for all the thoughtful responses 

For Background‚Ä¶ Singer wrote and recorded an album with session musicians, then decided to put a band together so he could play it live. All of the songs he‚Äôs written since the first album have been written by him alone then arranged by the band in rehearsal. When he said he wanted to record the EP with those new songs, he took care of everything. But the line is kind of blurred between band member and hired Gun because Singer paid for the studio, mastering, etc, but the idea of paying the band for studio time never came up and I‚Äôm wondering if it should have, if we have no true stake in the band. Or should we have a small percentage or the royalties for being the band that recorded all of the songs and had input on putting them all together in rehearsals? ",1712534473.0

Hi all, I wanted to ask some things, and I don‚Äôt really have anyone in my life that can answer them right now? I‚Äôm a music major (22f), so far have talked to a therapist who said I most likely have moderate ADHD, and I‚Äôm struggling SO MUCH to practice. I‚Äôve tried to look up other stories online to see if anyone else has the same experience as me, but it seems like the majority of people are able to really easily focus on music because it‚Äôs something they‚Äôre really passionate about? I‚Äôm struggling to have a routine, actually put in work for my degree, etc, and it constantly makes me feel like maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be in this major because I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot as passionate.‚Äù

Once I start, I love practicing, but I like playing with other people in the large performing ensembles more. I‚Äôve always really, really enjoyed it, and ever since elementary/middle school when I picked up an instrument, I haven‚Äôt had any rhyme or reason with practicing (which at this point, isn‚Äôt helping me at all, it‚Äôs SO HARD to learn what I need to learn, and I feel like I‚Äôm sabotaging myself). I feel like I used to totally hyperfocus more on music too when I practiced, but as I got older, I shifted focus more away from music. I love it, so much, but I feel like something is wrong for me for not actively hyperfocusing on music like I think would be nicer at this point. One thing I DO hyperfocus on is crochet, I got back into it a couple of years ago and have done a ton with it. But, I wish I could just apply that passion to music, something that I know I love, everyone around me tells me I love, but I can‚Äôt seem to actually show that love, I guess. 

Would anyone have any tips or tricks? Planners really haven‚Äôt worked for me in the past, and I‚Äôve had a terrible track record with trying to establish new habits. I just want to feel like the main portion of my degree isn‚Äôt such a struggle, maybe know how to motivate myself, and feel like I deserve to be there in the first place. I‚Äôve had a ton of imposter syndrome over the past few years, and I wish I didn‚Äôt treat practicing like every other procrastinating assignment.

Without visual media (i.e. tiktok, screens making concerts more interesting, websites etc), do you think music would have such a prevalence today?  

How have music videos and live visuals changed the way we experience popular music compared to, say, listening to the radio? 
 
Do you think visuals can make a song more popular, even if the music itself isn't that strong? 
 
Has the rise of streaming platforms like YouTube changed the expectations for how music should be presented?

We've traveled in a Sienna before for a weekend show and had a lot of space, but also we didn't bring the drum kit.

Do you think a smaller vehicle, like a Toyota Sienna or a Honda Odyssey would work? Or should I look more at a Ford Transit or Sprinter van?

I don't mind being a little cramped (plus, the sienna is like $2k for the month, vs a sprinter is more like $5k and worse on gas), but what worries me is that we start loading everything up and realize that we can't fit all our gear & luggage in!

I‚Äôm looking at getting in a studio down the road with one of my songs that is gaining traction, and maybe reworking it a little while in the studio to get it where I want it to be. I have zero experience with recording studios and even less with mixing, mastering and engineering, and I really don‚Äôt know how all that works. I have a musician friend who does not live in the same area as me but he has a home studio and he has been  recording the instrumental tracks. He sends them to me, and so far I‚Äôve been recording in my city with my singer friends using my little audio interface and DAW, which isn‚Äôt much and I don‚Äôt know but the basics on the DAW. But it has been okay for my purposes up until now. I also have a producer friend, also in a different city, who wants to come to town for about ten days and go in a studio with several different singers and possibly a band, although we could also use my musician friends tracks so I guess in that case would only need the singers in the studio. My musician friend is not able to travel and so unfortunately can‚Äôt be in the studio with us. So I guess we‚Äôll either be using his tracks or starting from scratch‚Ä¶I guess neither is ideal as he is familiar with the song already, so if we pulled in other musicians there would be more of a learning curve.  Anyway I‚Äôll be leaning on my producer friend to help with all of this, but I thought I‚Äôd put this out there to see what others experiences and advice might be on something like this, as I am very much a newbie.

I have solid enough guitar and piano skills to play full sets of songs from memory and I can sing fairly well. Granted, I don't have the greatest voice, but I've seen plenty of guys as ok as I am do what I want to do. I play mostly folk/jazz/indie pop songs and some jazz standards. But in my area/city, the main style of live music places usually show is country, and I don't really play country. I'm also a non-white teenage girl; I don't really look like the typical older white country musicians who usually perform.

I've gone to open mics and I've performed in school shows, and I'm currently about to join my college's music theater department. I've wanted for a few years and I've tried to reach out to restaurants to play some gigs. I have my own amp, an electric and acoustic guitar, a mic, and a speaker for it. The problem is I don't really have any kind of professional profile. A video or two up on TikTok, but usually I send out video/mp3 files to whoever I want to convince. I'm polite and professional in conversation, but I have no website and no professional gigging experience to back me up.

Mostly I've just cold-called restaurants who I know have live music to ask if they're looking for musicians, but usually they either aren't looking, don't get back, or they hear me out but end up being unable to give me a gig. I've also contacted a local agent but they didn't get back to me after I sent them my info. I think they usually give half-hearted excuses, maybe because I'm not very good, but I genuinely think any semi-decent musician who just knows how to play enough likable songs would be able to do what I want to do. I think my problem is I just don't know how to establish a professional platform for myself. I don't know how this kind of gig industry works. I'm making this post for professional rather than skill advice. How do I get people to respond to me? What's the right method for reaching out to places for live music? Should I get an agent? How do I get an agent to hear me out? I know I should probably make a website, but what do I have to show for if I have no professional experience? Also, what's the right gear for solo gigs? Is what I have enough?

I don't want to be famous, I don't really even want to release my own music or be an artist, I just want to play local gigs and I don't know how. I don't have connections or music industry friends/family. But this is kind of my secret life dream. If I could just start playing at restaurants or coffee shops or anything, that would be enough for me. Advice would be really appreciated. Thanks.",1712448582.0

So I have a Scarlett 2i4 second gen for a while and I am looking for upgrading. I will try to explain my best while keeping it short. I have a Elektron Syntakt, a Roland SH-4D and a Akai MPC live. I also have a Arturia Keystep Pro and a Native Intruments Komplete Kontrol S61 Mk2. 

My idea is to have everything connected, through Ableton via MIDI, at any point for ease of use plus a microphone and a guitar. I was thinking about getting the Arturia Audiofuse Studio which would cover pretty much everything (inputs so I can have everything connected, 2 headphones out and MIDI connection plus the usb ports). In this way I can have everything connected to the same spot without having to fiddle with cables. However, the more I read the more I get scared of making a wrong buy mainly due to the audiofuse being usb 2.0 and the preamps not being good enough or have some noise. 

Therefore I have another option which would have to be a more long term accomplishment. I have been hearing great about the SSL 12 but it would be some what a compromise for me. The 4 extra inputs would be handy as well as the usb ports included in the Arturia. If I got the SSL 12, later on I would have to get an expansion(through ADAT possible) and maybe a good expansion to get the 8 inputs I would like to have would be the SSL PURE DRIVE QUAD (or maybe the OCTO)

I play it too, but I don't let it affect me.  I am never the person that lashes out and puts my anxiety/frustration on others almost ever.

I've gotten to a point where now things are getting serious, I'm preparing for different scenarios, getting ready to treat this as a job.  

But people around me don't really show support.  In fact, I'm usually the emotional support and pusher, I'll get people art supplies, offer to buy drums, woodworking equipment, the whole spectrum.  People like my songs I'll send them, they'll like my live playing, but I don't think they understand where I want to go.  And it's not because I haven't communicated it, it's because it's not a realistic goal to some people.  They don't see a vision/goal because it seems cartoon-ish to them.  But I am just keyed into the world differently than them, BUT I respect their perspective and their realistic views.

But I'm hiding a lot of my progress from the past year, I'm like treating it like I'm doing heroin sometimes, just trying to get a hit and hide away sometimes.  I'm in a situation of JUST getting a new job after a few months, so I've had to hide a lot of things because of course ""why are you playing music when you should be looking for a job.""  All fair, makes sense.  But it's interesting to be stuck in a scenario of progress where you know you can only rely on yourself, and you need to hide your actual goals, because people will pounce on you if you were truly honest.  Again, I believe it's fair to criticize it, but on the other hand, it also sucks a tad to be surrounded by little positive influence. ",1712347110.0

Overnight, he went from having 3K followers to a staggering 200K on Instagram and half a million on TikTok, with his Spotify garnering 10 million listeners and reaching the number 1 spot on global charts. 

I am genuinely pleased to see my friend experience this success because his songs are great. I am just frustrated and feeling hopeless because this success seemed entirely random; his song went viral without much effort or consistency on his part - he made the song, hasn't really been posting much TikToks and doesn't know much about marketing; just posted a TikTok (nothing special) and it popped off. While you may suggest it's an attestation that his success means others can do it too.. it's disheartening seeing other artists including this friend who have some other OUTSTANDING songs, market them so much, put so much effort into writing/production/marketing... and nothing happens. 

It feels like success in the music industry boils down to luck so much.... leaving us feeling demotivated and overlooked despite our efforts.

My biggest problem right now is my sound selection, which at the current time I have to spend most time on in order to sound decent. I was pretty lucky to meet some more experienced music producers who would teach me some stuff, making my learning progress faster.

Facelift is my favourite alice in chains album.

I feel that this one is similar to black sabbath, classic heavy metal. Great in every aspect, Layne was a killer apart from the bass on this one.

Where it is common for the bassists to follow the guitars, on this song, Mike follows the drum for most of the part, even the bass fills complement the drum fills. It has a damn perfect rhythm. Mike is one of the biggest inspirations and one of my favourite bassists. He has a multilayered style of playing and is a multidimensional bassists with so nany weapons in his arsenal, can play with a finger, a pick, can slap and his usage of chords and slides are godly.

Not much of a challenge for an AIC song, just memorizing the changing bass fills maybe. Figured out the tabs by isolating the bass from the mix.

Original Bassist - Mike Starr

713,Guitar resale etiquette,27,1bvu6ve,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1bvu6ve/guitar_resale_etiquette/,164,"1. Depreciation: Your guitar‚Äôs value drops by about 1/3 the moment that you purchase it and leave the store with it. You can post that SG Standard for $1200 and refuse to budge, but nobody is going to buy it from you. They‚Äôll just buy a brand new one.
2. Obscurity vs rarity: You have a model that was only manufactured for one year? Cool. That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make it rare and valuable. My 2014 SGJ is definitely obscure and hard to find. It‚Äôs still only worth about $650. I audibly laugh when I see people post them for $900 knowing that they‚Äôre not very good guitars and were available for only $500 brand new. Same goes for Airline, Kay, Harmony and either dirt cheap vintage guitars people think are worth $1,000 just because they‚Äôre old.
3. Aftermarket parts: I don‚Äôt care if you spent $6 million on parts. They‚Äôre useless in the guitar value wise. If you want money for them, take them out and sell them separately. Regardless of what you paid, nobody is going to pay you near retail value for the aftermarket parts in your guitar ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôve ruined a high end USA made guitar with unnecessary ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù.
4. Vintage: Your vintage gear is only valuable if it‚Äôs all original. If you‚Äôve painted it, changed  parts, etc it is now just a regular guitar with no special value.
5. Selling an expensive guitar with no case is like selling grenades with the pins removed.
6. Headstock repairs: Headstock repairs cut the instrument‚Äôs price in half. Your Les Paul was worth $2,000 brand new. The second you left the store with it, it was worth $1,400. The second you broke the headstock, the value dropped to $700. I don‚Äôt care if Jesus Christ himself did the headstock repair. It‚Äôs a $700 guitar.

As a general rule when selling ANYTHING, it‚Äôs almost definitely worth 20%-25% less than what you think it‚Äôs worth.

727,How to cultivate loyal fans:,0,1bw6626,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1bw6626/how_to_cultivate_loyal_fans/,7,"In today's digital music age, building a loyal fanbase is crucial for sustained success.
The primary purpose of an entertainer is to entertain their audience. If they don‚Äôt have a loyal fan base to entertain, the artist either isn‚Äôt entertaining or just hasn‚Äôt found the people who will enjoy them.

As a professional songwriter with over a decade of experience helping fellow artists navigate their careers, I‚Äôve witnessed firsthand the evolving landscape of the music industry. In this era dominated by social media and streaming platforms, success is now more about capturing and retaining audience attention, fostering genuine connections, and building a loyal fanbase.

Here are some key strategies to foster fan loyalty:

- Know Your Audience:
Invest time in understanding your fans' brand preferences, habits, motivations, values, etc Utilize analytics tools and direct feedback to gain insights into what resonates with them and tailor your approach accordingly. You should have a concrete idea of who your average fan is and what their specific interests are.

- Know Your Value: 
People engaged with content or listen to music to be entertained and validated. Know what entertains them and do it consistently to build loyalty. Being a successful artist is a happy balance between self expression and giving fans with what they want.

- Collaborate Wisely: 
Partner with influencers or fellow artists who share your audience to broaden your reach and credibility. Collaborative projects and cross-promotions can introduce your music to new fans while strengthening your connection with existing ones.

Stop looking for step-by-step guides, hacks, and quick results. Building fan loyalty is a gradual process that requires patience, content that entertains those people specially, and consist follow through. No matter what. Get curious about your ideal fans and what make them tick. Then entertain them!

Around 18 I started to love the Blues genre. My best friend introduced me to Stevie Ray Vaughan and i was hooked. So anyway, I got accepted to my music program in my university, and I just wanted to show you this little improvisation I did in their band room. I am very informal when it comes to reading music and music theory, so taking this plunge into proper music is a bit intimidating. 

I was hoping you guys could tell me what you think of my style.

Here's the first single from my upcoming LP Microcosms. Alien Transmissions is available for download \[free\] from my Bandcamp page, and as each track from the LP is released, I'll be uploading an accompanying music video I've created personally to match the track. As this record was generously funded by Arts Council England, I'll be giving away digital copies of the album for free; be sure to subscribe to my Bandcamp to recieve notifications when tracks from Microcosms are published.

Microcosms came about through a realisation I'd been living until the age of 27 with far-sightedness. In re-examing the visual world around me with a new clarity, I decided to apply the same investigation to sound; this record is a collection of electro-magnetic radio transmissions, noise and field recordings all treated through my modular synthesiser.

I want to play both for the same reason, jazz i have had an interest in saxophone ever since i was a little kid thanks to one of my classmates, but my parents never allowed me because they hate the saxophone with a passion, now i'm 23 and no longer care about what they think of my choice of instruments (as you can see from the bagpipes)

But trumpet also greatly interests me thanks to things like jazz, Chet baker, Lucky Chops.

Trumpet would be the cheaper option as we have a trumpet at home because my father played trumpet when he was in the airforce and it still works fine.

My question is whether I should be paying the other band members with what we make at shows. They've told me they just love being in the band and are doing it for fun, but I know similar bands in our area DO pay members after shows. What's the etiquette here? Should I be paying the guys?

I'm not trying to be a Scrooge. And honestly, there's no money to Scrooge over. From a financial standpoint, the band is literally just a big debt I carry. There are no profits.

I first started using ditto and it was ok, but now that i learn more and more about business side of music i am getting more and more disappointed. I feel like i got no tools on ditto and their publishing service does absolutely nothing. To top it off, they are taking too long to send music to stores and now i am less than 24 hours from my next release i still haven't got my smart link (pre save link) and it is still not reflected in my Spotify for artists daahboard.
So. Here is the question.
I have been eyeing the Music Gateway portal and i like their sync licensing and tools available to grow.
But i also have some music friends using Distrokid. 
What is your insight regarding these platforms? Any insight would be much appreciated.

* Read **Two Story Melody** blog posts
* Plan to watch **Jesse Cannon** and **Two Story Media's YouTube videos**

We're preparing to release a single a month for a while instead of an album all at once to regain online engagement. We're less focused on money funnels at the moment, though planning to do an email marketing funnel, using a free download as the incentive.

I see my peers go viral, get playlisted, get radio play and playing gigs every week. I constantly stalk their numbers and see how mine are barely existent.

I truly believe my art and music is good enough, but I lack the willpower and nerve to put myself out there enough. I have tried my best to network but due to not being a conventionally attractive girl in the industry I struggle immensely to connect on a authentic level as they are superficial. 

This is no excuse but I am very alone in the world as I only have my brother and friends (my family isn‚Äôt in my life). I have never had a stable place to call home and I long for a peace and love I lack right now feeling like a failure next to my amazing peers. I don‚Äôt know if I should keep going or accept that I don‚Äôt want to give more of myself as it‚Äôs making me unhappy as of now.

EDIT:
Thank you for all the lovely replies. This morning I started missing the fun of writing songs and remembered why I even started doing music to begin with. All the different opinions and stories you have commented reminded me that being born with a creative drive is something beautiful, and regardless the outcome it‚Äôs a talent we should celebrate wether it‚Äôs alone in the rehearsal room or in front of a big crowd.

I am kinda having a crisis and I would like to refund myself and start enjoying doing stuff again instead of just consuming content, and I miss just playing music. 

However I just feel tired and just do other stuff that is menial and low effort. I feel like I can't find the energy to do anything meaningful (which is another issue by itself but related to my want to play again.)

I am also considering what I should play. I don't have a piano or keyboard anymore, my violin was a rental. I just have the guitar now. Idk if I should play a new instrument or just do one that I have played before.

So I guess I have a few questions. How do you keep yourself motivated to play an instrument? And how did you choose what instrument you wanted to play? ",1712113659.0

There's one local promoter who puts on free shows (with several acts on the bill) every week at a bar, plus he does a few 'weekenders' during the year, with lots of bands/duos/soloists performing across a couple of days. I would say it's like a hobby/obsession for him that he doesn't seek to profit from.

Lots of musicians like him and appreciate his contribution to keeping the local scene alive. However, Recently I've started to feel pissed off that he holds such a monopoly over local music, to the extent that it's very hard to get a paid gig - because why would people pay when there's free live music every week? 

I saw him ranting on social media about our city's one dedicated live venue where bands play ticketed shows, like he resents the fact that musicians want to get paid - and I am keen to distance myself from this. I believe he thinks we're friends and - although I am grateful for the musical opportunities - he has overshared stuff with me before that I wasn't comfortable with.

In the past I have turned down a slot on another local promoter's radio show because it's someone he has a rivalry with and I wanted to stay on the free promoter's good side. Now I'm returning to local live performance and I want to make it clear that I am a professional and not interested in this guys petty personal beefs if it disadvantages my exposure.

Me: worked many years as house sound board operator for Rodeo, truck audio A1 for broadcast, Location sound and will God Willing make it to my A2 gigs this summer. It's mostly been TV broadcasting, but currently working on a Commercial Music degree and learning DANTE, Pro Tools, also sight reading for guitar, bass, piano, Classical Guitar. (Been playing since I was 13, currently 43, just never learned sight reading)

Just burnt out on doing just TV/film for the past 20 years, I feel dead creatively, my work is empty and boring,  it's just not as cool as working/being around music. Would much rather hear a cool band, mix a cool record or rock a cool guitar riff than film some talking head/CEO or do audio for a sports game. I actually had a punk radio show on AMP and made some money for a while doing that, II have lived it, breathed it and I have an in-depth knowledge. Would love to be a performer on stage. I like singing, playing guitar, bass, I love to rock. But how realistic is that?? It seems that the sound engineers, recording, mastering engineers and such make much better pay than musicians. I mean, how many top bands are there? Most local bands don't make any money (when I did it in my 20's we played for free or open mic nights) Of course, I'm a LOT better now because I'm taking proper music classes, but still, I heard the chances of making a living playing music playing on big states/concerts are like less than 1% or something like that?

The song is sonically peacefully whole, while simultaneously driving and energizing. From the get, clean guitar lines oscillate and work together until the snare comes pushing the rhythm ahead into a chorus that reflects times changing and a potentially bleak or optimistic future. This newest single from Joytrip is one that rewards repeat listens and pairs wonderfully with brisk walks by water, driving 4+ hours in the Midwest and horizontal contemplation.

Listen and share! Joytrip had shows in the Midwest leading up to a run of shows in Colorado (Denver, Ft. Collins, Golden, Evergreen).

I'm getting back out there with some covers (vocal's) and variations of stuff as well as playing my horns. I doubt there is a complete answer to my needs, but here they are:  


1. Lead / chord sheet organization, key changes, etc. I have downloaded OnSong but I just don't get the hype. I'm not subbing to other sources and paying for chord sheets. I can do the chords in a few minutes just listening to the songs. But I do want to be able to use the iPad and change the keys.
2. Score, Piano music. I would also like the above functionality for piano music. If possible.
3. Original and produced backing tracks. I want to use said iPad for backing tracks for when I play sax and sing some contemporary covers. I prefer an organized app, not a playlist someplace on spotify or apple music.
4. Ultimately, I'd also like VIDEO and LYRIC presentation from the same device simultaneously for sing along and karaoke options.

We get to jamming and he said if i wasnt doing anything next saturday his band needed a drummer. 
Me him and the rest of the band(lead singer that, at the time, was on cruches and a whimsical bass player) practiced probably a couple hours in total and we got 3 hours of material down before the gig. It was an all day thing, it was a restaurant that had good outdoor seating just in time for COVID. One of my favorite times I've ever performed.
My question comes from the events follow after this kick ass gig.
We had about 5 or 6 performances after this but we kinda fizzled out and everyone started doing their own thing musically. I'm still great friends with all of them, just don't have the time to jam together like we used to.

I think I‚Äôd rather find a producer, but how would I go about that? Do you think I should venture producing on my own more or focus on finding someone who already has the skill and complete the vision that I have already here on paper?

I should also note that I have a full time 9-5 job, so having the time/energy to embark on this producing journey is also what discourages me to even attempt all of this because it‚Äôs not something you can learn overnight.

""Yeah man! People will love it!""
I feel just winging it is more the house party scene.
I tell him we need to learn structure, proper timing, etc. and one of the best ways is to learn covers...which he has a hard time accepting.
I'm all for just making unstructured swirling sounds but I think artists of all facets through time and they certainly studied the masters seriously. The Renaissance painters used to literally copy master paintings. Some writers have copied word for word their heroes if only just to ""feel"" it. And of course Beatles and Dylan and many many others started mainly doing covers.

I know my path is to become an artist, i've always needed to express myself constantly and i'm a musician because i don't know anything else.

I am four semesters into a university music degree that would take me two more semesters to finish. 

I feel that I‚Äôve learned most of what I came to learn (theory and ear training, especially the fundamentals since I am mostly interested in pop music) and am not really enjoying myself anymore. 

I have little interest in analyzing any more classical pieces as I am not a classical musician and do not play piano nearly well enough to even perform any of the pieces we are analyzing in theory class at this point. I enjoy playing piano (not my main instrument) and plan to keep working on my piano playing, just feel that what I‚Äôm being asked to do theoretically is so far ahead of my playing ability that I see little value in it at this point. 

The ear training class has moved into the realm of atonal music and I am equally uninterested in that. I plan to keep working on my ear regardless, however, as I realize how important it is for what I want to do.  

As far as music history, I feel that I‚Äòd rather read books about it than take classes where I need to write papers and analyze old pieces which I am not really interested in.  

I currently make most of my income from performing music/gigging and none of the music I play (mostly pop/rock) has much to do with what we do in school, where it‚Äôs just classical and jazz. I‚Äòm primarily a drummer, by the way. 

I also record/produce music and hope to grow that into a bigger stream of income over the next few years. I do not feel that the music program I am in directly helps me do that either. Theory and ear training are obviously super important for that but I feel that it‚Äôs mostly the fundamentals that are crucial, as most popular music tends to be rather simple in terms of harmony, etc. 

What do you guys think‚Ä¶should I stick it out for two more semesters after this one or do I call it quits after this semester? 

How important is getting the degree/piece of paper?

Oh by the way, I already have a Bachelor‚Äòs degree so this would be a second one, albeit one in music, which I suppose could be a requirement for getting a teaching job in music. I don‚Äôt necessarily see myself teaching unless I need the money, however.

Turns out that wasn't enough. It was one of the loudest shows I¬¥ve ever been to and next day, tinnius was insanely loud. Of cause, it didn't stay that loud, but also never completly went away. Also, it seems like I have slight hearing loss on my right side. A slight dip at the higher frequencies, but nothing that affects my life right now.

The impact on my mental health has been mixed....Luckily, most of the time, if I stay busy and there is background noise, I dont notice it at all or not that much. But every few weeks, there come a few days, where I completly fixate on it and start to become depresses, anxious and worried. Affects my ability to sleep and concentrate....what if it will get worse? Stuff like that.



At first I was very afraid of going to concerts, but got some custom molded earplugs from a professional store with the maximum filter.

I¬¥ve been hesitant at first cause I was very afraid of making the tinnitus worse, but since 2020 I¬¥ve been to like 2 concerts and a few times clubbing. Luckily, these plugs offered enough protection and afterwards I didnt have the feeling my tinnitus got worse.



Now, the reason why I am actually texting this. I started a metal band with some friends (I play guitar) and we already wrote a good amount of songs. But I kind of start to get worried, that I will permanently fuck up my ears even more and may and up at a point, where my tinnitus becomes unbearable.

Normally you could argue like ""okay, the band plays around 100-105dB. The earplugs reduce the noise exposure by 20-30 dB to around 70-90 dB. The time for safe listening of 90 dB, which would be the most pessemistic scenario, would be 4 hours. So probaly I¬¥d be fine if we play one gig per week.

But since my ears already took some permanent damage and hearing damage is cumulative, I am afraid my hearing might be more prone for further damage compared to normal people.

I¬¥m in a tough spot right now, since I feel like I have to make a decision between following my dream of playing in a metal band and risking potentially life ruining tinnitus, or giving up on it, in order to avoid this risk.

I¬¥ll definetly talk with an ENT and audiologist about it, but I assume some of you may had such kind of thoughts or experiences with the topic, that might help be guide my decision.



If you read on r/tinnitus....some people say they still go to shows etc, because they feel safe when using earplugs. But others made their tinnitus permenantly worse and advice against any kind of super loud environment. It¬¥s really depressing to read some of these storys.

So, I¬¥d be thankfull for any insight you could share on the topic.

Thanks in advance and all the best to you.

I have a softer voice & although I can project, I lose vocal dynamics when I'm fixated on staying loud. The other night at a show I even had my drummer put moongels on his cymbals to mitigate the higher frequencies - still, the same issue! I'm not sure how much of this is a mixing issue, as I always try to coordinate with the sound person to prioritize my vocal levels. 

Any tips for how I can proceed? Do I ask my drummer to play softer (he's super adaptable & would do it if I asked but it also feels sacrilege to ask a drummer to do that)? Do I try in-ears again (which I ditched because the last time I wore them, I couldn't even hear my own voice)? Do I pick vocal lessons back up to improve my technique / stamina / power?

It‚Äôs great when I‚Äôm practicing on my midi keyboard, however I also want to improve my rhythmic accuracy on my guitars and on my pipe organ, which I can‚Äôt plug into with a midi cable.

&#x200B;

The definition of music producer has changed much over the past 30 years. Most literature I have found doesn't seem to be able to define what a producer is objectively. In the effort to understand the roles of a producer, a co-writer, and a mixer, I present you with 2 scenarios. 

&#x200B;

Scenario 1:

&#x200B;

Bob writes and records several songs. Bob has written complete songs with all lyrical content, vocal and music melodies, and chord progressions. He has recorded several guitars, bass, layered vocals, and composed the midi drums. Afterwards, he sends the songs to be mixed by Joe. 

&#x200B;

Joe receives Bob's stems and mixes them for the final product. In addition to adjusting volume and EQ levels, adding reverb and other effects, using pitch correction, etc., Joe also:

\- adds some synth bass on a few tracks

\- alters some drum beats

\- adds percussion and brass section on a track

\- adds background effects like swells, bass drops, other effects to add ambience

\- double's up a chorus

\- stops the music on certain sections to make a vocal line stand out

\- extends or reduces the length of a bridge, outro, or intro

&#x200B;

All of these creative changes are approved by Bob. 

&#x200B;

What Joe does NOT do:

\- add new chord progressions

\- add new melodies

\- add new lyrics

\- make any changes without the approval and collaboration of Bob

&#x200B;

What is Joe's role in this scenario? Is he operating only as a mixer? Or is he a co-writer and/or producer as well?

&#x200B;

Scenario 2:

&#x200B;

Mary has written several parts of songs on one instrument. She has chord progressions for verses, choruses, bridges, lyrics, vocal melodies. However she has trouble putting them into a final arrangement, and is unsure of which parts fit together and belong together in a song. She asks Sue for her help in this process. 

&#x200B;

Sue listens to all of Mary's parts. Sue accompanies her on another instrument during the process of arranging the pieces. Sue performs the following functions:

\- determines which chord progressions and lyrics should serve as verse, chorus, and bridge

\- adds a piano or guitar lead line over a few choruses and an intro

\- takes a verse from another intended song and turns it into a bridge for a different song

\- turns a verse from one song into a chorus for another song

\- changes a guitar strumming section into picking instead

\- changes a guitar strumming chord progression into an arpeggiating piano piece (same chord progression)

\- adds a few buildups for bridge sections or last choruses (using same chord progressions)

\- records a demo with Mary and adds drums, piano, bass, and lead guitar 

\- asks Mary to sing an octave higher or lower for a certain section

\- adds vocal harmonies to several sections

\- adds back-up vocal ""oohs and ahhs""

&#x200B;

What Sue does NOT do:

\- add new chord progressions

\- add new lyrics

\- add new lead vocal melodies

\- make any changes without the approval and collaboration of Mary

&#x200B;

What is Sue's role in this scenario? Is she an arranger, producer, co-writer? None of the above? All of the above?

&#x200B;

I'm looking for the most objective, by-the-book answer - as if we were sitting down with a music business attorney - what would he/she say?

&#x200B;

Please only respond if you have performed similar roles to the above in the creation of recorded and released songs.

920,Deep Purple - Space Truckin' Bass Cover,1,1bqnmrm,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1bqnmrm/deep_purple_space_truckin_bass_cover/,0,"This week, one of my favourite Deep Purple songs. Enjoyed covering this one to the fullest, however it needed a month worth of practice. Plus you never go wrong with Ritchie Blackmore worship, there is a lot to gain. One of the bands where I praise the guitarist more than the bassist, though I love Roger Glover quite a lot as well, but Ritchie is god. 

All the musicians are perfect on the song, the drums are great, the drum solo is an underrated one. I enjoy the drumming of Ian Paice, vocals are awesome too. For me, a song way ahead of its time. 

Roger follows the guitars on this quite a bit on this one, except on the bridge. The song flows throughout the body of the bass, like riding or truckin' through the space. Lot of fluctuations, highs and lows, a ride every bassist covering this one would enjoy for sure, I enjoyed it more than I usually enjoy. The bass solo is pretty simple, but precise. The rhythm Roger carries on this one is very godly,  there are parts where the bass goes on its own and the drums goes separately, for example before the bass solo, it can be tough and at the same time good for building your own rhythm.

This one was a challenge, played along all the strings and across the fretboard, with fast switches.  Roger used a lot of accents in his playing. The rhythm of the song can get confusing for new musicians and more than any other thing, the mini bass solo in the bridge requires speed and precision. So a great one to practice and step up the playing. 

Genre - Heavy Metal / Space rock
Original Bassist - Roger Glover
From the album 'Machine Head'

Tell me if it would be something you would buy for $29.99 - $34.99. 

Our genre lies somewhere within rock, pop rock, and alternative; compare us to some kind of combination of The Black Keys, Jet, and Rob Gallow, all with some classic rock influences. 

Both designs are to be placed on the front of black t-shirts. Any advice on companies, material, print size, shirt sizing amounts, and anything else would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, in advance :)",1711700106.0

Oh and he has my same first name name and our last names start the same lol. It's like whenever I'm near him I feel like he's a better musician, piano player, and i just need to give up. Like if I know people around my circle need a piano player, they'll call him and not think of me. I know this is weird but idk i cant hell it (im really insecure overall).
Once I saw him live and seeing everyone clap for him and say ""wow he's so talented, amazing, one of the best"" really brought me down, like ""hey, that couzkd be me and it isn't"". The name thing is also kinda weird for me cuz whenever someone says my name they're mostly talking about him and i feel weird.
I feel like whenever i see his stories playing  recording, and whatever bring me down when im not doing anything. 
I'll have to add that I dont want to work with all the same people that he does because i also have my contacts and I dont like some of the people he knows because of personal reasons, but  I also know that not geeting to know them or contacting them won't be the smartest.

Feel free to ask anything or tell me anything you want. 

If you want to listen to what I made: [https://www.youtube.com/@flitfall](https://www.youtube.com/@flitfall) If you‚Äôre going to listen to my songs, skip ahead of the bad intros and ignore Becoming Crazy, I only made that song to learn how to use Garageband. Not necessarily asking for feedback or trying to promote.

There is something that has been bothering me lately. I make unique electronic instrumentals with just the default instruments and effects Garageband on a mobile device(not the problem). I understand my songs have bad mixing, unprofessional instruments, awful intros, awful SEO, and repeat the same thing for too long, but I still liked them, and so did my friends. I though A Distant Place was absolutely beautiful and that The Mirror had a lot of energy when I first released them. While I‚Äòm not too serious about music, there is one thing that bothers me: after one year, I have only gotten worse!

A few years ago, before I had an interest in making music, I could sit down for 5 minutes and compose an amazing song in my head. All of the times I did that, I never forgot what I made and I loved it. Unfortunately, I only did this a few times, and these songs require vocals and specific instruments, so the closest thing I was able to make to one of these songs was Heartstripped.

The first time I decided to use Garageband, I was amazed at how easily I could compose beautiful melodies and songs without any prior experience. Those melodies weren‚Äôt amazing, but I could totally see room for improvement. Up until Encryptia, making these songs that I wanted to post came so easily. The real first song I made and posted on youtube was Dimensions, and despite the bad mixing and over-repetitive structure, I thought it was beautiful. I was able to listen to Futures, my 2nd song multiple times, all the way through, and I never got bored of it. A Distant Place is probably my favorite song of mine, although it was a symbolic form of self-expression for the emotions I‚Äôve been going through at that time. I actually once believed that, with a few finishing touches, Encryptia or A Distant Place could be on par with 647 by Instupendo. After releasing Futures, so many great melodies and songs started popping into my head at random times of the day.

Unfortunately, the best ones only came when I couldn‚Äôt record them. There was just one problem with that: Every time I started a new project, I was quickly bored by what I made. Whether I improvised or tried to make something I recorded, I either had no way to finish it without vocals, with my current tools, or, most often, it just sounded super boring no matter what I did. I have literally hundreds of unfinished songs, and as time went on, those unfinished songs got worse and worse. The melodies that popped into my head at random times got worse and worse. Every aspect of my music-production has gotten worse. Often, it was impossible for me to finish a song because, no matter how I changed it, I just didn‚Äôt have the desire to finish it because it was so boring. It‚Äôs annoying having LITERALLY 5 FLUKES IN A ROW just to find out you will never be able to make songs better than those.

Is this a normal thing for many artists to go through? I‚Äôve seen multiple times online that these experiences happen sometimes, but my experience just seems so extreme and unnatural that the only conclusion I can come to is that, if you compared the musical potential of everyone on Earth, I would be in the bottom 10%. Like, 1 year, 50 views, no good songs? How? Although my intros are terrible and my songs(mixing, instruments, and thumbnail) are too unprofessional for any random person to take it seriously, a truly good song should get at least 200 views and 5 likes. If every song by the Weeknd was made as an instrumental with bad mixing, bad intros, awful SEO, and unprofessional instruments like my songs, would they still be significantly more popular than my songs? Just listen to any song by Temporex and hear how absolutely beautiful it is compared to my music which lies in the 50-100 view abyss. Temporex isn‚Äôt a rich pop star who uses tons of expensive effects and instruments, he‚Äôs a teenager who made something beautiful with what he had. I know he‚Äôs talented, but I just can‚Äôt do the same.",1711687352.0

931,Is it polite to ask local band for their arrangements?,13,1bpwmsy,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1bpwmsy/is_it_polite_to_ask_local_band_for_their/,15,"Hello musicians. 

I have a bit shy question. 

I really like one local band, it is swing-jazz trio, three beautiful talented ladies playing violin, ukulele, guitar and singing 1920s-1940s music. It is their side hustle, primarily working as professional singers at biggest (and only) swing orchestra in capital city.

Some of songs from that era are composed by Slovak composers (or orchestra, or singer-songwriters) and it is impossible to find music sheets for that, especially for ukulele. It is not like ""Yes sir that's my baby"" or ""It's only Paper Moon"" which is virtually everywhere. I looked in music shops, asked studied musicologists, asked teachers, crawled internet, nope, no luck at all. 

I really want to play and sing some of that by myself or with kids but I can not play them as (theoretically) precise as they. Yes, most of music of that era is II-V-I but all those voicings are making it just right. 

I saw them live, they have some papers in front of them, they read some music while playing...  Is it polite to write them and asked them for arrangement? I would gladly buy them, maybe some CDs, merch.... I am spoiled by youtubers who offer their sheets to buy online (or on patreon).

a simple disclaimer: I have no intention making money with music or be some competition or steal from them. It's their job, for me it is only a sweet hobby at home.

How would you react if I wrote that request to you?

And I‚Äôm looking at what could be next for my music ‚Äúcareer.‚Äù I‚Äôve been the lessons for nearly two years weekly and have much improved. I‚Äôm 28 and I work for the FAA controlling air traffic, and my work schedule is rotating but has regular days off. And my usual work day has around 4 hours of break time that I can do whatever I wish. I either go to the gym in the facility where I work, read a book, or play the cello. I had a Yamaha SVC210 I would bring to work that unfortunately was stolen in a break in. But playing music on my breaks always felt like my favorite use of my time. 

My first and most important question Is music school possible for me? I ask about schooling specifically I have such a huge urge to learn and be immersed in a musical environment. I‚Äôm done training at my job and my career with the FAA is essentially a coast from here on out if I wish. I could do details here and there but there‚Äôs nothing quite like another mountain to climb like pursuing the cello. 

The school in question is the University of Puget Sound since I live in the Seattle area.

We booked our first gig at a venue that is held by our singer's friends (it's not a musical venue, but we will play our solo show there). 

A week after booking this date I get a phone call from a close friend whom I don't get to see often, inviting me to a birthday party. He lives in a different city. 

SINCE the situation is as follows: 

* This is our first gig basically for friends
* Venue is free almost every weekend, so moving is not a problem
* Currently our band is not commercial at all 

I thought I would ask my band to move this gig to another weekend. There's a lot of background personal info why going to this bday is important for me, but yeah. Long story short - they won't move it. Reason - they just don't want to do it. 

I am really invested in this band, I write riffs and am genuinely passionate about creating music. However this situation really pissed me off. I DO UNDERSTAND that initially, I am at wrong here and I am asking people to make up for my poor planning. BUT I genuinely don't get why the heck is this a problem to move this show, since there is no LEGIT reason for not doing it. 

Now I am a bit confused why my personal relationships should get affected by something that is supposed to be done for pleasure - I'm afraid that will create tension within a band to a point of me not being able to enjoy it anymore.

I'm getting alot of love in my hometown. hundreds of shares and thousands of views on my music videos, and posts, and just broke 1500 streams on Spotify with 88 Playlist adds. I want to know what is working for you!! I'm happy to share my experience and process and what had worked for me. I'm real big on Positivity and teamwork and want to watch everyone in my network grow and find success. My goal is to get on more Spotify playlists, collaborate with other artists. and just be heard and felt. Music is my passion and I use it as a tool to spread love, inspiration, and entertainment. Here's what's worked for me so far and what hasn't.
I started promoting 4 months ago, 1 month before my first single release. I made short videos and pictures with professionally taken photos and preview audio of my music then posted different content twice a week on Facebook, tiktok, Instagram, Twitter, tumbler, pinterest, snapchat, linked in, SoundCloud, bandlab, and YouTube. Then I distributed 3 singles every 3 weeks on every major platform including Spotify, apple, Amazon, deezer... ect...
I then shot and released 3 music videos, one for each single and paid $1500 for ads on Facebook, ig, tik tok, and YouTube. The ads got around 250,000 views, 7,000 new followers and a lot of love. I also spent $300 on Submithub submitting to playlist curators. About 120 of the 150 submissions were denied for different songs. 40 of then were accepted and I got added to 25 playlists, 5 blogs, 5 radio stations, and 5 haven't been shared yet. Not as good as I was expecting but still something. I also searched the emails of 200 Spotify curators and send emailed the requesting to be added to thier playlists with short and sweet descriptions of the songs and links to the music. Only about 20 of them responded and 18 of them wanted me to pay $20 - $50 for playlisting. 2 of them tried to get my credit card info to scam me lol. I've seen alot of paid playlisting is done with fake bots and didn't want to use them and get my Spotify banned. So emails were a bust. 
 I just released my debut full album 2 days ago with 11 songs and not sure what else to do to promote it then what I'm currently doing. I've sold  28 CDs and 4 Vinyls record in the first 2 days and got a out 600 plays on Spotify. 
And yes I know these are decent results, and many will say to keep pushing and it'll work out. And I agree, but after putting my heart and soul into this project, I just want to make sure there's nothing I'm missing and I'm doing everything I can. I'm also not sure how to get played on radio stations so that would helpful too. I've reached out to DJs with no responses. Any advice is appreciated. Much love ‚ô•Ô∏èü§òüé∂",1711682471.0

""Project""...Am I being petty?",63,1bp8icy,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1bp8icy/old_friend_starting_ai_projectam_i_being_petty/,173,"An old friend I've known for a long time (we used to be much closer) has just started experimenting/creating music with A.I. Music Generators. He's not a musician at all - he can come up with some decent melodies sometimes vocally, but can't sing or play an instrument to save his life. He knows I've personally been writing and performing music seriously for the last 20+ years - I'm not even that great at it, but I've worked hard, and I love music as a release and a hangout with my band members.

I get it, this A.I. stuff is going to be part of our world for the forseeable future, so do what makes you happy in your own home. The problem I have is, he's sending me (bragging about) all of these A.I. songs via DM and I don't know how to respond. I'm kinda just like, ""Cool man, technology is pretty neat"", and leave it at that, pretty much ignore the rest of his messages rambling about how hard he worked on these songs of his. He's a really insecure dude, so saying something shitty to him would probably set him off bigtime.

Look, the songs are just horrible, as you could probably understand. Not even that it's not my style of music, but just has that lifeless, robotic, generic sound. He plans on releasing dozens of these songs ASAP.  I'm still OK with this, I can ignore him for the most part.

Now he's turning this into a whole ""project"". He has new artwork, press releases, and even merch...all from A.I. Generators. Not a single ounce of effort other than pressing a few keystrokes. He's on top of the world in his mind making this fake music and blasting it all over his socials as the next big thing that's going to revolutionize the music industry. I could post some of the PR, it would make you gag. People are lifting him up saying how proud they are of him and his brilliant efforts (non-musicians, I'm sure).  My friends and I are sitting here like, hmmmm, really?

Am I being petty about this? Should I even care? I'm not losing sleep over it, but I don't know how to gently let him know that it's pretty damn annoying that I'm out here creating multiple times a week and he's pumping this garbage out with the click of a button. I'll probably just let it fizzle out, though.

Maybe I just needed to air it out and see if anyone here is dealing with a similar thing in their world.

EDIT: Thanks for all the great suggestions and experiences.I've gotten a handful of requests to hear the A.I. songs. I figured at this point it would be OK to upload the songs anonymously to a public Dropbox and Google link if you're curious and want to hear what these sound like. (I'm kinda new to Reddit, so I don't know of there's a better file server I should use).

It's a bunch of songs in one file so you'll have to skip around. You'll get the idea. Obviously some quality loss from downloading from Youtube to MP3, etc.

953,Why you should always eat the mic!,28,1bpc6bz,musicians,https://i.redd.it/6cysvpbrsxqc1.jpeg,15,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm a pro FOH sound engineer. I work for a couple national touring acts and many local venues that host pro acts. I‚Äôve mixed a couple thousand shows so far in my life. I‚Äôve come to this sub to set the record straight on something I see a lot on Reddit about mic technique.

One of the prevailing schools of thought is that a singer should ‚Äúwork the mic,‚Äù meaning they should move closer when singing softer and further away when louder.  This technique arose in an era of woefully underpowered and unwieldy PA systems susceptible to distortion and feedback. This technique made perfect sense for the time. 

These days, with modern PAs and digital processing, ‚Äúworking the mic‚Äù has become an antiquated technique for the majority of performers, and actually creates a very significant problem.

When a singer sings louder, the tonal balance almost always becomes brighter, with more upper midrange harmonics coming through. When a singer sings softer, there are less upper harmonics coming through.

The proximity effect of cardioid mics means that the closer you are, the more low and low mid frequencies are present. Let‚Äôs call them fundamental frequencies.

One of the main goals of the FOH engineer is to preserve a tonal balance between the fundamental frequencies of the voice and the upper harmonics.

The problem with working a mic like this is that when a singer is singing soft AND super close, the fundamental frequencies are so overweighted that the engineer will have to drastically cut those frequencies to achieve tonal balance.  Then when the singer sings loud and far away from the mic, the tonal balance at the microphone changes DRASTICALLY in favor of the upper harmonics, with very little fundamental frequencies, requiring the opposite sort of EQ curve.

Such a phenomenon can be solved to some degree via use of multiband dynamics processing, but as with any dynamics processing, the harder you work it, the less gain before feedback you have.  A singer being off the mic more than an inch or two also further reduces gain before feedback.  The combination of these factors reduces the effectiveness of MB comp or dynamic EQ to the point that it only becomes a viable solution on the nicest most modern PAs with the highest gain before feedback (typically outdoors).

However, eating the mic consistently increases gain before feedback enough to offset the loss from heavy handed dynamics processing, allowing an appropriate tonal balance to be achieved consistently, regardless of the volume of the singer.

I should note that the ‚Äúwork the mic‚Äù technique can, at times, be used effectively.  If the artist has a very low stage volume (like piano and jazz vocalist, with very talented and experienced performers), it can be used subtly for emphasis on certain phrases, etc. There are always exceptions to the rule, but the VAST majority of performers (even pros) who do it, overwork the mic quite a bit.

In live sound, the entire game is getting soft things loud enough. If you take away 50-75% of your possible input volume by singing off mic, it‚Äôs just a losing game.  I‚Äôve attached a graph that illustrates the inverse square law of sound. You can see that the volume lost in those first few inches away from the mic is immense. I‚Äôm inclined to think that when people work the mic, they assume that the volume into the mic has a linear relationship to the distance the mic is away from them, when in reality that relationship is logarithmic.

In ear monitoring can further exacerbate these problems by giving the singer a false sense of their own volume input into the mic.

I just mixed a show last night where the singer for the opening band was mic shy and the whole mix sounded notably worse than the headliner (who ate the mic all night). I basically could only put the kick drum and vocal in the PA for the opener because even after intense ringing out the room and getting the vocal mic ear-splittingly loud, the vocal was still barely audible over the stage sound.   Shame, because the band was really good, and if the singer just sang into the goddamn mic, it would‚Äôve been great!

TLDR:  the majority of the time, by singing off mic or overworking the mic, you take away all of the engineer‚Äôs tools and they are forced to try to balance the mix by turning everything else down, much to everyone‚Äôs chagrin.  

Almost everyone who works the mic overworks it and would be better off just eating the mic, assuming the mix is in the hands of a competent engineer. ",1711571479.0

And honestly it's absolutely fucking terrifying to release. I myself don't think that it's the absolute best song that I could've made, but I really wanted to release it, to test waters. When I was a kid I went to music school, always was shy, sang very quietly and non of my other teachers pushed me to get out of my comfort zone. My mom also once told me that I will never be able to have a music career. My friend made fun of me cause I was singing too much, said that I'm not as good as I think I am. And I never thought I was... my first ever boyfriend used to tell me to not sing low, cause I sound like a boy if I do. And today I had person comment on my song teaser, that I should quit ASAP. My current friends absolutely support me now, and even my parents do, mom too. Some try to push me a little so that I post more of myself singing, but all the words from my childhood are so stuck in my head that I just can't seem to shake the feeling that my friends and family are just being nice and that I'll be a laughing stock if I continue to do anything music related. There's days when I think I can do this, and day's where I literally can't listen to my own voice at all. So how do I really know if I suck or not? ",1711573076.0

Two of my other band members also caught the same thing (we're a 4 piece band).

The next day, we found an act that was able to cover and emailed the venue, however, they haven't responded to us at all and we're still on the bill.

As I said, it's a smaller show on a Thursday night at 10:00, we were only expecting to bring around 10-15 people max. We've performed there before, everything went well, and we've maintained a good correspondence with the booker there.

I understand how much of an inconvenience this can be for the venue, which I why I got a replacement. I'm worried they won't book us again because of this. Did I do anything wrong and is there anything else I should do?

987,Seeking Advice: Should I Audition for The Voice Australia as a Metal Vocalist?,1,1boypkv,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1boypkv/seeking_advice_should_i_audition_for_the_voice/,2,"Hey everyone,

I've been grappling with a dilemma lately and I could really use some advice from fellow musicians or anyone familiar with the music industry, particularly when it comes to reality TV singing competitions like The Voice Australia.

Let me give you a bit of background: I've been a performer for as long as I can remember, with singing being my primary passion. I've always leaned towards heavy metal, drawing a lot of inspiration from Oli Sykes, the lead vocalist of Bring Me The Horizon. My vocal style is heavily influenced by his, involving false chords, screams, and growls. Suffice to say, I love belting out those intense metal tunes.

Now, here's the thing: I've been urged by friends and family to audition for The Voice Australia. They seem to think my voice could really make an impact on the show. But here's my hesitation - the majority of contestants on The Voice seem to lean towards mainstream pop, and while I respect that genre, it's just not where my heart lies.

I've also heard that the show is heavily scripted in terms of song choice and wardrobe, and contestants don't even get to choose their audition pieces. This has me worried because I can't imagine being comfortable singing a pop song that doesn't resonate with me, or worse, one I've never even heard before.

I've noticed that in European versions of The Voice, there seem to be more opportunities for rock and metal vocalists, but I'm specifically interested in the Australian edition.

So, here's where I turn to you, Reddit community. Have any of you been on The Voice or have insights into how it operates behind the scenes? Is it worth it for someone like me to audition, knowing my vocal style isn't typical for the show? And if you've been in a similar position, how did you navigate it?

I'm open to any advice, suggestions, or personal experiences you can share. Thanks in advance for your help!",1711535866.0

As the question above says, how do you all record decent audio. I don't have a great phone so audio through it is fine but not great and I'm of the mind set that quality stuff gets you a lot further. I'm looking for something captures voice and guitar well. 

Any ideas? ",1711533493.0
989,Hard to stick to one genre?,21,1bod011,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1bod011/hard_to_stick_to_one_genre/,32,"Any of you find yourself bouncing around genre wise?

Been making music for a few years and my mind doesn't seem to wanna stick to any one genre.

In the past few months I've gone from synthwave to future garage to ambient. Admittingly if I had another hit song I'm sure got pursue me to stay more in my lane.  My last popular song was from maybe around 2 and 3 years ago, IE- 100k+ streams.

990,What do you do if you‚Äôre performing live and feel out of control during a song ,9,1boi1sd,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1boi1sd/what_do_you_do_if_youre_performing_live_and_feel/,17,"I‚Äôve been performing live for over a year now but I always fear feeling out of control (I perform solo) as it has happened to me a few times and it‚Äôs a horrible feeling. I‚Äôm unsure if I should:

A) stop the song and either start again or just go back a line.

Or 

B) carry on and hope I can gain control again 

I understand that sometimes the audience don‚Äôt even notice this (if it‚Äôs minor) but I just wanted some advice on what to do in this situation.
Of course if it‚Äôs a gig you might start the song again (depending on how far you are through it) but at an open mic I can understand that it might be a bit annoying if you start a song all over again. ",1711484664.0
