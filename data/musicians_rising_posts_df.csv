1,Goodbye To An Era (Genre Change),9,1cewozy,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1cewozy/goodbye_to_an_era_genre_change/,4,"Oh God - I hope none of my band mates find this post.

I‚Äôm the over expressive talker of the band and we‚Äôve been best friends forever. We are friends before musicians in my heart. Our goal, years ago is to get in a room and create original music and record it. We have accomplished that. We are not a band trying to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù but who put the work in for us and with the tolerability of our friends and families.

I‚Äôve been building to have the conversation with the dudes for awhile and it happened today‚Ä¶.

We have buried the corpse. We are no longer a metal band. I‚Äôm so conflicted.

We always had songs that didn‚Äôt fit and always wanted to play rock but, today was the day.

We enjoy, as a group experimenting and pushing ourselves outside of a genre to come up with a result. Now - I‚Äôm kind of free - and I feel a little sick inside. I have a safety valve, a wheel house, and I can kind of do things a touch differently.

But‚Ä¶it‚Äôs scary. ",1714274608.0

It is convenient since I always have my phone on me, but I'm actually going back to the pen and paper for two reasons. One, it just feels very impersonal when I read my lyrics later on the phone or tablet. Two, I often would type a lyric on the phone and then completely forget about it by the time I got home. I'll remember a piece of paper, and then I'll set it on my piano when I get home, so I'll see it and remember to work on it when I have time. I still use my phone when I just don't have other options, but when possible, I'll use pen and paper.

I'm such a coward about it. I hate eyes on me in any setting. I can play well when I'm alone, but as soon as I have an audience I start screwing up when playing anything that's not simple. Even if I write something cool and tell my wife to come hear it I'll screw it up every single time once she is present, and then when she leaves I'll get it right again. I was in a few bands as a teen and luckily could play in front of the few friends we would occasionally bring to practices, but I was terrified to get on stage when the time came. I was gonna suck it up and deal with it of course because It would have been more embarrassing to tell my friends I was scared, but fortunately we never made it that far so I never had to.

I've recently been getting into singing more, and my buddy and I have been producing some songs with me doing vocals instead of guitar. I kind of dig it and I think I like the idea of singing. But there's even more expectation for a stage presence as a singer because now you're talking to the crowd and people are paying more attention to you, at least as a guitarist I could just hang off to the side and do my thing. We're not even a band, so there's no plan to play any shows anytime soon. But last night I went to a show, and idk it just seemed so easy.  All these casual people just got on stage, did their thing, had fun, and got offstage. I kept just feeling disappointed that I've let so much time go by and haven't just done it yet.

I'm hoping to hear some of your first show nerve stories and how it went / how you felt afterwards to hopefully help me realize I can do it. So let's hear them!",1714165293.0

21,ISO Talented Musicians Seeking Management,1,1cehw1g,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1cehw1g/iso_talented_musicians_seeking_management/,3,"Hello musicians!

I'm a digital marketing and music promotion expert with over 5 years of experience in the industry. I've worked with various artists, helping them to build their online presence, reach new audiences, and grow their fan base. For some concrete credibility, the biggest artist I‚Äôve worked with (so far) is Tory Lanez. I have also worked with top music festivals like Rolling Loud and have connections across virtually all major record labels (UMG, Periscope, Dreamville, etc.).

I recently left working directly in the music industry to pursue a career in digital marketing, but I didn‚Äôt realize how much I‚Äôd miss working with exciting new artists. Which brings me to my request. I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity to work alongside an up-and-coming artist on a mission to make it big. I am not looking for any compensation for the work, just an opportunity to grow with an awesome artist.

If you're an independent artist looking to take your music career to the next level, I'd love to hear from you. Whether you're just starting out or already have a following, I can help you develop and execute a comprehensive digital marketing strategy tailored to your specific goals.

My strengths include:
 - Social media management and growth
 - Content creation (photos, videos, graphics)
 - Email marketing and newsletter campaigns
 - Spotify playlist promotion
 - Influencer outreach and collaborations
 - Online advertising (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok)
 - Website optimization and SEO
 - Live performance strategy and booking

If you're interested in working together, please email me at mvpmusicmgmt@gmail.com with a link to your music or Spotify profile. I'll review your submission, and if I think we'd be a good fit, I'll reach out to discuss further details and potential collaboration opportunities.

Let's take your music to new heights!

22,Think less about what fans can do for you:,21,1cdzrf6,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1cdzrf6/think_less_about_what_fans_can_do_for_you/,15,"Balancing self-expression with serving your audience is crucial for success as an artist. Knowing your target demographic allows you to create content that resonates with them, rather than shouting into the void. 

Your entertainment style (music, fashion, videos, themes, social media, etc) isn‚Äôt for everyone. So who‚Äôs the average fan it‚Äôs for specifically?

Make a list of traits you think they have. For example, a band that sounds like Mumford & Sons will have a disproportionate amount of fans that drive Toyota and Subaru, enjoy hiking, listen to NPR, recycle, etc.

Marketing is a mixture of psychology and sociology. It involves building a brand your niche of followers identify with and nurturing relationships with them through thoughtful content. It's a symbiotic relationship where both artists and fans benefit.

Think less about what fans can do for you and more about what you can do for them.

Hope this helps!
