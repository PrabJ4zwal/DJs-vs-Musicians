"New /r/DJs  Rules.


**Top rule - BE NICE.**

* Please try to be polite, friendly and helpful when commenting.
* Trolling, slapfights, general assholery is not encouraged and it also goes without saying that **racist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic posts and language will not be tolerated** at all.

**Moderation policy**

* /r/DJs is not a big sub.  We tend to encourage discussion and engagement first and foremost.  There will be times posts that are seemingly against the sub rules will be left up because the discussion in the comments is informative and engaging.  This is generally more for when a post breaking (certain) rules was missed and the community has already heavily engaged in discussion.  If you see posts breaking the rules, reporting them will help us remove them earlier.
* remember to search - lots of questions tend to be asked multiple times and plenty of answers are given in the archives
* remember that if you are a regular user, newer users are allowed to discuss the same things if it's not overly-frequent.  Just because something was discussed 3 months ago doesn't mean users can't have another conversation about it.


**Please ensure you are posting to the correct subreddit**

 * /r/DJs is generally for more experienced/professional DJ discussion.  There is an entire subreddit dedicated to learning DJing and is filled with experienced DJs willing to spend time helping people out.

**Any and all beginner questions and posts should be made in /r/Beatmatch.**

*Beginner questions include posts that start with:*
 
* “I’m new at this”
* “I want to get into DJing”
* “I just started”
* etc.

*And includes anything basic like:*

* “What controller/headphones/speakers should I buy?” (within reason - someone experienced looking for higher end gear or looking for real world feedback on pro-level stuff is fine).
* “What program should I use?”
* “How do I use this effect?”
* “Is beat matching really important?”
* “Why the hate for sync?”
* etc.

*Any beginner posts here will be deleted.*


**DJ Setup pictures belong in /r/DJsetups.**

* There will be some exceptions - some rare or classic booths or extraordinary setups will stay up, but if you want to post a picture of your DDJ 400 and KRK Rockits, your Technics 1200s and DDJ S9, or a standard CDJ NXS setup that we've all seen, please post to the appropriate sub.

**Meme/Humor/crappy image posts belong in /r/DJsCircleJerk.**

* This includes the low effort, ""djs be like dis” - *stupid picture* - type posts and the like.

**Mixes**

* Most mix posts will be deleted. 
* Short routines, showcasing of interesting technique, and videos that shows off the poster doing something cool is fine. We will also allow high profile posts - say if a regular user gets a feature mix on DJCity or a Serato sponsored set.
* Sets from high profile DJs like boiler room or festivals sets is allowed.
* DJs who want to share mixes can post in /r/mixes or a weekly mix thread that we will be starting soon.

**Gig pictures/Stories**

* We're starting a new weekly sticky every Monday specifically for gig pictures and stories.  We've been seeing a lot more of these posts and while they tend to be heavily upvoted, they also end up just being a picture of some DJ hunched over a setup with a bunch of back-patting in the comments that clutters up the sub.  Any posts of this nature will be deleted and the user will be directed to the weekly Sticky thread.

**The following topics are against sub rules and will be deleted:**

* Self-promotion posts including mixes, tunes, events, companies, competitions, etc.  The one exception we may allow are open deck nights that members of /r/DJs can attend.
* For-sale posts
* Posts discussing music piracy (in the sense of people asking how where or how to pirate music, if you want to have an actual discussion on piracy and how it pertains to the industry, by all means).  Support the people who make your hobby/career possible. 
* Obvious spam for youtube channels/gig logs/blogs/advertisements from members who have no participation in the sub. If people are regular posters on this sub and have a video/service/etc they wish to share, we will allow it initially, although regular spam of it will not be tolerated.
* Posts asking “what should I play for this gig?”  This is a sub for experienced DJs, if you need to ask the internet what to play for a gig, you probably shouldn't have taken the gig.  General music discussion is absolutely fine.
* Spotify playlist posts

PLEASE REPORT posts and comments that violate the above rules or just suck. Thank you!"

"I’m looking for a way to record DJ Mixes including the audience and was asking myself what the best equipment would be? Ideally something that wouldn’t bother DJs too much. What equipment do you recommend?

In theory I would like something I could transport easily and lay down in the DJ booth and it would record the set in a good quality. Including a good microphone that's resistant to weather conditions. Is this realistic?

I’ve seen something in this video which comes close to what i’m thinking about but not sure if this device is actually there to record the mix\^\^

"my favorite genre has always been that late night deep house sound that you can picture yourself driving to after dark through empty streets. i’m currently looking to add to my playlist and generally learn more about it. are there certain keywords i can search for to find more of this sound? is there an actual name for it? any songs, djs or label suggestions would be greatly appreciated. the link i provided is a perfect example of what i’m looking for.

p.s. can anyone tell me what type/name of sounds are used for this genre when producing?

TIA!

"This is obviously basic info, but I've been doing some housekeeping in Rekordbox and it's so rewarding! I'd love to get some insights and tips on how you keep things organized!

I play (very) open format and have been building my Rekordbox collection since I started in 2017. In the early stages I had the approach that it's better to have too much music for my 4hr set, and still I kept running out of songs to fit the vibe. So the collection kept building.

Some of my playlists have been big umbrella lists like ""Everything Hiphop"" or ""Everything 80s"" playlists. These last few years though I've been avoiding browsing those 1000 song lists while playing because they're just overwhelming and fruitless. So instead I stick to my newer, more specific playlists, e.g. ""Lo-fi House"" or ""Latin Disco"".

I realized there were an astonishing number of tracks I've never even played since 2017, which can be either reasonable or unfortunate. So I've started going through all the songs with 0 plays (then 1, 2 etc.) in my playlists and removing a whole lot of meh songs from the collection which were really just added in fear of running out of music. Some get to stay but in some other playlist, some get updated with new tags etc.

It feels so inspiring knowing that there are a lot less filler tracks in there and that the songs are in the playlist they belong! It's a never-ending work of course, but it's so worth it.

What are your tips for housekeeping?"
"My fellow music nerds, listen up:

This recent study analyzed a sample of 12000 songs spanning 40 years. The findings confirmed an ongoing trend of lyrics becoming simpler and more repetitive.

What's new and somehow not surprising: They also found shifts in the lyrical content. Mood wise lyrics became less happy, more sinister. And the use of self relating words (I, me, myself, ...) has risen, hinting at a more self focussing attitude in society.

Feel free to discuss. Or to nod slowly, murmuring ""I *knew* it"" because that's what reading science is really about."

Is it safe to pack XLR cables, mic, Headphones (if they'll fit) in the space in the flight case?"
"Been making music for a while but want to finally release and perform live. Being around the scene, I’ve noticed an uncomfortable number of ‘dj’s’ that give 0 fucks about the craft and only care about the lifestyle and making sure their socials make them look as cool as possible. 

I know it’s a tale as old as time and will always be a part of the industry/culture, but, for those of us that just love music and the craft and don’t need substances to find joy in sharing music you love with others, how did you differentiate yourself? 

To me, hiding my identity makes it more believable that I’m in it for the music and I don’t need to worry about always maintaining appearances/looking cool for instagram. Also I feel like so much of the discourse around music revolves around identity politics these days which to me (queer POC) still feels backwards. Music is one of the most powerful tools of unity we have as a species - it’s a truly universal language! Yet it feels like we often use it as a means of exclusion and ego/status. 

It’s one of the things I’ve always admired most about daft punk (I know their faces are out there but to most people who were unfamiliar with their faces but loved their music, daft punk could have been anyone) and other similar artists, although in recent times, it’s turned into a bit of a gimmick. What are y’all’s thoughts on this? 

But also wearing a mask every time sounds like it would quickly become annoying as F U C K so maybe that trumps all the sentimental bs above lol"
"Hi people, i keep seeing more and more people use Sony mdr 7506 headhpones, i’ve only ever used Senheiser, could you advise which one is better and why people choose Sony? Is it like a personal preferance? Also most of these people who use mdr they play on vinyls, so i’m very curious what’s the deal"
"Check out this massive, clustered database of what appears to be all genres and sub genres of all songs on Spotify, ever.

You can click a genre name to hear an example and search artist names to see where they cluster in the genre space. 

Some weird examples:

- Georgian Electronic 
- Turkish Deep House
- Greek Downtempo
- Tiajuana Electro
- Fogo Pentecostal 
- Tanzanian Hip Hop

Hi! I’m in the market of new speakers for my dj set up. I mainly do small gigs like maybe max 100 people but I’m expanding so in the future may be doing bigger gigs. I do both indoor and outdoor events. Qsc is on say for 899 which is the same price as the Ev. I’m looking for mainly sound quality. Any input would be great!
Did it help you get gigs? New to a city and  know some people but still getting the ball rolling. Mostly trying to get gigs at bars and small clubs for some extra income. Had a friend say it’ll only benefit you and had another friend say it’s not necessary unless your really big. Feel corny as hell making it but whatever

"Hey all - I have an upcoming gig for an opening day ceremony for youth flag football. Ive been told I’ll be set up on the track which is between the field and the bleachers. 

At my disposal, I’ll have two Turbosound ip1000s (column speakers/8”sub combo), 2 HH 15” subs with matching tops (can be pole mounted), and another 18” Mackie sub.

Any ideas on how to set this up to have decent coverage? I’m not sure if I should spread everything out or keep it condensed and angled or couple the subs and space out the 2 tops. 

Thanks in advance "
Hey guys. I've noticed that my records seem to get cue burn quite fast when playing gigs. (After 4 - 5 times even.)

Is it possible to ""push"" a new music culture in a country? Or should I just play House, wich I still fairly like, seeing how I would get 50x the gigs? Can anyone relate to this in other countries even about other genres (IE maybe Techno not being as hard in the UK)? Do you guys also think it is possible for a good enough Dj to make a dj being booked from abroad and travelling for it? Sorry if this post is out of place."
"Hi gang,
I’ve been DJing on Pioneer and Technics gear for a good few years now. Currently on holiday in Barcelona and spotted an open decks night tonight, and I always have a USB on my keys so I figured I’d have a go. I’m playing in an hour.

They’re using Denon SC6000M decks, as someone who’s used to CDJs is there anything I need to be aware of beforehand? I understand all decks function in basically the same way, just curious if there are any quirks to the Denons that are likely to trip me up.

Cheers!
Joey 



UPDATE: It went flawlessly, no issues with the gear whatsoever and people seemed to dig my tunes. Good stuff!"
"I decided to upgrade my ddj1000 to 2 XDJ’s MK2 1000 and a 2 channel mixer but I can’t seem to decide between each of them ? I love the sound of the Xone-92/96 but people seems to have different opinions when it comes to the 23 ? What’s yours ?

Note : I want to be able to just mix in headphones (like when you press the master cue on the DJM) is it something possible on the Xone ?

thank u so much for your kind answers 💞"
"Looking at a new mixer and wondering if there is a difference in longevity and compatability between internal and external interface.  

I don't want to pay for internal interface on mixer and not have drivers or operating system support it anymore in the future. Would external interfaces have the same concern?
Would also like to know if internal interfaces are capable of being used with all other dj software if needed. Worse can scenario I could always use something different if needed."
"Hi,

I want to start mixing vinyl at raves in the near future, after always doing it digitally. I've been mixing vinyl at home for a few years, but that's always in a more controlled setting with a stable table etc. I was wondering, what are some ways of dealing with needle skips, or just absolute train wrecks of a transition when playing in front of 100+ people? Two recent cases which I picked up at an all vinyl rave;

* The needle got stuck in a loop and skipped during a track. After around 3 iterations the DJ accelerated the record quickly right when the skip would happen and 'dragged' the record out of the loop. 
* DJ was working on a transition but everytime he was about to blend the new track in, the original track skipped, causing the tracks to no longer play in sync. He then immediately cut away the new track, beatmatched it and then tried again. Original track kept skipping. Above happened 3-4 times. Eventually he just pressed the stop button of the original track, let the track come to a full brake and just started the new record from the beginning. Despite the 'fuck up' the crowd was cheering a lot!
* Can't find a link on youtube so excuse the facebook link, but [this](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=299175728054417) needle skip fix by Fjaak is really cool. They just hit the turntable at the right time causing the needle to hop over the skipping point.

  
Would love to hear your stories or tricks to handling these situations! "

"i’ve been djing with vinyl for events and party’s for a few years now and i’ve been recently interested in using my MK2 for effects during my sets.

from what i’ve seen i know i could run my signal from my mixer into the MK2 and then from the MK2 to my PA speakers. that way i can use the effects on the master of both turntables.

basically posting this because im wondering if anyone else does this or something similar. id love to see what other people have done with it and if anyone has advice on how i should run everything into my PA.

any other thoughts/ideas/concerns would be great to hear as well

thanks!"

"Hi,

Every time I post questions about using Rekordbox or Virtual DJ in combination with Pioneer or Denon DJ controllers that have a screen i get the same answer:

""You shouldn't use a laptop. Use the screen on the controller.""

But I absolutely hate using that screen. My personal reason is that with my dyslexia a laptop is already hard enough to read and type. Reading and typing on a controller is absolutely exhausting for me. It's just one wall of words. Also, i mistype a lot and in an laptop it's so much easier to correct spelling mistakes. I would spend more time finding a song than actually on reading the crowd 

Plus I don't think the screens on controllers don't have the technological features a laptop has 

Are there any other DJ's that hate using the screena on controllers for their own reasons?"
"Hey everyone!

I've hit a bit of a snag with an upcoming event I'm involved in.

I've been asked to DJ for a local running event right here in our hometown. The twist? It's set along a trail that winds through the forest, off the beaten path. The event organizer has requested that I set up amidst the trees and provide a lively soundtrack to keep the runners motivated as they pass by—think cheering, name-calling through the mic, the whole nine yards.

However, there's a challenge: there's no power source I can connect to. I have a Soundboks speaker and DDJ FLX4 that are easily carried to the spot I'm supposed to be in (can't get there by car).

Now, here's where I could use some advice: Is there a way for me to link up the controller with the speaker without a power outlet? Through the battery? Perhaps via a phone or iPad to the controller? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
"Hey 
So I’m a music producer and I already have connections, I have music signed in record labels (techno music) 
And I know how to Dj basically, already performed a few times and got lots of great feedback, I know that I can do good and perform in clubs &amp; festivals. 
But I don’t know why I stop myself from doing so, it’s like I have a fear that is holding me back, there’s no other reason for that to happen, because I know my worth (of course it’ll take time to blow up but I know that I’m capable of starting, even if it’s starting small)
It’s a mindset shift that I need to do I guess, and I need to push through that fear, but somehow I feel blocked. 
Any help and support from other artists would be really helpful! 
Thanks :) "
"We mostly focus on the technical/skill/talent/competence aspect of djing. I’ve been thinking more about the other side of djing, the social status/ clout chasing element. I feel like I just don’t understand it. No one likes to talk about it, but it really does feel like a popularity contest when we really get down to it. Some djs are more artistically motivated than others. But it’s impossible to ignore the forces at work. There are so many young kids just looking for attention and social status and to party with famous hot people. Obviously there are little pockets in each scene where people try to filter out that energy and enjoy a more communal experience that values authenticity. When we get more into the commercial side of the scene, obviously streaming numbers and ticket sales are what make the difference. But what about the less commercial side of djing? Is it more based on who you know? Or how long you’ve been around? How do you get your foot in the door when you’re just a normal dude without a huge following or critical acclaim? Do local venues just see how many followers you have on IG and decide like that?"
"Hi y'all,

Has this happened to anyone with the Reloop Tape 2???

I recorded a set on my DJM900 Nexus with the Reloop tape 2. The levels were fine (according to the Signal light, and the Record light was flashing normally), and I'm sure I set it up correctly. I've used it many times.

However, this time I went to transfer my 3hr set from the device to the computer and when i uploaded it into Audacity, I see there is NO sound--no waveform.

But it still recorded the 3 hours because the two files are around 2GB and around 250MB. 

I double checked the input gain on the Reloop, and it was at an appropriate level, and the Signal/Peak light was green whenever i looked at it throughout the set.

Is it possible that the audio is SOMEWHERE inside the Reloop's mini SD and i just need to...find it??? Or is it lost and I just need to accept it?

(I think i'm done with my Reloop Tape two and ready for a Tascam...but I'd really love to have the recording of my set if it's possible!)."
"Has anyone ever felt like you are mentally incompatible with your gear?

A few months ago I upgraded to a prime 4+ from a pair of CDJs 2k/DJM 900nxs after one of my CDJs melted and ever since I upgraded I've been struggling to convert my work flow over to thr new hardware.  I'm at the point where it feels like I don't even know how to DJ anymore because I can't make the hardware do what's in my head let alone get into a flow state.  Don't get me wrong I don't think it's the prime 4s fault I just don't know if I'm mentally compatible with it."

"Hello!
So i have potential chance of investing this year to better gear.
I’m leaning more towards turntable setup, with vinyls and also digital vinyls (with laptop).
So the question is, i have probably around 2k€ (2.1k$) to invest into new gear. 
Should i buy Technics, which probably will run me 1k per piece and opt for more less fancy mixer, break little bit of my back financially, but then be happy with my workhorse, which will probably last me for the next lifetime.

OR

Opt out with Audio Technicas or Pioneer PLX-500/1000, which will be cheaper, and also buy a fancier mixer with leftover money?

"For the people who have access to the right speakers / subs and the proper space to try out, I would like to introduce an experiment to settle what I heard about the difference between uncompressed music vs mp3s.

Here is the argument:  When the uncompressed version of the track is played with the big speakers, some of the inaudible frequencies that are cut for the mp3 may be felt *physically* *different* in the uncompressed versions when played with proper speakers.

According to this idea, with the uncompressed music, the massaging /thumping sensation of bass and other physical aspects of the overall music is enhanced. So with the mp3s part of this *physical sensation* may be lost. This means that you hear the same sounds with mp3, but *might* *feel* less of it throughout the rest of your body.

So for the people who are willing to do this, it is of utmost importance to pretend that your ears do not exist. Try to feel the music only with the rest of your body, do the bass, the highs, the mids of the track feel somewhat *physically* different when you perceive their vibrations in wav or aiff vs mp3 formats?

Is anyone here able to test it out?"

"Hey, I did a event last night they payed me to play at a bar but I had to bring my whole set up, and I didn’t know they were able to smoke inside the bar. Does anyone know how to get rid of the cigarette smell off the speakers, cases, lights? I can’t leave them outside since it’s raining right now any other options? "
"i’ll preface this question by saying it’s obviously very dependent on rhythm and musical style, but if you had to generalise, what tempo do you cruise at when trying to build a vibe?


please also mention if you generally play in particular styles/genres and if you mean in a bar/club context 



i’ve been playing regularly at this local bar which has a nice energetic atmosphere and a chunky sub (an RCF system - a bit ‘pointy’ to my ears, but gets things done:) generally i like to start around crunchy instrumental hip hop tempos and then into 105-115 funky crunchy electronic beats (breaks, house, techno, electro and disco)…. and then i like to move around, jumping between 120-135 (doing sections of them). and i enjoy dipping into some 140, both straighter and more dubstep leaning (i mean proper more mnml dubstep). and if the night calls for some 150bpm madness and some footwork/jungle, all the better!

anyway…. im wondering if im spending too much time in hip hop tempo….? i’ve noticed i could use more tunes around 110bpm

these sets are (unfortunately) being played on CDJ-350s (i have &amp; love my 2000s and Technics at home). 350s are fucking difficult to ‘make a story’ with. the displays suck, like playing on a calculator. but the gigs are fun once a vibe has been built:) i’ll always improvise in these gigs, which keeps things interesting (for me, anyway!). tonight i blended Kraftwerk with some Norwegian abstract house (if i remember correctly). about 40 years of electronic music in 7 mins? 😎

just curious what others do to build a vibe 😎

"Some context:

I consider myself a beginner DJ because I only really started DJing back in September 2023. I use Virtual DJ with a DDJ200 mainly because I come from a lower class family and don't really have the money to get Serato or upgrade my equipment. I've played at school events, a few birthday parties and at some cafes/ lounges and people always say I'm good at DJing. My friend hired me for my biggest gig yet a few weeks ago, a yacht party which was earlier today.

So I reached there half an hour early to set up. One thing to note is that when I've needed to use my own equipment at venues where a controller isn't provided, because the DDJ 200 doesn't have audio output, I always carry a 3.5mm to dual 1/4 inch splitter with me that I connect through my laptop aux to a mixer. When I got to the yacht today and started setting up I realized that the yacht's sound system didn't use a mixer with the input I needed. The company who owned the yacht provided me a controller though, a DDJ1000SRT, which I quickly downloaded the drivers for and started trying to get used to. That was when I hit my biggest roadblock: because all the DJs who the yacht company employed used Serato, the mapping was all over the place for me. Deck A gave me no problems, but the knobs for Deck B weren't mapped for VDJ at all. 

By the time I realized this, the party was supposed to start in 15 minutes so I started freaking out. I tried restarting my laptop, redownloading the drivers and going through everything in the VDJ settings and I still couldn't fix the mapping. People started coming on to the yacht and the employees said I needed to start playing music at the point, so I gave up and loaded up my tracks. My first few transitions were really basic but in around 10 minutes I started to get the mapping. Although there were still a few features in the software that the mapping on the controller didn't allow me to use, I started using some new techniques for mixing that I've never used before and slowly started to adapt. Despite how awful the set started out it ended as possibly my best set yet. 

I guess I'm just trying to say that I learnt an extremely important lesson today despite my good set: ALWAYS CHECK WITH THE VENUE ABOUT WHAT THE SETUP IS LIKE. Most people in this subreddit most likely already do that, but for those who don't you definitely need to start."
"I currently have a Rane One, but it's starting to crap out on me, and I might have to start looking into another controller. I currently live in Korea so any DJ gear is 3 times what it is in the states so like a Rev 7 is like $3,000 so that's out of the question .

The question I want to ask is, is the Hercules T7 any good for anyone who owns one, and worth replacing the Rane over?"
"I finally got a residency at a bar I have been trying to play for months just a few weeks ago. I play Friday nights while a guy who works for the same dj company I do plays Saturdays. He is in his 50’s and has been djing for way longer than I have (I’m 23). Every time I have played at this bar I have packed the floor and had people chant for an encore so I am familiar with this crowd and know what they like and how to get them hyped. 

Anyway my coworker stopped in tonight to watch me and I let him hang out with me in the booth. I was kind of put off when he told me to move over while he mixed a few tracks without asking me permission if he could. After he went to grab a drink he started texting me that I went into a “hood” rap set far too early in the night and that I should make more of an effort to blend my tracks better despite the fact that I was key and beatmatching and mixing in each song at least 8 bars before i made a full switch. 

Later, he came back up to the booth and hijacked my controller again and kept criticizing everything I was doing. The last straw for me was when I saw him load up a track I was hoping to save for later in the night. I told him not to play it because I wanted to save it and he went ahead and mixed it anyway. I then told him that while I appreciate his feedback and recognize that he has been doing this way longer than me, he was overwhelming me and that I wanted him to leave me alone. He told me to relax and have fun and that he never intended to piss me off, but that I needed to listen to him and learn from him. He could then see me become visibly upset and started apologizing and telling me I was doing a good job afterall. After we went b2b on a couple more songs, he finally left me alone and left the bar without saying goodbye, which is unlike him as he is usually very friendly. 

I look up to this guy a lot and worry that I came off as sensitive and unteachable, but like I said before I worked my ass for this residency and feel like he had no business “schooling” me on the spot like that, especially when he will be playing that same venue the following day and has had his residency there for years while this is finally my time to shine. I still get nervous at the beginning of my sets but once I get into the flow I’m good for the night. His barging in like that threw me off and stopped me from getting out of my head. Once he left I felt better and had a great rest of the night, but I cant stop thinking about how much better it would have been had he not intruded like that. Thoughts?"
"I bought the audio technica 1240x and the tone arm feels very cheap to me. Should I have purchased the pioneer plx 1000?  My last set of turntables were the numark ttx USB.

"Hey all,

I’m currently DJing an event and my PA speakers were in direct sunlight for about 2 hours playing at a loud volume in about 70 degree weather. 2 hours into the gig, they provided me with a tent and I moved them under cover. The speakers were pretty warm to the touch but weren’t scalding hot or anything. Did I mess up my speakers at all for these 2 hours of direct sunlight? They are EV ELX112P speakers. Thanks for any insight."
"Saw this clip drunk browsing on Instagram and thought I saved it to go back and watch the whole set. Didnt save it and have now asked all my DJ friends and searched on google for hours. Still cant find it.

The DJ is a very overweight man wearing a dark coloured polo I think, DJing for a packed crowd in a dark, cramped night club sweating his man boobs off.'

When he drops the beat it's so filthy the crowd goes wild and immedately demands he pull it up and do it agin.

"Basically I’m stuck between which one of the two mixers to get, from what I see they’re both great mixers but the 96 has more features, however I’ll only be using the mixer on my home set up of 2 x turntables.

I’ll be looking to add some cdjs at some point but I’m in no rush. I’ve seen that the xone 92 is quieter when playing vinyl than the 96. I’ve also seen the filter pops or something on the 92. 

Basically will I notice the difference massively in just a home setting?

I have been looking at 18” powered subwoofers over the last few weeks.  Paying most attention to frequency response.  I play a lot of hip hop and want to get a sub that will play as low as possible even if I’m sacrificing some spl.

"I recently attended a small concert in Seattle and was very impressed by the PA system that they had, yet I didn't recognize the logo on the speakers.  They were a small line array style, I'm guessing no more than two 8"" woofers in the cab and had a logo that looked like this.  

I've searched through several of my favorite retail outlets for equipment but came up dry as to what they were.   And yes I realize there is far more to getting amazing sound out of a PA than just ""what speakers did they use""  but this is one piece of the puzzle that I'm missing.

"Hi all,

"Looking for a place to get hardware skins. I am aware of [DJ Skins](https://dj-skins.com/), [Doto Designs](https://dotodesign.it/en/), and [12 Inch Skins](https://12inchskinz.com/). DJ Skins are extremely tacky and not very affordable especially considering you have to pay a considerable amount to remove their logo from the skin. 12 Inch Skins are affordable but their selection is pretty slim and unattractive. Doto Designs have the best designs by far. All very elegant and sophisticated but they are pretty expensive and ship outside the USA which makes the shipping over $25. Id consider Doto if the shipping wasnt so much. Doto does have their logo on the skin but it looks nice and I dont mind it. 

So with all that said Im looking for more companies that supply skins. Surprisingly there dont seem to be too many that exist. At least non that I can find. Anyone know of others?"

After that I was very unimpressed, but loaded up some lo-fi I have been accumulating and mixed for about an hour.

Well guess what after that I was actually pretty calmed down lol. Music is and always will be one of my favorite forms of therapy. I'd say it's cheaper too but we all know what the damn gear costs lol"
"As of now I have only used a DDJ-400 regularly and experimented with a DDJ-FLX6 and DDJ-1000. While I may buy a controller to hold myself over in the short-term, I eventually want a more ""final"" setup. I was considering some Allen-Heath mixer such as Xone 96 and 4 sets of Technics turntables. I am very enthusiastic about the vinyl feel and scratching, but also love to mix a lot of songs fast. This has lead me to seriously consider DVS in my future. I've been a Rekordbox diehard and have thousands of songs cued with beatgrids. Is there a software with better DVS compatibility that would be worth the switch?"
"In what direction is the music industry going? Deadmau5 said in some interview that edm follows the latest technology, Im thinking where at some form of max level now. Spotifys CEO said that hes open to let consumers remix songs in some way, something im already relying on in my gigs, which works great. All top lists and obviously tiktok is filled with old hits and remakes. If every hit ever made was one song, it feels like that song is loaded and we´re shortening the loop, you all know where that ends.

Anyway I would love to hear anyones thoughts on this topic, not as dj looking for new songs, just a discussion about the trajectory of music. "

"I'm on the hunt for a new pair of speakers as I'm replacing what I sold when I was raising funds for buying a house. Previously I had Yamaha HS8s which I'd previously bought when I had aspirations to produce music. Now I just want something for purely DJing without the harsh top end of the Yamaha.

My friend had old KRK Rokits that I liked for the low end, but I've read that the newer G4/G5 have a flatter sound. I've read good things about Focal Alpha having a nice low end and sweet spot. Any DJs here using them? 

I would look at PA speakers or large bookshelves, but if I bought any I feel I'd just be taking a stab in the dark as I've no experience of listening to those types of speakers.

Edit: To add, I'm in Scotland and I think it's rather limited to zero on places with setups to hear speakers before purchasing, unless anyone can point me in the right direction. "
"Wondering what the real benefit of an Isolator such as TEIL3 B&amp; from Rampa's electronics company. Here are two demos ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV31jhgA9Hs) and [2](https://www.instagram.com/p/C50wItxM2d1/?img_index=2)). The device is the same as the low/mid/high EQs mixers have on channels, except this is for the Master output (which some mixers like the v10 have).

Besides the Master vs. Track ISO, and the big button it has to turn off the iso effect, are there any noteworthy differences between what this does and what a mixers EQs do? 

I'm trying to understand the value. The places I play at usually have DJM-750Mk2s and I play with an XDJ-RX3 at home.

"Hey everyone,

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice. I've had some not-so-great experiences with DJs in the past, and I'm struggling to find a reliable and talented one for my upcoming event. Can anyone share some tips on how to spot a good DJ and where to find them?

The last few times I hired a DJ, they either didn't have the right vibe for the event, played outdated music, or simply lacked professionalism. I want to avoid making the same mistake again and ensure that the next DJ I hire really knows how to keep the crowd entertained and the energy high.

So, what should I look for when searching for a DJ? Are there any red flags to watch out for? And where are the best places to find reputable DJs? I'd appreciate any insights or recommendations you can provide.

Thanks in advance for your help!"

One of the topics in this week's Ask Me Anything live stream for DJs was all about dissecting what went awry with Grimes at Coachella 2024.

"I am considering starting a side-business DJ'ing weddings. I've worked as a stagehand for well over a decade, and know my way around most live lighting and sound equipment, and happen to have everything besides a lighting package ready to go. I'm looking for some stories and wisdom about what it was like to get started DJ'ing weddings. How did you put together your first contract? Or heck, how did you even go about getting booked? What do you use to transport your equipment safely and professionally? How do you price your services? (if it helps, I'm in the upper Midwest).

I have a portable powered PA (tops and bottoms), a small mixer, laptop running Tidal, wireless mics (lavaliers and handhelds), and if things get really serious, a passive 18"" sub. I would look to purchase a lighting package. I'm not someone who looks to nickel and dime, but I am wondering how people go about add-on services and pricing. Ex: We want amplified music at the ceremony and the reception (which IMO would require 2 PA's, since it's not efficient to setup + tear down and move a PA, then do it all again at the end of the night).

"Grimes will play again I suspect.

Moving forward she will have to face the global public again if she expects to maintain this career. Probabilities are that she will perform another gig in the future for the celebrity and money.

If she expects this attention to go away, the fucking best DJ set of her life will need to be performed, and we will need to see the mixing in action, otherwise everyone will call it out as fake yet again.

"So I just got off the phone with a potential client that asked if I could lower my (already low) rate after receiving my quote. He owns an event company and mentioned he already told his client the DJ budget would be $760 for the 8hr event from another DJ they were going to book quoted them. I quoted him $1000 for the 8hrs, taking into consideration that he mentioned they’re looking for another DJ for future events. 

Yes I know 1k is already way too low, and I told him my rate is already low for the size of this event (~800 people) but on precidence of working together on future events I am willing to do $800 + lighting rental costs for this event. 

My question is, was this a mistake? Should I have stayed firm on my rate and potentially lose a valuable lead with lots of future events?

With that said, it would be too soul sucking for me to play the same bullshit I hear at literally every wedding. 

My question for experienced wedding DJs, if you play fun up beat music that isn't as known (eg 1mil to 50mil view type tracks) and play styles across a few genres keeping in mind the genre preference of the wedding couple, and combine that with house remixes of classic songs for familiarity while strategically inserting the odd typical song, would crowds respond well to this?

Can someone explain why? I literally have no clue.

"Hi All.

I read the rules of this sub and this post should be ok, as it's an ""open decks"" type situation.**Softclip Records** (softclip selects) are looking for someone to fill a mix slot on their weekly mix series ""HOUSE '24"". This is short notice as we've had a DJ pull out due to their computer going in for repair.

I said I'd help fill the slot, and thought this sub would be a good place to start.

They need a mix of duration &gt;**45 minutes (minimum)**, by the **21st of April** (one week from now). Mix would need to be in **.wav or .flac**, provided by a cloud storage link (google drive or similar). Mix will be uploaded on the 23rd. We operate at a loss typically, and most DJ's jump on for free, but I'll also wire someone a quick **$30 USD** via paypal for the short notice.Mixes must be **House music**, focusing mostly on **funky / lofi house**.Look up softclip on YouTube or SoundCloud first, make sure you fit the vibe. I've edited the about section on my profile so you can find them.DM with any example mixtapes you've recorded previously! Thanks guys!

I'm the owner of an Xone PX5 and am seeking feedback from other users of this mixer.

They have 6 JBL 12” speakers with an input and output xlr only no 1/4 mono. One of them we will call the master outputs into the next one and so on. They allow me to go into their input of the master and run it that way and that’s it. 

I have a simple setup. Laptop to mixer and 2 speaker output. So what I did was took the right speaker and powered the master. The issue is I only get the right channel sound on the restaurants speakers. 

At least if they had a 1/4 mono I could run mono from my mixer and it would sound better. My speakers sound fine, it’s their speakers that are daisy chaining that sound bad. Is there a solution for this like a splitter that I can go into that will run both my channels output into 1 xlr input and make the daisychain sound half way decent?

Thanks for your help

Hi guys my husband’s birthday is coming up and he’s been a vinyl dj for more than over a decade. He quit to focus on his corporate career years ago and he’s now ignited his passion for it again and he played his first show again about a week ago. He’s been talking about getting a controller but it’s very expensive for my pocket lol. Is there any accessories I can buy him for his birthday that you guys recommend that isn’t insanely expensive? Thank you!! 
This last dig I kept track of how many tracks I previewed vs how many I actually bought. Do you ever try to calculate how much garbage/mediocre stuff you need to sift through to get to the bangers? 
Going to be visiting Dublin coming up and I'll be there through the weekend.  Does anyone have any recommendations for record shops or clubs or bars or other spots to dance and hear some DJs?  How is the scene there?  I imagine it's pretty great.  Also open to any other suggestions for places to check out or things to do unrelated to music and dancing.
"Too many factors here for anyone's response to be right or wrong. I don't dj anymor hee (haven't in years) but a good friend was desperate to have some one dj brothers stag and do.(Who I don't know (big age gap between them)) Obviously this required me to put in a certain time commitment since I'm out of the game for a long time. I don't even know anyone at this gig to make it fun that way. Feeling a bit taken advantage of, but trying to make the most of it and just chalking this up to helping a friend out. He has shown appreciation, but doing this for free for people i don't know seems a bit annoying.

Have you ever done a long gig for free. Please share your stories, good, bad, joy, regret. "
"Hi everyone! Im hoping this community can help me.

I guess DMC Championship is still a relevant event in the modern djing communty, but im trying to recall an specific set from the first decade (or maybe two first decades) where the DJ (and im not sure it was a solo dj or a team, actually think it was a team) they took all Vinyls off the turntables and then pitched the static sounds in order to create a melody with the crossfader. 

If im right that it was a team, they were a pretty strong one (in terms of the djing community back then) but i cant recall the name, and therefore cant find the set. Ive tried google and all the basics but since im not native english i cant find it (specially since there are Dj static and Dj noize that are the results that pop up when trying to search it).

It blew my mind back then and i unlocked the memory recently, but im growing desperate trying to find it 

So if anyone could share some light on it, it would be delightful.

Thanks in advance!!!"
"I am quite worried about the future of DJing with AlphaTheta's purchase of Serato and unless InMusic (and other players) better structures itself, i don't see a positive future.

The current state of software according to the latest Digital DJ Tips survey is

|Software|Marketshare|
|:-|:-|
|Rekordbox|31%|
|Serato|30%|
|VirtualDJ|14%|
|Traktor|10%|
|Engine DJ|7%|
|Other|5%|
|Djay Pro|3%|

On the hardware side its

|Company|Marketshare|
|:-|:-|
|Pioneer|56%|
|InMusic\*|25%|
|Traktor|8%|
|Others\*|12%|

\* Denon 12%, Numark 9%, Rane 4%  
\*\*Other 2.8%, Technics 2.7%, Hercules 2.6%, Roland 1.7%, Reloop 1.6%, Allen &amp; Heath .6%

Outside of Engine, most InMusic hardware is designed to work with Serato, but has compatibility with other software like VDJ, DJay Pro. This merger is going to give Pioneer / AlphaTheta 61% of software market and will eventually decimate the hardware market.

InMusic doesn't seem to have a solid hardware or software strategy - they created Engine DJ to be embedded only with the desktop software only used to organize libraries and export to portable media. Maybe its because they didn't want to compete with their partner Serato - but their partner Serato will soon be their competitor.

Other brands that collab with serato will soon also see their marketshare diminish.

I believe Pioneer will take the best parts of Serato, implement into RekordBox and slowly disinvest in Serato (or vice versa for more of a money grab). I would love to be proven wrong, but I don't see why they would continue to develop these two softwares separately.

Lastly, it seems like InMusic is experimenting too much with its product lines and oversegmenting. The club level gear for Rane and Denon make sense, but then they release the Denon SC Live 4 which is more akin to the Numark line (which used to be pro before InMusic but is now really consumer only). The Rane One/Four controllers are club quality but not really club gear. Lastly, InMusic seems to be moving many of its Engine controller features to software only - which makes using laptop/software limit access to features. (Example, mic eq on SC Live 4 is accessible via touch screen but if you use Serato/VDJ, you lose access to mic eq)

Not saying other companies are better, but we need the industry to figure itself out before we end up with a bleak future.

What do you all think?"
"Hello dear community. I have a Xone:92 paired with a blue sky v1 Reverb Pedal. Suddenly out of the blue, my reverb pedal doesn‘t seem to function anymore at all.

"A little bit of context before the question:

With another 4 local DJs we have formed a DJs and Event Planner organization that cover only ""darkly oriented"" alternative music. Keep in mind that the ""darkly oriented"" music genres cover a lot of things (from goth rock to darktechno, let me put in this way), and we have different tastes in music and libraries as well.  
Today we are starting to plan the events for next year (so we are also talking of concerts and live act).  


Trying to make sense to our different tastes (and personal libraries) I try to associate every live act for next year to some of the dj.  
It was the most logic thing to me: if we call an Aggrotech band we cannot let a coldwave dj play after, same if we call a darkwave band we cannot let a darktechno dj play after, and so on. The public will be totally different and the dancefloor always empty and/or angry.

The other djs instead are arguing that: ""we can all play every genre, why are you assuming that we can't?"" 

It was a group chat but after that reply I'm honest I was a bit lost and drop the discussion.

For me divide our group in the most effective genre for every dj was the most reasonable solution, I was wrong at assuming this?

We know our style, history and library very well, so we know if one of us can cover a genre or not.

What did you think?   
I was wrong at assuming this kind of separation for future events?

"As is known, the tracks tend to sound more interesting and exciting when listened through proper club speakers. So fellow DJs, when you are digging your tracks, do you often think about how it may sound with proper club gear and decide accordingly, or do you mainly make your decision just based on what you hear through the ""usual"" gear at your disposal such as headphones or lesser-than-club level home speakers?

I do the latter, and I am beginning to doubt that this is the right course of action. Of course, if it already sounds really good with my own gear, then I will be 99% sure that it is going to be awesome with the club gear, but then I suspect that I may be missing out a lot of good tracks.



It is a tricky situation though, if the track sounds OK with my own normal gear, is it a good idea to get it, betting that it's gonna be great in the club, or is it better to not step out of the secure zone of heavy filtering through what I have at home?"

As a 25+ turntablist veteran, I couldn't be more in love with my rig, its my dream setup, but its just not feasible for travel, especially since DJaying has been downgraded to just a hobby. The Rane One looks like my answer. I'm seeing bundle deals that include a flight case for $1600.

"So, it's a common refrain that only idiots or noobs use autogain with Traktor. I'm confused by this, and here's why. If you activate autogain, it attempts to set the gain for you. However, you can manually adjust the autogain level, and once you find the right level it is saved. I like this a lot. I manually determined the gain based on levels and perceived loudness, and that info is now saved with the track.

I get that it's pretty stupid to just blindly allow autogain to pick your levels (I can't think of a single example where I didn't adjust the gain manually), but I do not think it is stupid to have a saved gain level based on manual adjustments.

In the dead ass Traktor sub, and to my knowledge here as well, Traktor autogain is universally shit on, and nobody has even mentioned this aspect of using autogain.

Am I stupid?

"Hey! I have an interview scheduled tomorrow at one booking agency. It will be actually our second interview. The first one was more to get know each other better. After the first interview they asked me to send an email where I explain how exactly I see my music career and after it was sent, they also came to check my performance at the party. After that they disappeared for 3 weeks and a week ago sent me an email offering to meet once more and discuss if and how exactly we could work together. I’m quite young dj, only about 4 years in a game. Recently I started producing and released my first track. Playing at top venues in Berlin and have a residency, however, the amount of gigs is very low- sometimes I dont have them at all the whole month, sometimes just 2-3 max. And this fact was something that confused them during the first interview.  They told most of gigs should come from a dj, not from them and sometimes its too early for a dj to enter the agency. My point is to help me to enter international market since I only play in Berlin for now. In general their behavior looks a bit confusing for me. Like they are interested in me as an artist, but have some doubts. What do you think about the whole situation and maybe someone have some tips on how to be confident/lead the conversation during the second interview to make this partnership come true? Thanks"

"I've been DJing  for about year now, with a few private parties and about 10 gigs at bars that have been pretty successful. These gigs were mostly Saturday afternoons, with a chill day-drinking vibe, and fine house music. The gigs (paid) went great and the owners were always satisfied.

Now, I'm looking to expand my horizons and venture into playing at restaurants. I've noticed a trend in some places, specially in bigger cities, where they're adding a bit of showmanship to the dining experience, like having dancers or circus performers. I've even seen[DJs mixing in restaurants](https://youtu.be/jDvvW0pf8wA?si=D-g65lHpwkQgjid9) on the internet and I love the idea. As a restaurant owner, it's for sure a cool way to add something extra to your place.

I'm curious if anyone here has experience with restaurant gigs. Specifically, I'm wondering about the practical side of things - do most restaurants have decent speakers, or do you need to bring your own gear? Did it take a lot of ""convincing"" to play there? Also, from a broader perspective, how do you view restaurant gigs as a DJ opportunity in general? Couldn't they be a fun and relatively low-effort way to make consistent money compared to the bigger bar and club gigs?

"I have a radio show I'm looking to improve my setup! Right now I essentially have 2 setups:

2 Pioneer PLX 500 turntables w/ a Headliner R2 Mixer

and a Denon Prime 2

I currently record the radio show strictly from the Prime 2, but I'm looking to have one combined setup where I can mix vinyl &amp; digital tracks.

I am considering a few options and would love any insight you have!

First, I plan to get an XLR mic (Rode, Shure, etc). Second, I plan to upgrade to a Mastersounds Radius 4 MK2. I love rotary mixers and can't afford many of the bespoke brands, so the Radius 4 seems like the one for me. Nonetheless, I'm open to any rotary recs you may have!

Where I really need help is in deciding which digital media players would make the most sense in my setup. I would ideally spend less than $1.5k USD. I'm considering the following (probably used):

XDJ-1000s

XDJ-1000MK2s

XDJ-700s

CDJ-900NXS

CDJ-900

Denon SC5000 &amp; LC6000

I'm not married to any brand or model. My top priorities are connectivity (the whole system just ""works"" together), Ease of use (some people who will be using the set-up aren't super experienced), and hopefully keeping these for a while.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated :)

"Was wondering if I could get a bit of perspective from more experienced DJ's about bringing your own decks for your performance, how much of it is an accepted practice vs how much is it a pain in the back-side for promoters/venues.

I would mention the venue in question are just town bars/clubs, a venue for punters to have a Saturday night out, have a few drinks and have fun. I presume that as the venues get larger, its more suitable to use more professional heavy duty equipment.

At a recent open deck spot, I had been given an hour set that stretched out to three.

For me as a DJ, I am inclined to put on a good performance, however when the kit changes often from venue to venue, spending a bit of time assessing the equipment for any deviations from other layouts drew time away from track selection and keeping the crown entertained.

I have been offered a paid spot in a few weeks time, so I feel inclined to put on a good set.

Some of the steps I have in mind is first checking with the promoter/venue,

Then other helpful, preventative tasks, such as coming in early, offering any help around set up, checking my gear and sound, preparing how it will be set up if a deck change is required etc etc. Got no issues paying my dues, just seeing if I would be wasting my time asking if I get any more offers to play in the future.

"Analogue vinyl dinosaur here. And without diving too deep, I have used Technic 1210s since ‘94 and would really appreciate some advice on “going digital”
So, I’m not a complete technophobe, I have created some tracks over the years using stand alone software and had a play around with some pioneer setups. However I’m looking to put on some small nights and have the opportunity to DJ at a friends regular night. I have in the past vinyl only and put on my own small acid/Chicago nights which has its own appeal but as I’ll now also be spinning indie music on some of the nights it just isn’t practical lugging loads of records about. We will still be mixing old skool house and acid for some of the nights, so a controller that is suited to both would also be great. I don’t have a massive budget as with family commitments and other hobbies I doubt I’ll have loads of time to play around and practice, so too many features may well be wasted on me. 
I have done some research and like the look of either a Traktor setup or a stand alone Numark Pro + but when I do some reading into each things get blurry. Especially from a compatibility standpoint with venues that might expect you to plug and play with their own equipment.

If someone could somewhat simplify all this for me, this would be great!"
"Completely random, but I’ve always wondered what the general consensus is with what DJ’s do with their phones while spinning? I know the answer will vary from individual to individual.

For example, do you leave it on Airplane/Do not Disturb mode? Do you turn it off completely? Do
You keep it on in case of emergencies? Do you occasionally scroll here or there and then get back to business?

The reason I ask is because I get very easily distracted, and I have often pondered what I would do during a set to prevent accidental muscle-memory scrolling/distractions. I feel like I would leave mine on Do Not Disturb but would have to keep Screentime on for the hour and only let specific contacts send notifications.

It's really annoying I can't cue next track without it looping what I'm trying too mix or worse just making a cue point and restarting the track from that cue point. Basically how can I turn this off?? I haven't turned it on so haven't got a clue. Hope this makes sense cheers x

"I saw an Instagram video the other day of a DJ podcast where someone said the Rane TT57SL was the worst mixer they have used. Hard time believing that. Us DJs with more than 15+ years will know that mixer was a game changer, the first widespread mixer with a built in Serato dongle. Every pro DJ I knew in the late 2000s had that thing. I used it from 2009-2012 and could take it out of storage tomorrow for a gig if I wanted to. That being said, what is truly the worst mixer you have used? My vote goes to the Novation Twitch. I bought this when it came out thinking it would be a nice alternative for smaller bars. Unknown to have horrible output (manager of bar I played at actually commented that it sounded worse than my last mixer (the 57SL) and controls were awkward. That was the last time I bought anything USB powered too. Sold it just a few weeks after buying it."
"I'm curious to know if anyone else has started intentionally avoiding extended cuts? I'm back into DJing after a massive gap, and immediately noticed tracks in general are shorter. At first I was intentionally finding extended cuts of things, but eventually gave up (If the extended cut on 3 minutes is 4 minutes, who cares lol) and leaned into basically a faster paced general style. There are genres I may play where I would know not to do so, but mostly I 'm playing electro style house which is fine with being kinda fast and aggressive. All the technology facilitates quick movement doing everything, so I'm leaning into it and really enjoying it 🙂"

"Hi everyone!

The genre I play most is DEEP TECH HOUSE (like Project 89, Kreech, Milion, Harrison BDP and so on) and these days I'm approaching the construction of a djset. I usually catalogue all my songs in the best way i can to play them ""in freestyle"", but sometimes doing like this don't give me the possibility to keep a mood or a ""story"" I want to tell with the music...or simply I don't understand if the flux have the right continuity or not. Somebody tell me, for example, to listen to the drums...that sometimes I started my sets with tracks with a too much ""detailed and complex"" drums...I cannot understand if it's a real important thing or not for people who listen to my gigs.

So here's the question: in your opinion, are there some elements that has to take in consideration (besides key and bpm, of course) to build a real story with music avoiding just putting music you like or that you think people could like most?

I know that everyone have a certain kind of musical taste and that a story belongs to those who tell it, but i think that there's maybe some ""rules"" to follow to keep coherence."

"I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a good quality external recording device that can be hooked up to a club mixer?

I'm currently using a zoom h1n but unless the input level is set really low, it has a tendency to clip badly.
It's fine for a studio environment but in a club where the levels tend to get pushed up higher it ends up sounding distorted.

Is there a better device available that has a bit more headroom so won't clip as easily?

Back in the day I used to use a mini disc and that was pretty much plug and play, with the internal limiter keeping the levels sounding good. Looking for something like that really.

Thanks!"
"When the move the channel faders on my mixer to the maximum position I am hearing noise/static/distortion type sounds.

Also seems to throw off the panning in some way for instance sometimes the right or left speaker signal will fall out entirely while maxing out the channel fader.

Cross fader also noisy at times.

I have made sure that there is no clipping going on with the channel gains and master gain. No excessive gain on amp either.

Is this a common issue?

Is this something that can be fixed or alleviated?

Thanks any advice is appreciated."
"I had a gig the other week and the sound guy told me to keep the mixer (DJM900nxs2) maxed to 0 DB during my set, which was only to the top of the green bars. I am used to having it maxed in the orange without redlining. I was under the impression I could have the mixer peaking just below the redline and that will keep the audio from distorting then the sound guy can adjust the master levels from their end. 

I noticed some DJ mixers like the DJMs go up to 10 db whereas others like the Rane Four only go up to 0 db.

So is it better to always have the master at 0 DB or should I go louder?  Why the inconsistency between mixers?

"I started spinning on vinyl during the early 80s. I had a gig in Berlin and after the set, I was packing up my crates and slipped on wet steps down a flight of stairs at the back of the club. Luckily nothing was broken but the incident is forever etched in my mind.  

When I hear people talking about vinyl, the memories flood into my mind and I’m repulsed. Still spinning today I like the convenience of showing up at a gig with a USB drive and when my friend was poetic about vinyl I don’t see it.  

I’d like to think that I’m over the fall but I legit don’t see any significant benefit off vinyl over tracks.  

A friend of mine invited me to spin at his house add we really have a good time but sometimes he makes a point to jab at me about playing tracks. I’ve never told him my story and just shrugged it off but he seems to be looking for some validation from me and I’m trying to be authentic but I feel like I’m running out of time with him because he keeps bringing it up.  

I’d really appreciate some good stories about vinyl that would perhaps trigger some good memories before were parted ways so that me and my friend could come to terms and enjoy each others point of view.  Thanks"
For those that use CDJ's - do you look at the BPM of your incoming track (either because hard to miss on the display or you want to make sure its not too far off from the current track) and then from there tempo match by ear or do you not look at the BPM of the incoming track and then tempo match as this is a purer way of doing it?

"hello everyone. I have had my DJM v10 since 2020 and I recently noticed that when using effects and turning the level/depth knob, whatever effect I am using cuts in and out.  

In observing it more and more, I noticed that the effect only cuts out when the knob itself is moved or forced in a downward direction. If I hold it an upward direction while I turn the knob,  the effects have no issue working.  I am guessing something has to be re soldered?  

I haven't found this issue described anywhere else and just thought id put this out there to help determine if this could potentially be an easy fix if i open it up myself or does it sound serious enough to send out for repaid at my certified retailer?

"Isn't all dance music just selling drugs through the vibes the government is trying to get you to feel? Is there actual product/market fit that is driven by DJs?

Like what's happening to clubs and shows and festivals set up specifically for dancing and selling drugs and alcohol? Is there just too much music? Is the dance vibe just about discovery being mostly through listening in regular life and so we don't have an association with ""dance music"" as such anymore? Is it too many sober people on the dance floor? Too much familiarity with tictoc short form djs and big house drops? 

I wanted to ask analytic type DJs about norm violation in dance music and the whole social psychology of 4 on the floor in the future of dance music. Where is this going except to sell a vibe you're suppose to have? Is there a way out? Can anyone escape the diffusion into a million genres and the monotony of choosing to play whatever is made predictable by corporations? 

Just killing some time, hoping to be proven wrong about Overmono-type music, looking for recommendations on the future of dance music as dance music rather than elsewhere....

--

Watching people from the Overmono boiler room set made me think structual complexity in house music or other genres is not going to be a crowd pleaser until it is because it was defined that way by marketing machines and big money driving culture through repetition.

Difficulty in predicting the transitions, or the thematic vocal driving the vibe, or never getting to a drop, or even the awkward beat structure is as uncomfortable as Jazz progressions that never resolve to tonics. 

Just as a first listen through to Overmono's work, it seems like the exact opposite of dancefloor vibes, even if it is house music or danceable whatever-genre. But look at the dancers in the crowd reacting to transitions. 

I get listening to them in a different context, having them played to add a vibe to a room where you're not focused on dancing, having them on in the car, or putting headphones on and walking around. It's stylistically appealing, it's mood music, it's not fully in the foreground or background.

Every time you see people follow along to their anticlimaxs and then become awkward, self-conscious, bored. Then a new vocal comes on and people are comfortable again.

"Starter DJ and Used to do everything by ear and was pretty good, I’d also just randomly play songs I liked even if the transitions sucked. I recently got mixed in key and love how easy it is to see what could work right away, but also feel stuck mixing the same key for 10-15 min. I find someone would get bored of hearing the same key, especially with dubstep it seems harder to go around the wheel as most songs are in 2a, 7a and 12a. 
How long do you guys stay in a certain key for your sets? Curious to know. "

Pretty bummed out right now- had a gig few hours ago and the decorations caught fire and it spread like crazy. I ram outside with my MacBook but didn’t have time to protect my controller. Before running out, I disconnected it from the power supply though.

Is there anything that can be done to it? Or is it pretty much done and dusted?

"I've been thinking about this for a few years now and I am curious if anyone has too. It seems like a pretty obvious thing to me.

Wouldn't it be amazing if pioneer/alphateta/whatever released a controller that is basically just one deck off of a ddj1000/flx1000? So you can take those and add them as 3d &amp; 4th decks to your ddj1000/flx10 and have a full ddj1000/flx10 4 physical decks controller setup with a laptop. Or add a few to a djm mixer to have the same thing with a laptop while using the djm soundcard. Something similar to a denon's LC6000. I believe the technology is obviously already here. You just need to cut one deck off of a ddj1000/flx10 and have it as a single midi controller. 

I understand that this might damage the cdjs sales, but if I am buying a set of 3000s, for sure I will be using them fully and not just as a glorified controller. They are so much more than just a MIDI keyboard and with a pricetag to fit it too. And from what I've seen in the dj space I believe many people think the same way. So this single deck midi controller would fit in a currently empty market niche (only Denon has something like this with the lc6000. The traktor x1 is different). So if they release a single deck midi controller in the style of ddj1000/flx10 I think it will be a huge hit imo. It will start making the controller market modular and will open the possibility of many new configurations between the already existing gear. 

Let me know what you think. Does it sound like a good idea to you or complete bs? If you agree share your thoughts on would pioneer even want to release such a product. "

My partner is a DJ. I handle a lot of the backend stuff for him, accounting, website, promo, socials etc. I gig with him often as an assistant/under. He got a gig in Providence at a newish restaurant/lounge in a weird spot off the main strip. Owner hired him for karaoke and to play music between performances every Thursday night. Agreed to pay his fee, said he was gonna make a flyer, promote etc and said he expected it to be slow in the beginning. Partner discussed cash in hand same night for pay. Owner wants to start right away. 

First week is dead. We did our best with promo but the lounge didn’t promote and didn’t want us to make a flyer. owner asks if he can pay half the fee since it was dead… acknowledges the bad weather was a factor whatever. Partner accepts half as goodwill for a regular gig. 

We finally get a flyer and promote all week as best we can but we don’t pay for ads for businesses giving us a flat fee especially for karaoke so it’s all organic. We do invest in our promotion for our own organized gigs which have great turnout. But it’s for mixing sets and the crowd that likes my partner like to dance. Lounge once again doesn’t promote. Thursday comes, owner starts texting asking how many people are coming. My partner says he got about 30 responses to the fb event he made and he’s been promoting all week but it’s another bad weather night (highly walkable area with little parking - bad weather kills foot traffic especially since this place is off the beaten path). Owner says he personally invited 50 people. Cool. Partner asks why owner isn’t promoting on socials. Owner says they posted once on their story… and won’t share our posts because of the “ghetto” music on one of them (black eyed peas for those wondering… 🙄)

This thursday had like 15 people. Owner acts cool and tells my partner it’s the weather, yada yada no big deal. But at the end of the night says I’ll pay you at 10 am tomorrow. My partner was hesitant but agreed because the owner seems so sincere. Told him to call at 10 am and he would cashapp him. 

10 came and went the guy won’t answer the phone or texts. Every couple hours sends us a short text saying he is gonna call basically dicking us around all day. Finally around 3 sends a voice message saying he wasn’t gonna pay us our full fee again (will only pay half) because my partner didn’t bring enough people in, and he will get the payment taken care of but he wants to “see what you can bring to the table next week”. He never sent the money. Big surprise. Not sure if he seriously thinks we are going to continue a business relationship with him. 

I’m just so sick of these business owners conflating club promoters and DJs. Yes we do promotion but ur paying us to play music. They want us to have viral tik tok levels of followers and reach and make the establishment blow up overnight. For karaoke. And then he can’t even pay the agreed fee or do his own bare minimum promotion. 🤡 Now the whole gig is shitcanned 2 weeks in (for us, anyway). 

I know there’s nothing to really be done about this situation other than not work with this guy anymore but he sucks and I wanted to vent with some people who can relate to the frustration. If I had been with my partner on this night I would not have agreed to the delayed payment. If they don’t have the money that night chances are you aren’t getting paid. In my experience. We’ve run into this situation several times throughout the years and if we are together and in person we can usually get paid with a little pressure. I couldn’t fathom hiring someone for a gig (and we do put people on to work door for our self-organized events) and then not paying them for showing up and doing their job because I wasn’t happy with the turnout. We always pay our people. 

TLDR; Providence lounge owner stiffed us for a karaoke gig due to lack of attendance, despite not promoting their own event and expecting us to do all the leg work. "

"So it's almost [world backup day](https://www.worldbackupday.com/en) (probably is in some parts of the world) so here's a reminder to go back up your music library. I might be saying this because something happened to me and not just because it's (almost) world backup day; see the note at the bottom.

Follow the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies of your data, on 2 different media, with 1 stored offsite.

My backups personally look like this:

\- 2 external SSD's which are mirrors which I carry to gigs (this satisfies the 2 different media rule)

\- 1 copy on my server at home (this satisfies the 3 copies part, as well as 2 different media in a slightly different way)

\- 1 copy in the cloud (I use Backblaze which this is *not* an advertisement for, there's lots of good options, this is just what I use! This satisfies the 1 offsite copy.)

This is a touch excessive, I know, but it has saved my butt more than once.

And actually, here's an extra tidbit: if you have the ability to *version* your backups, do so. I haven't paid for the versioned edition of Backblaze, but now I'm kinda sad as I realized that my Serato library has been corrupt for some time (missing a bunch of files). I've narrowed that down to about September of last year when I was having some serious drive issues, but I don't have a backup from then to be able to try to merge with my existing library.

Anyway, back up your stuff!"

I was today years old when I remembered that Serato automatically overwrites your latest recording if you don’t rename it in the ‘Recordings temp’ folder. Lost a 55 min mix. Why don’t they allow it!!
"hi everyone, i've checked older posts but didn't find a convincing answer so i need your help to find the best setup to safely record our hybrid dj/live mixes from the widest range of mixers found in clubs.

home setup is Xone 92 + XDJ1000 + MC101 or TR8 + TB3, when playing in clubs the mixer is usually Xone 92/96 but we came across any kind of device, from Pioneer V10 to Xone 23 or rotary mixers. reading older posts, budget mobile recorders such as Tascam DR-05X seem the best choice, as they can record into SD card from the external line input and have a decent battery life.

so first basic question is whether we should connect the device to Rec or Booth output on the mixer, and if one of them could allow us to use a standard preset on the recording device without needing to check the audio file each time for clipping.

i've compared the specifications for few commonly found mixers of all price tags (Xone 23/92/96 and Pioneer 450/850/V10) and seems the nominal Rec output has a smaller range when comparing the different models. it stands around -8dBu for all of them except for 23 and 450 (the first one having 0dBu and the second one not having a Rec output at all). Booth output ranges instead from -2dBu on Xone 23/92 up to +6dBu on expensive Pioneer models. so my basic knowledge of the subject tells me the Rec output is the best choice here. if there's something i'm missing please tell me (probably something about nominal/max output or dBu/dBV).

this said, Tascam DR-05X has a maximum input level of -4dBV so i should be able to set its Line input to roughly -6/-15dBV and stay safe while recording mixes on different models, without the need to check specifications for Rec output on each mixer that we come across. in any case, a quick post production will be necessary, at least to give some gain as the audio files will come out at different volumes depending on the mixer we used, but that's not a problem. i just want to make sure that there's no chance of clipping, Logic will do the rest.

so why should i need an attenuator if my conclusions are somehow correct? i'm kind of missing the point of it, and what's the difference with a good quality shielded RCA cable combined with the correct input setup on the Tascam.

last short questions, is there any reason to invest some additional money into mid range models, such as DR-40X or Zoom H4n, or maybe wait to find a second hand deal? i don't care too much about field recording or 4 tracks splitting so is there any better feature for the external line input (less distortions or whatever)?

last one for real, any chance i can connect the Tascam directly to a Mixars STA turntable to sample some vinyl? no Rec, just Line out so i guess the output will be way stronger (could be around +50 dBV if my doubtful conversion isn't too bad). there's no GND on this turntable so i don't need a wire, but i can imagine that's way too much for the Tascam so i will have to go through a mixer.

Hello!

I've been DJing for over 10 years, and I've always been interested in musical keys for my mixes. They bring coherence to all the sets I create. Up until now, I've always used the classic referencing method, but then I discovered Alphanumeric and Kamelot's wheel.

For those who aren't familiar, there are plenty of resources on YouTube on the subject.

My question is: What do you use? Classic or Alphanumeric?

Also, what are, for you, the best key combinations that might not seem logical but sound good together?

I've never learned music other than through DJing, so sorry if I offend the purists; I'm just trying to do my best.

"So basicly i was cleaning a room in my house filled with  old stuff and found this, i guess this was from my father, when he was young he used to DJ in lots of clubs, i want to know how do i turn these on to check if it still works, maybe i could sell, what cautions should i take?"

"Ok so I’ve got the following vinyl setup at home - I’m running Ortofon Concorde MK2 MIX carts, on two tech 12’s mk2 and I’ve been running those into a djm-400 mixer. The mixer runs out to a pair of Klipsch The Fives and a relatively cheap sub that sounds great in my smaller room. 

All in all it’s a fantastic setup and I’m very happy with how it sounds.

It doubles as a mixing setup as well as a hi-fi listening set up. Lately I’ve been really enjoying jazz and doing a lot of listening and collecting vinyl, buying particular pressings and really zoning in on the specific listening experience of each pressing. 

With this being said I’m aware that the weakest link sound wise in my set up is the DJM mixer and I found a XONE 32 mixer for cheap on marketplace that I’m going to go check out this evening. 

I know that the A&amp;H mixers are known for great sound and that they are fully analog and I’m looking forward to making the switch. I’m wondering though if I could tap this community for some anectdotes before I pull the trigger. How much better will the new analog Xone mixer actually sound based on the set up I’ve got? 

TLDR buying a xone 32 to replace my djm-400 and wondering how much better it will actually sound?"
"I don’t know if it’s a Mandela effect but I could of sworn  I’d say 2009 there were radios that had people scratching to 80s music like the cover girls, Cynthia ,Johnny 0 ,Stevie b etc it was one of the main factors of why I love the sound but can’t find anything to it I just remember the main thing was scratching and 80s music in it"
"hey sup! i want to use ableton link so i can use my launchpad and akai mini mpk while djing with rekordbox. the main issue is that my DJ controller (DDJ-FLX6) only has RCA output. so i thought about setting ableton output to my focusrite scarlet solo, then routing the scarlett Line Output to a yamaha AG06 mixer to channel 1. then routing the ddj-flx6 RCA to the yamaha channel with rca input. and yamaha output to speakers through XLR. in theory it should work, should i buy the yamaha mixer? looks perfect for this task!. i'll use the akai mpk knobs to EQ ableton master output scince i can't EQ with the yamaha mixer."
""
"Looking for something budget friendly that has xlr outputs and another send for a monitor preferably though even a headphone output would do for that as I’ll take my cans out of my Traktor controller, have scoured the internet but anything I find seems to be too bulky/pricey for my needs and anything small seems to only have jack outputs! Any help much appreciated!"
"Starting Over. Recently quit drinking... Changing my life around. Getting back into DJing/producing. Don't know shit about new technology. My old rig in the photo.

Definitely getting some new Turntables (work tables). Need a new mixer/controller. I need the hole 9 yards. I have a budget of 10k, to get me started. I need everything. My XONE :62 is still a beast.

My sound is a mix of trance, organic house, folktronica, dnb, with a splash of shrooms. I like to layer tracks heavily. Not into scratching. I don't want to press a bunch of buttons with stupid noises. I just want my vinyl to work along side my digital music and I want to be able to extremely refine the sound. I want the dopest mixer for that. 

Can someone break down what I need?"
"I just got a pair. Sound quality is really nice, and for at home they seem good but there is a lot of bleed from my speakers so im kinda scared the will be shit on stage. 
Had the aiaiai tma 2 dj before and never had monitoring issues in my life so idk if its an upgrade. 
Wanted to ask before i take them on stage and maybe not be able to give them back. "
"Mixing some liquid DnB yesterday (DDJ 1000, windows laptop with 16Gb ram that I've never had issues with)

There was 1 track in the playlist that would just not harmonically sit with any other tune, so I tried the Key Sync literally for the first ever time... Mix sounded decent, for a key manipulation, but when tune A ended and I pressed the Cue button tune B instantly jumped to 344 BPM!!! 😳😳😂

I was recording and 40 mins in so I thought I'd re-do, so re-loaded tune B to the deck to get back to 172 BPM, skipped back a ways on tune A and then noticed it was playing at 86 BPM!

What the actual frick is up with that??? Had to re-load both tunes back to the decks to get them back to the BPM they should be at"
"I'm looking to get back into DJing after years of not having time. I'm looking for something that feels as close to vinyl as possible. I had turntables years ago when I first learned and then also had Numark CDXs later. I liked them because it felt close enough to vinyl for me. 

What I'm trying to do: 
Mix and scratch hip-hop at home. 

What I need: 
Large jogwheels
Responsive feel for scratching. Preferably as close to vinyl as possible. 

What I would like to have:
Motorized platters

Don't need:
4 deck capability 

I've looked at the Hercules Inpulse T7. It honestly looks like it checks the boxes of what I want and need. I'm not familiar with recent Hercules stuff, only from years ago when it was basically looked at like toys. 

I'd like to stay below $800. In all honesty I'd like to be closer to $500-600 max if possible. I've found the T7 for about $600. Unless I've missed it I haven't really found anything else with motorized platters in that range. 

Anyone have the T7 and do a lot of scratching? How has it been? Would you recommend it? Anything else that I'm missing that would be a better option? Any help is appreciated! "
"I know this is maybe a bit of a niche ask, but is anyone aware of a tool that can compare a Spotify playlist to a playlist on my laptop and tell me what tracks are missing? 

I use Spotify when I’m on the go to build playlists and then I download the tracks and put them into Apple Music, then sync to each of the different dj softwares I need (Primarily Rekordbox and Engine). Sometimes though I miss tracks, or add another track later, or my budget prevents me getting every track on the playlist, so the playlists on Spotify maybe don’t necessarily match the ones I have locally. 

Is there any tool I can use to compare my Spotify playlists to what is on my local apply music, Rekordbox or Engine? I just want it to tell me what is missing. 

Note - I’m not interested in migrating playlists to Apple Music, I know that’s a thing already, but doesn’t help me because I can’t use them for DJ’ing. "
"Hoping to get input on buying a used Roland DJ 808 in 2024. I know it’s a little dated when you think of the number of controllers that have been released since 2016, but my focus has been making beats for awhile now and the dj808 seems to be the best tool for the producer-DJ. I imagine I can sketch out beats from loops on serato and connect to my drum machine or use the 808 section to layer drums. There’s no other DJ hardware with a midi out. I’ve also seen my two favorite producers use it up to even recently (Pete Rock and Alchemist), which shouldn’t matter but heck, I want to emulate my idols. 

My main concerns for the DJ 808 are that 1) it’s discontinued by Roland so finding replacement parts might be a hassle, 2) it’s not built like a brick (also considering a Rane One, which is a tank), 3) the producer set up I imagine will end up being too complicated to sketch out beats and I’m left with useless features (I like gorilla beat making on my sp-404)

The reason why the Rane One is appealing to me is because I imagine being more comfortable with it DJing at say a backyard function. It’s minimal, would be more natural for me to scratch with (used to use turntables for DJing way back when), and has a solid build for mobile use. For beat-making, it has an AUX in which is minimally all I need to sketch a beat out. 

TLDR: get the DJ 808 for its producing features even though it’s discontinued, or get something new and not worry about the producing aspect.

"I currently have a motu 2 on my pc running to two hs7s and a studio sub.  I'm trying to run my controller to the same speakers (not through my pc audio, so I can use cue audio in headphones)  
I'm looking at getting a pair of small PA speakers.  The new speakers will have 2 inputs per speaker, and a single output.  My sub has two inputs and outputs ( R &amp; L channels)   
Is there a way I can run both my PC/interface AND my DJ controller (traktor s4 mk3) through both speakers and the sub?  
I'm not sure why I'm struggling with this, but in my head, it seems like the only way I can get it to work, I'd have to choose between having the sub on my interface audio or my dj audio.  


Any help would be appreciated. Sorry for being a dingus"
"Hi everyone,

Reciently I purchased for a second hand Xone 42 with a very nice look aspect and functionally everything seems to work well.

But...there is something that is driving me crazy... I ussually play with headphones (no monitors) at home by volume and neighbors...and for me it´s very important using continuously the cue/mix knob in order to beatmach the fader down channel with fader up channel and mix both channels precueing in live mode.

Well it´s normal for everyone, but...when I received this mixer, I took account that..if I have channel A with fadder up..it is being listened in mix ..ok everything ok, but, If I have the channel B playing but with FADER DOWN AND CUE selected, it also is being listened with knob turned to MIX completly!!

It has no sense for me! because I lose track of what is sounding outside and inside.

Is it a normal function of this mixer? or it´s wrong??? because I see a lot of djs (some time ago) playing with this mixer at home with no issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much for your support and answers!"
"Hello Reddit this is my first post. I found a very interesting specimen. I am not a professional career DJ but I do have some experience, played along some relatively big names. So I think I am knowledgeable enough to have a little discussion. Now I met this guy, probably a troll, that pretends to be a Radio DJ in the Uk. He’s apparently playing 8 decks at once, loves to sync, is shitposting while on air for the whole uk, he loves to mix basslines and if things get tricky -&gt; b2b! Besides that all his sets are behind paywalls, something I also never heard of. 

The discussion began around why the sync button can be dangerous, for example when rekordbox did not properly analyse the track, placing the grid incorrectly. Happened to me more than once when I started playing on proper equipment and tried to save a messed up transitions with the sync button, which made it even worse. I also think playing manually keeps the spirit of djing and keeps you aware and on your toes, helps you not overdoing your mix. 

I will post some citations and invite you all to make fun of it and feel free to elaborate why the things said are complete bullshit 

Enjoy: 

„ Had 8 decks on the flow yesterday, all in turn. Synced now and then to bring them in, when things turned tricky. B2B.“

„ you have no idea. Being able to sync now makes you able to bring other parts of the music in as opposed to keeping your fingers on the vinyl to keep synced. It's opened things up but of course you obviously wouldn't know ;)“ 

This one is interesting he is able to use the sync button on vinyls

„If you can't mix a bass line, that shows how shit you are. That's EXACTLY what you should be doing. Fuck me

I make bass lines sound good together. That's the difference between me and you ;)“ 

Obviously most electronic music has to heavy bass to properly mix it, and it’s usually clear that the transition point sits where the new bass line is introduced. I think that applies to techno, house, dnb, hardcore and hip hop. But the hero here is better than all of us.

„ 6 decks, two rooms.; the main and the chill out. (two rooms and yet you probably think you're good with two decks whilst not getting paid). All broadcast at the same time. Bitch thinks she knows shit XD on pathetic equipment. Better yourself.“ 

He claims to play two sets at once 

An absolute god on Earth.

Let me know what you think about it guys, I hope you find this as hilarious as I do"

I would like to know about the best settings for platinum notes in multiband expansion as well as multi band compression
"I feel like I somewhat shut down, focus too much on the fact people aren’t dancing to be able to put all my attention into what to play next. Any ideas on how to ease the thought and terror that no one is dancing. (I’ve only been opening by the way, and I’m expecting people to at LEAST groove)"
"I see it all the time. Where djs have their entire set figured out before they even arrive at the club. Without going into my opinion on that too deeply, I will provide some ways I have used over the years to always be able to improvise my sets. A very rewarding feeling to be able to adjust what I am doing to what I see on the floor and have it work. Whereas if I had it all planned out and saw my idea fall flat, what then?

1. Organize your music library based on the vibes you play. Inside my House folder I have playlists. !House\_All is where everything goes no matter what. ""-bpm"" playlist is for tracks that are slower than 120bpm. ""+bpm"" is for tracks above 130bpm. Another separate playlist for every subgenre of house I mess with. Whenever a new track is added to my collection I simply drag a copy of the track to every applicable playlist. I also have playlists dedicated to energy levels. A playlist called ""early glow"" for music that would get people dancing if they are not, but not in a pushy way. Traktor users who know about preparation playlists can gets tons of mileage organizing their music using them almost like a cheat code. 
2. For a gig, make a playlist adding way more music than you expect to have time to play. Practice sets with the playlist and don't adhere to an order. Hopefully the playlist has changes in energy levels from one song to another. So now it's on you to match those with what you see on the dance floor in realtime.

Just keeping a couple habits like this has allowed me to improvise every set I have played. I can switch out of my gig playlist to another that matches a vibe the crowd latches onto very quickly without much thought. So I am not rummaging through a large collection and having that take too much time."
"i noticed this a lot in the last sets i have watched, i know layering tracks helps to keep up the tempo of the tracks and makes it easier to chop in and out for an interesting mix 
BUT i feel like the magic of a lot of tracks is lost by that, what neuro makes so special for me are the sinister vibes and frightening build ups, i love double and triple drops but for my taste it is done a bit too much as neurofunk as a genre itself already has a loud and powerful sound
Any opinions on that? "

"I'm fairly sure I know the typical use-cases for 4 decks, I'm just kind of bored and wanted to hear if there are varying ways Dubstep DJ's use 4 decks.  


Not asking ""how do I use 4 decks"", just wondering how \*you\* personally do it."
"Hi all my issue with phase essential is when I let my deck gradually slow say I switch the power off on the technic deck one of my phase sticks acts just like vinyl would,gradually  letting the music get slower and slower until it stops but the other one slows down then before it comes to a stop it stops the music abruptly before the deck even stops spinning making it sound awful. Everything fully updated using serato on imac. Tried a full reset and reinstalled all latest drivers. Anyone had this or know what it could be??"
This rings all of my scam bells in my head if I could get a second opinion I’d appreciate!

"Looking for input from DJs with 15k+ tracks.

What are you using to backup? Multiple HDD/SDD, Cloud? How often do you do it, how much do you pay per year?

I use a 2&amp;1 strategy (2 physical &amp; 1 offsite, cloud) so 2-3 SSDs and a 1 remote cloud provider at the moment. I'm just curious what other folks might use"
"Just wondering about what the best way is to get creative with layering when using CDJ type of players? Is this always done via extra decks (a few k $$$ for an extra loop just doesn't seem like the most efficeient way)? I guess this would give the most control for key shifting, EQing, looping, etc. Or do people generally use the sample function of these standalone players? I'm talking about added percussion loops in an afro house set or extra hat loops in a techno set, etc.

I have a drum machine also (analog rytm) that I can hook up to my mixer and do stuff there but then its another piece of gear to worry about so to say. Just wondering what is the usual way with higher end setups. Thanks"
"I had used it just that morning before I unplugged evertything from it and packed all my gear in the car. Got to the bar, got all my gear setup, but since I got there early, I failed to power everything on until it was time for me to play. That was a mistake. I had this issue once before, and since I live less than a mile from the venue, I took the controller, cables and computer home for testing and it powered up just fine. At the time, I chalked it up to operator error (I figured I didn't seat the power or USB cable properly). But yesterday, I did the same thing and it would not power on despite trying different cables.

I think it's a hardware issue and I'm pissed at the design of the power adapter plug into the unit. I learned it's not good for consistent gigging aka constant plugging/unpluging of the power adapter. I've owned it since April of 2020 and despite the one hiccup last year. Since June of last year, I've used it in the wild - meaning I've had to plug/unplug it at least once a month to bring it to the bar.

Now, I'm looking at a XDJ-XZ or XDJ-RX3. I'd love to get a couple XDJ-1000mk2's and a DJM-750mk2, but since I'm trying to save for a home in the future, I can't really justify the cost of the modular setup. I do plan to eventually send the DDJ-1000 for repair. I hope it can be repaired because I'd like to use it as a backup. Lesson learned: HAVE A BACKUP IF YOU'RE GIGGING!

I'd LOVE to have a modular setup, but currently, I'm only playing the bar, streaming on Twitch, recording mixes a few times a year, and just mixing for fun whenever… And if I start getting back to playing venues/events/clubs, I would probably be booked via a promoter, so they should have the pro gear (DJM-900nxs2/CDJ-3000s/etc.), so I just show up with my headphones and USB drives. I like having a 4-channel setup of the XZ but the RX3 seems more portable and has a much better screen - it's also $400 cheaper than the XZ. If I were to get the XZ, I would probably never get a modular system until the XZ dies lol.

Anyway, this long-ass post was to vent my frustration and any advice/suggestions would be great."

"I've been a big fan of Bandcamp for a while, especially for its music discovery and digging capabilities. However, I noticed that they've removed the ability to use and follow tags, which was a bit of a shock. These features were crucial for finding new music and keeping up with specific genres or artists.

I remember reading an article mentioning that Bandcamp is working on bringing some features back or improving the discovery process, but details were a bit vague. Does anyone know if there's a timeline for when these features might return? It's been a bit frustrating trying to navigate through the platform without them.

Also, I can't help but wonder about the decision-making process behind removing such key features. It seemed like Bandcamp was on a good path toward enhancing music discovery. If anyone has insights or updates on this, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Thanks in advance for any info you might have!"

"Hey friends, used to be an old turntable dj back in teh late 90's/early 00s and retired for about 15 years.  Long story short I've returned to the scene and have been working hard the last year to get caught up with the new techniques and equipment and one thing seems to be tripping me up a little more than I would expect... collection.

Back in the day it was easy to keep things organized because you had a couple record crates and could keep things visually how you needed them.  That and long blends and longer songs were more common so you played less songs so you didn't need a huge collection.

So I've got things pretty trim, as I do multiple kinds of gigs so it's easy to keep a playlist of ""corporate gigs"" and ""X genre"" type of things... but I also have been getting attention and gigs for my actual harder funky DJ stuff that I did back in the day.  I used to show up to multiple Open Decks in a week with a USB of 100 songs I knew I wanted to highlight and just freestyled... but now that I'm getting full sets booked, I worry that there will be too much overlapping and that anyone who sees me will hear 25% of my ""keepers"" on any given gig if I just stick to 100-ish tracks.  Granted that 100 will be refined as I hear new stuff I want to play, but still there will obviously be my favorites on that stick.

So my question for established DJs who book regular club gigs and EDM gigs (not laptop driven multi-hour wedding or corporate gigs)...  Even if your collection is 1000+ songs... how many do you take to a typical gig and do you just expect that people will hear a few of the same tracks if they come out and support you often?  ESPECIALLY if you're known for playing a specific type of EDM?"

"I got to the conclusion that iTunes is the best way for me to keep the music organized. And I have been doing it for some quite time (few years). I'm not preforming a lot, but every 2-3 months I have something. Throughout the years I have encountered various problems with the system that I want to overcome.

1. My library is on external hard drive and I'm using MacOS. I had few times that I needed to change my computer to a new one. What I usually do is to just drag and drop the files into iTunes and then recreate the smart-playlists that I had, as well as playlists that I created (usually sets that I preformed / recorded). The thing is that the to recreate the smart-playlists is an annoying process which I need to remember the rules. What is the best way to overcome this? is there a way the library structure and playlist could be kept, so when I switch computer one day I can be sure that it will be an instant thing?
2. When I export in rekordbox I do it from iTuens API, I don't drag into rekordbox. What is the safest way to make sure I won't lose cue points that I set into Rekordbox? "
"This is probably a super noob/dumb question but thought I’d ask her before making a purchase, but I just bought a used technics 1200 mk2 &amp; tried plugging it directly into my xone 96 but the sound coming is super low, had to boost the whole channel to hear barely anything. My guess is I need to buy a phono pre amp to connect it there and then connect it over to my xone 96 or should it be able to work directly without a pre amp &amp; there might wrong with the technics itself?

"Let me just say, I’m a new DJ. I just started DJing my college bar and I tend to get super anxious before going on. Today I decided to livestream UMF to get some inspiration before my set I just had. One thing that really calmed me down was seeing the DJs I look up to fuck up. I know that sounds kinda bad but my biggest fear DJing is of course fucking up. And I fucked up tonight, quite a few times. Yet every time it happened the crowd was supportive. They still loved what I was doing despite the fuck ups. Just as it is with the big name DJs like Steve Aoki (he majorly fucked up today and he handled it like a champ). Anyways I just wanted to say that while my favorite DJs inspire me because they’re so good, they also inspire me because they fuck up, just as I do. And it doesn’t matter. Sending love to all of you"

"Hello fellow disc jockeys/knob touchers -

I’ve been DJing for over 7 years now and began working professionally 2.5 years ago. One of the biggest challenges I’ve encountered is the constant disruption to my sleep cycles. 

Since beginning my 8-5, I’ve typically gone to bed around 10 on weeknights. Then the weekend rolls around and I’m up til 3am both Friday and Saturday. I then struggle to sleep past 9ish AM even if I’m exhausted because of my week schedule.

Folks in similar predicaments - what do you do to ease the stress on your bodies from throwing off your sleep schedule every weekend? I get sick pretty often and I believe it’s directly correlated to this issue.

Thank you all!

I'm not mad! Rare Serato W maybe that's why I haven't seen anyone post about it.😂 The past couple months I've been hoarding all the cds that were in my tidal library just to get this back smh. Who wants some old hip hop cds??😂😂
"So I trip out sometimes how like well known artists and DJs don't have as many viewers on Twitch or Youtube as some no name DJ that we've never heard of. For instance, Lord Finesse streams every Saturday AM. He has like 300 - 400 people in his chat, and he's work with the likes of Big L, DJ Premier, and other well known people in hip hop. He's part of D.I.T.C and has a long history in music. But another unknown DJ I'll catch on Twitch has like 1k+ people watching him DJ. Same thing with Easy Mo Bee. He streams on Twitch late at night on Friday nights and Saturday nights, but he doesn't get many viewers from what I've seen. That guy has worked with Notorious BIG and many other well known artists.

There's other examples of that, so I was wondering like what gets you an audience on Twitch or Youtube? Are these no name guys just marketing and advertising their stream on social media more/better or what? What do you guys/gals think about it? Peace and stay up!"
"I had the chance to visit DJ Harvey’s magnum opus club last night, called Klymax Discoteque. Paul Woodford was playing all night long. 

The place is an absolute dream of a venue. Kind of a hidden entrance on the side of a hill, with not a trace of sound coming out of it. Then you enter through the reception, down a flight of stairs and into this incredibly curated, beautifully crafted dream of a club environment. 

Sprung wooden dance floors, no tables for bottle service, mind blowing, crystal clear 4 point speaker system, discrete DJ booth tucked away in the wall above the dance floor, beautiful haze and elegant, minimal lighting. Just the crème of the crop for the kind of eyes closed, pure sound dancing experience a lot of us crave and grew up on. 

The problem was the crowd. The vibes were shit, at least for the couple of hours we were there. Paul Woolford is an absolute god and the music was incredibly on point, the venue was divine, but most of the crowd had this kind of Uber hipster, too cool for school, fashionista attitude that just sucked. No passion, no energy, no commitment, as the meme goes. 

I could have closed my eyes and just jammed in this womb of pure sound and still had a great time, but my friends were really not feeling it so we ended up leaving around 2 and going somewhere else (which was a disappoint to me but we were a big group so wanted everyone to feel comfortable). 

I’m by far the most purist and experienced raver in the group, and this place is designed especially for people like me. So it could just be my friend’s attitudes sucked, but the truth is the vibe of the rest of the crowd was pretty lame too. 

Has anyone else visited and had a different experience? Maybe it was just an off night or my friend’s shitty attitude couldn’t appreciate it or coloured my experience? Does the crowd ever really pop off and go wild, doing justice to the love and care of Harvey and the designers of this incredible gem?

Just curious if anyone else has had an experience of this, because crowd last night aside, it’s pretty much the closest thing to perfect I’ve ever seen. 

Hopefully I can go again tonight to see Chaos in the CBD and maybe the vibes and crowd will be different. It’s definitely an aficionado’s paradise, just seemed to be too few aficionados and too may posers / cool kids there when I visited last night. 

Hope I’m wrong because the world needs more of Klymax style purist places, not less! "
"First 2 are classics I cant believe I fell for:

ALWAYS have a backup laptop

NEVER update 2 days before a gig

the crowd doesn't really care at all as long as there's any music playing (Sofyware keeps crashing? just DJ the files raw thru a media player)

If you're very tall, point that out to the organizer so they'll get you a fitting table to set up on - will save you a lot of lower back pain

When asking someone for a slice of pizza midset, don't say ""I don't mind the topping"" that's how you end up with pineapple pizza

"Hi gang,
A while back I sold my Reloop RP8000 MK2's and I regret it.
Recently I decided I want to digitalise you vinyl collection but I don't have the budget to shell out for a technics 1210 or another Reloop. I liked the Pioneer plx-500 but I heard they have motor/platter issues so now I'm searching again. 
I have a budget of €300 to €600. 
What can you recommend that's direct drive, similar to either a Reloop or Technics in features but with a more budget friendly price?
Thanks in advance."
"Hi all

Looking for some advice on the best way to go about recording some of my records with my current setup for use at gigs. I do buy digital copies of everything i can get hold of online, or buy the tracks on CD &amp; rip if there is a cd release available. Some of my older music, white labels etc ive not been able to find so would like to rip them from wax. Setup is as follows -

Pioneer XDJ-XZ
2 x Reloop RP7000 Mk2
Reloop Concorde carts &amp; stylii (i believe they are just rebadged Ortofon Pro S Mk1)
Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 3rd gen interface
Macbook Pro Mid 2012 &amp; MSI Windows gaming laptop with Serato Dj Pro, Ableton, Garageband &amp; Audacity
2 x 'classic' Technics-style headshells with Stanton 500 carts (i dont think the stylii are genuine Stanton, most probably copies)

Ive tried recording direct from vinyl to USB stick on the XZ &amp; it sounds ok, not sure how well the recordings will hold up next to 'new' digital wav's &amp; mp3's on a big system. I'm using the turntables thru the 'Line' inputs on the XZ as they have line-level output as well as phono (presuming line level is the way to go as Pioneer's phono pre-amps seem to be regarded as poor).

Have also tried recording through the Scarlett to computer &amp; to me the recordings sounded a lot more 'flat' &amp; quieter than direct to USB.

There's so much info online about this its pretty overwhelming, most of it from 'audiophile' types rather than gigging dj's. Should i buy a vinyl cleaning machine? What cart &amp; stylus to use? Do i need an expensive phono pre-amp? Cork or rubber turntable mats? So much info i just dunno where to start 😵‍💫

Would be nice to get some ideas from working dj's who have had decent results playing vinyl rips alongside digital downloads on club systems.

I play House/Garage/UKG so decent bass &amp; crisp vocals from the recordings are a must. Thanks for reading 👍🏻

"Specifically, what kind of event or venue have you guys experienced where people enjoy some ""background dance music"" (that isn't a club or a rave, and there isn't even a dance floor). I work a day job and I happily sit in my chair and listen to Deep House, Dub-House, Dub-Techno, Minimal, Lounge, etc. ""IDM"" I guess? Maybe? Anyway. It's like 98% 4-on-the-floor kicks but it's pretty chill, no bangers - all ""vibey"" kind of stuff. I'm not dancing. It's not after 10pm. But it's just the music I love, all day, any time, anywhere. I can't be the only one. Just feels like there's got to be a place where people would vibe to that kind of DJ/mix, but I don't know what it is.

Opening night at an art gallery comes to mind. Or some kind of ""afters"" lounge maybe.

Has anyone else had success with making this kind of event work? If so, please share your thoughts.

I just want to fade back into the corner and play a 4-hour set, from like from 8-12pm at a sit-down place where people are chilling, sipping cocktails, the lights are low, the music isn't loud as fuck, but the bass is heavy, the energy is chill and slightly high-end, ya know? Bonus points for couches. All I ask from the audience is a few head bobs here and there as I look out over the room. Maybe a finger gun or two as people walk by to use the restroom. This would be heaven.

I'm happy to seek that out and/or put on my own night someplace, if I could find the right place. Just curious if anyone else has some *kind* of event or venue that comes to mind. Meanwhile, I'll make a couple demo mixes and start a list of possible venues in my town...

Example track with the right feel:

[https://open.spotify.com/track/2cAECJKzJEE4MhjJu7ba7j?si=9cc24847b5bb45f1](https://open.spotify.com/track/2cAECJKzJEE4MhjJu7ba7j?si=9cc24847b5bb45f1)

&amp;#x200B;

So far I'm thinking:

• Art gallery opening night

• Wine bar

• Fancy Cocktail bar

EDIT TO ADD:

• Record Shop

• Pool Party

• Yacht Party

• Rooftop Bar

&amp;#x200B;

What else?"

"I've started up r/deephouse1 if anyone would care to take a look. As a DJ, I feel it's about time the genre has a proper sub, like r/propertechno. The older one has 180k members but posts get little to no interaction and moderation is almost zero.

I know there's a lot of debate around what is and what isn't deep house - I'm not particularly keen on the stuff filling up Beatport etc, but I am happy to be swayed. My only rule is: no EDM.

Come and have a look! Posts some tracks. Debate whether Qwazars is deep house or dub techno... or neither.

It's a work in progress but we all have to start somewhere. Thanks."
"Hey everybody,   
I'm here just for one simple question: which **record store** should I go while staying in **Berlin** to dig for 90's progressive trance, electronic, hard house, proggresive house that kind of old school stuff?   
Thanks in advance!"
"Both local and mainstream. It feels like folks get a couple viral moments and suddenly they feel like a god. I've been at this for 4 years and while I am confident in my skills and abilities, I still feel I have so much to learn and grow. 

Look, I get it - flexing is part of the job, to an extent. You have to be able to show confidence in yourself and in your craft. But it irks me when DJs (especially new ones) feel this certain entitlement to act and speak as if they're the heroes sent down to earth to ""save"" the industry. 

I'm not asking for folks to be humble or meek - I just don't understand the need to be a self-entitled asshole everywhere you go. "
"I'm a new DJ, I have a recently serviced Technics SL-1200MK5 where the pitch fader is very fast when it is centered. Is this something that needs to be calibrated and how involved is that process? Is it easy? Someone please point me in the right direction. "
"Initially when I started DJing and I was focused on building my library. Back then it was about quantity vs quality. Being a beginner back then, I bought into they hype of Platinum Notes 4 and ran what is now my 6000+ track library through it. Recently, I've been seeing the ad to update to PN 10. Naturally, I searched the web to see if the upgrade was worth the cost and came across some previous posts here and in r/DJCircleJerk about how it's likely making my music worse, not better. 

Now that I am more focused on not just the quality of songs I have, but the sound quality as well, my question is: 

1. Did I screw myself over running everything through PN 4?
2. Is it worth it for me to start my library over from scratch?

If I do need to rebuild my library, I plan to do it on a 2nd External SSD and use my current one to gig until I'm able to take the new one out. I just wanted to see if anyone had any insights or similar experiences to share. Any insight would be helpful. "
"Hey guys, I have a question. So I feel like ever since I've progressed from a beginner DJ to an ""intermediate"" DJ I've been at this intermediate level for about three years with no change. My question is, does this happen to everyone? Or what can I do differently in my practice to increase my level. I still feel confident in my skills, but then sometimes I hear other DJs and I go ""damn I need to get like that guy! That guy is talented!""

So my question is this, what can I do differently in practice to take me to the next level? "
"Do you think it's a negative thing or a disadvantage if a DJ doesn't really dance/groove with the music or look like they're not having fun? Sorry if there are already similar posts like this, but I kind of wanted to share a bit more about my personal story. 

I ask this question because that's literally me as a DJ and I'll explain why. First of all, I love DJing and it is one of my happy places whenever I get behind the decks playing to a crowd. However, I'm very shy, introverted, awkward, self-conscious, have social anxiety, probably on the autism spectrum....you name it. I've never been a dancer or ever felt comfortable trying to dance either. 

I've been trying to improve recently, but while DJing I'd mostly be head down with a serious face. One reason for this is because I get laser focused on mixing so it looks like I'm taking an exam or something. At most, I might bob my head a few times here and there and smile when friends or crowd members are into my set and get my attention.

You might ask why do I even DJ? Again, it's one of my happy places and I get lost in the music/mixing even if it appears differently. I feel like DJing is also a way to help me express myself or release some of my emotions through the music I play. Physically, some head bobbing and smiling is probably the best I will ever be able to do. I can't force myself to dance because it comes unnatural. I've accepted it's just who I am and I can't bring myself to fake anything. Overall, I'm ok with all this about myself as a DJ but what are your thoughts? 

What do you think about DJs that don't dance or show much emotion? Are we at a disadvantage? Also, if anyone else is going through something similar...how are you dealing with it? Is it just what it is or are you trying to do something about it.

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any comments."
"I'm going thru a tough time lately. I haven't played any gig in 3 months and it seems like things won't get any better. The reason being - I don't play the music that everyone else is playing

Let me paint the picture for you....So, I'm a DJ and producer from India and have been active in my local scene for 2 years now. I like making &amp; playing house music and really melodic stuff. Recently, I've been offered a full time residence at a bar. The pay is good and I was really considering to take it. But the owner wants me to quit playing what I like and play all the generic bollywood music. 

I really don't like playing those songs and recently it's starting to feel like I'm getting outcasted because of that reason. The scene in my city is really closed off for any newcomer and the only way to get any gigs is by compromising what you love playing and do what the promoter wants you to do. 

I'm really struggling financially and I've now faced with this situation of either giving up on my music or be bullied by the promoters to get whatever gigs they offer me. 
What should I do according to you guys? "

" Saw it on marketplace. I currently have an RX2. I'm playing electronic music in clubs/events sometimes, and I think they would really help me to stay used to CDJ's instead of one screen of a controller.

I am aware of the key differences between nexus 1 and nexus 2 - less hot cues, no beat jump (which is the worst one, I use this a lot if I accidentally get out of phrase), worse sound quality (but does that matter when its for home use only?), no technical support/repair anymore. Also it's without a flight case, but again, doesn't matter since it will be for home use only. But the lowest I've seen complete nexus 2 setup go for is 4400$.

In the future I am very interested in start to mix with even more decks, CDJ's or turntables.

I do feel like I'm well informed, but in general would love some second opinions.

Cheers"
"Hello.

  
To clarify i'm talking about live streaming/broadcasting DJ sets (as opposed to sourcing music from streaming services)

First post. I've been away from Djing for 15 years or more. Started on vinyl around 1990, ended up with a macbook + serato + turntables around 2005? Anyway, I'm getting back into it (with an ipad initially) and I'm interested in live streaming which I didnt even take much notioce of during the pandemic, so to say I'm novice is putting it mildly

Having done some very quick research, I'm wondering about legalities. I understand you can get away with it? But I'd rather do it properly (as a copyright holder I'm not against hobby DJ's being able to live stream and promote music, but on a more professional level rights holders should get paid - but lets not get sidetracked with that debate).

I'm also wondering about live streaming to bars. Most bars should have a license, but also i imagine most major social live streams will shut you down, so thats not gonna work, right? Or wrong? Or nobody cares?

So, legally what are the realities?

Is there a way i can play anything I want it without licensing it individually, directly (not gonna happen obvs)? Any services that provide for this (paying is fine within reason)?

Then again, let's say you go live on the main social platforms, what is the reality of that, not just legally, but technically, mentally etc?



Thanks"

"I am a newbie to the DJ gear world but have a question…

Quick backstory…
I work for an AV integrator we do mostly conference rooms and public access broadcast systems. 

We have a client that we work with a few times a year that builds out  trade show trucks for festivals. 
Think a box truck that is custom branded with added features of the product they are selling and to hand out merchandise at these festivals and trade shows.

We outfit a few of these with speakers and amps connected to a simple multi-channel mixer that is for a local music source and mics. With connections for outside vendors or whatever they want to bring to these festivals. They typically hire local talent to do these events. 

So here is my question…
We have been asked to spec an all in one DJ system for the next truck they are looking at the Pioneer XDJ-XZ or Rane Four. Both are 4 channel units similar feature and support Serrato. However our stance has always been let the talent bring in there gear and connect to the system. We provide xlr, rca and I believe even a usb link. 

Are we totally off base with that line of thinking? If so what would be a system to provide a local DJ for a gig that is typically a day maybe 3?

Thoughts ideas and comments welcome."
"Anyone aware of any offboard, external effects unit that can be used with a DJ mixer that also includes a compressor?

I'm currently on a Xone 96, looking to upgrade my setup for stems and flexible tempos. I'll be mixing older tracks from the 60s and 70s that aren't remasters so the tracks aren't as hot and have more dynamic range, which doesn't work as well for mixing on top of modern dance music.

My solution was to get an RNC1173 compressor to use on a send channel, but now I'm thinking I'd like a whole effects unit that also has a compressor on it.

Ideally it would be designed for DJing but I don't think there are any that include a compressor. Maybe a some kind of live audio mastering unit?"

Fo example I started thanks to the EDM madness on 2012 by watching the Tomorrowland aftermovies and also thanks to Avicii so my dream was to be a EDM dj and nowadays I am mostly multi genre.

A bit different from what I imagined. As soon as some friends and family knew I was djing they started to invite me to birthdays and that type of parties where you don't play what you want but what the crowd wants so I started to build a huge library of all kind of music and I'm actually a good selector and crowd reader so that kind of gives me joy to see people dancing and reacting to I'm doing.

"Hey all, 

So i’m planning on throwing an underground rave / bush doof in some nearby parklands in over a months time. I have some experience in planning and organising events before but none of this scale. I’m planning to have around 500 people there, the event will be outdoors obviously and will involve quite a bit of effort. It will go from about 10pm to sunrise, to give us a chance to clean up while it’s light. 

I’m here to mainly ask about equipment. My friend has XDJ XZ for decks which should be fine as i’m not interested in renting CDJS for this. I have about 5 djs lined up for the night so far and was wondering if a few more would be good or should I have longer sets instead? 

I’m also interested on some advice of sound system and lighting requirements. I’ve lined up 2x QSC KW152 speakers and 4x EV ETX18SP subwoofers which I think should do the trick. 

In terms of lighting, i’m thinking of getting some red / purple wash lighting and an AVE ECLIPSE CLUB 1000MK2 for lasers. The lasers will be slightly angled to avoid them pointing to the sky and endangering air traffic. I’d love some recommendations on specific wash lights that could be suitable for hire for the event. 

The main thing I need advice on is a generator. I’ve constantly been told an inverter is much better in this situation so that’s probably what i’m going to go for. I was just wondering with the above information how much power would the generator need? I’ve been recommended 6000-8000W, would this be ok?

I have a 6x3 Metre gazebo organised to cover the dj and equipment and am going to put 5x 2x2 Metre temporary steel fencing in front of the dj and speakers to protect the equipment from drink spills / other issues. 

I’ve organised a team of around 10+ so far for setup, security, crowd control and medial assistance. 

I’m planning to have about 300+ water bottles available for those in need as this won’t cost too much and i’m sure would be helpful. We have prepared a bunch of garbage bags for the cleanup afterwards and i’m planning to place some temporary bins around the area to try and reduce the inevitable rubbish issue in the first place. 

30 days before the event I’ll create a private instagram account and gatekeep the location until on the day to avoid police presence and unwanted patrons. The location is quite far from houses and I am doing everything in my power to prevent this from being shut down by police and to be a safe and fun night for all. 

That’s about it for now, id really appreciate some recommendations and advice from people with or without experience in this area. 

Apologies for formatting typed on phone, thanks !!

Edit 1 - 
This isn’t an official event, it’s meant for fun and it doesn’t need the most overly loud sound system or excessive catering for guests, they know what they are getting themselves into by attending.

Edit 2 - 
There won’t likely be 500 people there, this is a pure maximum amount, the actual amount will likely be between 100-300."
"I live in a small country town and there isn’t much raves around here I’m thinking of throwing some in the middle of the forests.

I’m not looking to spend a pile of money just something for a decent night. Any tips would be great

Sorry I didn’t make this clear I’m planning on holding it in an abandoned brick building that’s pretty small could probably fit 100 people max so think the VM-50s would do

I always get so excited and nervous before a set that I can't eat or drink hardly. As soon as it's over I'm always super hungry and ready to smoke some weed. Just finished up a set with a ton of new equipment and it went flawlessly. Always love this feeling after of relief. 
"I recently had a few cheaper controllers and I didn't like the action on the cross faders or the way it sounds while scratching. I've been out of the game for over 20 years and the controllers I've tried are NOTHING compared to using a real turntable and vinyl.. Also, is serato or Traktor Pro with timecode vinyl much better than a good DJ controller?"
"I have some interest in starting out to DJ, my worry is that I have hearing loss, it’s sensorineural and moderately severe. I also have tinnitus. I have hearing aids that help a lot. I love music and spend a lot of time listening, and wouldn’t mind making it a living. I would love to do more with my passion rather than just let my hearing ability go to waste. Are there any DJs who have went into this field with hearing issues, or any that started without issues then got them and still work with it. How did you navigate everything? "
"Hey there. Today I woke up to a booking request, asking me to Play a 1-2 hour Set in a Dream Setting on a caribbean Island. At First I was hyped af, but after a Minute I smelled a scam of course. I'm far from being famous, all I can offer is 15k subscribers on YouTube, but that's it. My music would fit the vibe there, that's for Sure. I'm still sceptical because why would anyone pay more than 1k to book a Nobody Like me?

What could the scam be here other than to fish for Data? How do I figure Out wheter this Is a scam or not?

Update: Today I told the booker my concerns about this being some Kind of scam with a hacked Instagram Account. 
She then sent me a Proof Video, with my DJ Name in it, at the Location, giving me some more Details.it was definetly the Woman that is running the Instagram Account for many years. 

Long Story Short: i'm playing on a caribbean Island, during sunset next month. What the actual fuck?"

"I started djing on a Traktor S4 MKI, many many years ago. I then upgraded to an S8 I used for many years. I am confortable with controllers. 

After my S8, I bought a full Denon kit, 2 SC6000, 2 LC6000 and a X1850 mixer. This thing is awesome. 

In the past year I was temted to try stems. I resisted the urge up until now. I just bought a FLX10 to play with them. With it, it will also be more fun to prep sets for the club in Rekordbox as I mix in clubs in Montreal and mostly use the venue’s setup which is always CDJs 2 or 3k.

Right now I just fear I won’t use the Denon setup anymore and I am wondering if I should keep it or not.

Any ideas on what are the pros and cons of keeping/selling it?

Thanks!"

I currently have a xone 96 and 3 cdjs. Just got the 3rd and it’s great to have the deck but pricey..

"Hello, I am looking for an effect gear, like the rmx-1000 but with a looper capable of doing 4 or more beats, since rmx-1000 can only loop 2 beat.   
I am trying to emulate the function on the xone db4, that can loop 4 beats so is possible to operate effects on the loop while the song still going on playing in another channel.   
My xone db4 unfotunately appear to output kind of a metalic sound, I dont know why, so I think i am going to change it.  
My current setup is  Denon SC6000 -&gt; xone db4 (loop+effect on single channels) -&gt; rmx-1000  (effects on master)  
My idea for the new setup, if i find the right effect station is do this:  
DenonSC6000  ch1 -&gt; effect station 1-&gt; mixer   
Denon SC6000 ch2 -&gt; effect station 2 -&gt; mixer

"I've had Phase since it came out pretty much. I just replaced the 2nd remote recently, and I'm noticing the newer remotes haven't formed hairline cracks like the originals did and the battery life is very good on them. 

My original remotes had battery issues from jump street pretty much. For those of you that have gotten the new single/one-off replacement remotes that Phase offers, does the build quality seem better to you?  My originals formed hairline cracks pretty quick and the spindle ring was coming off sometimes on both pucks.

The new remotes seem a lot better. Maybe it's my imagination, but it wouldn't surprise me if Phase improved them without advertising it to avoid jaded users demanding free replacements. What say you? TIA for replies. Peace!"

" I cant decide between of this two controllers , NS4FX is brand new for 428 € and DDJ SX and SX 2 used is for between 400-500 € ( SX1 is cheaper ofc ) and they are really old im beware of hardware failure SX1 was released in 2012 and SX2 was released in 2014 .

How many benefits is on SX series compare to Numark NS4FX ?

I doesnt care about rekord box just want make some decent mixes at home without random lags and stutering on Windows i think Serato is better option here .

When you have something better i just want 2 things XLR output , portable system and 4 channels are not important .

I gonna be really thankful for every answer here ."
"Hey guys,

I’ve recently grabbed a load of tracks from zipdj. Some of them are clearly, without any doubt really low quality in terms of sound output, like terrible in comparison to other tracks. (I’ll dig through and compare them properly at some point) 

I was messing about at home the other day, just mixing anything and everything as I do and not putting any thought or effort into things, just literally getting to know my music.

So I’m not paying too much attention and I mix in a track to find its stupidly quiet and muffled, it honestly sounds like a terrible rip.

Is it safe to assume zipdj and maybe other pools don’t give a shit and just want volumes of audio?

On a side note, any record pools offering lossless quality?

Thanks 


Edit*

Sorry guys, I’m now guilty of not providing enough info.

I found a track that’s a good example of my issue, it’s not the same one, but boy does it sound shit!

Just to be clear, this was downloaded directly from ZipDJ, yet a it’s a remix of an older song but I fail to see how that’s relevant in terms of audio quality?

If anyone has zipdj, please feel free to search the following track
Amigos (EP) Let’s Kick It (Original Mix) - Fer BR, Paco Osuna, Inglesias, Manu Gonzalez- [54765607]

Spek won’t install on either my Mac or MacBook.

Fakin the funk lists this particular file as 128kbps - the frequency spectrum showing a fairly consistent audio file but at 16,540.

 Not that it matters, but to offer some insight, I’m a techno dj, but grabbing a load of house tech and other stuff for a yacht party which is why I’m grabbing loads of tech house and other genres I wouldn’t normally, I also purchase everything I play at festivals in AIFF format normally but on occasion I’ll use a 320kbps mp3, this audio file I absolutely wouldn’t / couldn’t though.

Your thoughts please?

"Hello everyone. A DJ on the East Coast. Started a year and a half ago and went through the ranks. I main gig was a college bar in which turned to a club on certain nights and this gig is through a company. The college bar is located smack dead in the city so we have both college kids and local adults. The gig is 8pm-1am , college kids usually get there early and leave around 11 then the locals start coming in. Me personally, I play for everyone, I play all types of music from house, house-pop, edm, country, singalongs, and then rap. Unfortunately, starting in January a lot of people have started fighting towards the end of the night. Now I’m one of the top djs on the Main Street , very popular with students and locals. Unfortunately, I had consecutive fights towards the end of the night. I’ve played “love” by keyshia cole and girls started fighting… long story short 2 weeks ago there was a huge fight and the bar was fined. The management and even my boss (owner of the company) blamed me calling me a “hood dj”… they explained my style (talking on the mic to get the crowd going) and the fact I play rap I’m a hood dj who attracts “the wrong crowd” Even worst they agreed that I need to take the blame and “fall on the sword” … it hurt and I was pretty upset. I played rnb and singalongs  for an hour , yet still a fight…. when I looked back at my playlist for those weeks I played more pop than rap.. the other dj played more rap.. how would you guys go about this ? I feel I’m being attacked because I’m the only black dj who’s playing urban music and getting people who like that music… felt not even my boss had my back … sorry for the long rant "

"Hey there - I am using an Allen and Heath Xone K2 with Traktor to do some very basic tech house mixing, just for fun / personal enjoyment. This setup is super compact and I can sit it next to my MacBook easily / travel with it. 

The one feature I don't get with the K2 that I miss is the jog wheel, which allows me to easily move through tracks. 

I am trying to find a MIDI controller which has a single jog wheel (to keep size down). Extra points if it has 4 buttons so I could hold a button to select 1 of the 4 channels. 

Almost like this (picture below) but closer to the size of jog wheel on a Pioneer DDJ:

"Hello everyone, 

I’d like to ask another question about set up etc. 

I want to create a “mothership” like performance set up with a Traktor kontrol s4 mk3 (S4) in the middle as the center piece. I’m also interested in a machine mk 3 (MM3) for a production stand point. 

I know that the MM3 isn’t a stand alone unit. 

My question is, would a setup that consists of an S4 with two MM3s running into tracks A and D, being used as stem / remix decks or hot cue launchers be possible? Or would I just be better off with getting two Traktor F1?

I originally planned to just get the F1’s, but I do want a MM3 for production  and I like the aesthetics of two MM3s being plugged into an S4 for performances."
"I started DJing a long time ago and the standard then for a set seemed to be an hour to 80 minutes. I suspect because of this - If you can produce an hour plus that demonstrates you can mix and not mess things up, you're proving you are competent. So getting into things you see 80 minute mixes and assume ""I guess I need to be making 80 minute mixes""  


Aint nobody got time for that. Shorter = More engagement. Plus on competency, you can fake that through editing so like who gives a crap about any 80 minute set really, the other DJs who would know something is impressive also know it could have been accomplished through editing. The general public should be your target audience, not other DJs who only have time to listen to the insane amounts of music they're organizing themselves and probably not other people's mixes. 

Give the general public 30 minute mixes and 90 second video clips, they'll engage with that. I would argue that in a 30 minute mix I display my competency more than any 80 minute set I recorded in the past because I am making that 30 minutes as much of a bonfire as I can, whereas the 80 minutes I would have been maybe hesitant to be as aggressive"
"So i tried the HD25, but am not a fan of the cable, and the HD25 Plus is too procey imo. The HD25 light would be a better option imo looking at the cable lol, because i don't need the swifel and the bigger headband. Then i came across the Aiaiai TMA-2 DJ. But this one i didn't try yet. There is a local guy selling his 8 months old pair with S05 drivers for 150€.

Would you take this deal? Do you maybe know some cheaper options? tried the pioneer cx, but the fit is uncomfortable."

"I can't stop thinking about [this article I read on RA](https://ra.co/news/80412), and just want to hear other peoples' takes. It's about how a number of clubs and festivals (including Basement and Wire Festival) are launching an initiative called Support The Sound which aims to ""lessen the wage gap between DJs and producers through tracklist reporting"" with Aslice. DJs playing at clubs/events that are part of this initiative will be asked to share a percentage of their revenue with producers/artists whose tracks they played during their set, which Aslice suggests as 5% or more of the DJ's gig fee.

5% is not a ton, especially from a $100-$400+ gig, and I'm not exactly sure how they're dividing it up from there. Though it seems that there is already a system in place to get these producers royalties from performances of their tracks, and that would be through the PROs (ASCAP, BMI, PRS, etc.).

Every club pays an amount per year to the PROs for a blanket license. My understanding is that writers (the artist/""producer"" in this case) get paid out from this pot of money. I got this from the Donald Passman book ""All You Need To Know About The Music Business"":

&gt;The \[PROs\] pay based on domestic concert performances, but it's only for the top three hundred grossing tours as reported in a magazine called *Pollstar*. The PROs distribute money based on **set lists**...which they get from either the venues or the artist's management...If you're performing in coffee houses and small venues, these aren't tracked separately, but both BMI and ASCAP have programs for you to submit your materials and get paid something.

Now it's my understanding that writers who do not meet the ""top three hundred"" criteria get paid from this blanket license pool of money, though I could very well be wrong. It would make sense that if there is already a way to submit your setlists to the PROs so they can pay out these producers, then shouldn't the focus shift to there? This would require more emerging producers to make sure they're affiliated with a PRO, but why wouldn't someone want to do that. Aslice currently charges $10 per playlist (setlist) submission, but they do pay out 85% to producers. I should note that Aslice states on their website that they're not there to replace the PROs, but to act as an additional revenue source.

It feels like through this model, producers who have already registered their songs with a PRO could be getting paid twice for the same performance, though once at the expense of the DJ. Let me just say I believe artists/writers/producers should be getting paid for performances of their works. We should be buying tracks, paying for tickets to shows, etc. This initiative almost comes across as venues passing the buck off to performers, while co-opting social justice/economic justice language to juice their audiences, especially given this quote from the RA article ""the role of music producers has been marginalised and undervalued.""

I wouldn't be surprised if a major factor in some clubs embracing this model would be because they've made a deal with Aslice, the same way a venue will partner with one primary ticketing platform for a sum of money (I've seen instances where that number is in the tens-of-thousands).

Another major question would be whether the playlist submission fee is covered by the venue (which it either won't be, or it will be deducted from the DJ's pay), and if DJ's will be getting paid more as well.

Again, it's only 5% of the DJ's earnings. Playlist submission is only $10. All-in-all, producers should be compensated, I'm not saying they shouldn't, and more music makers should educate themselves on the business. DJs should be paid fairly, and the entire responsibility of this issue is not the DJ's alone. It's entirely possible that this creates a situation that frames this as a problem handed to the DJ's to remedy, rather than part of a larger issue.

Thoughts?"
"Hi everyone,

I went to use my RX3 in performance mode today and noticed the effects trigger switched from channels A/B on the knob to 1/2.

Also noticed my gains not going as high as they usually would. Normally I would have them set around 10:00 and the gain would reach the first yellow light. Now I have to crank them to 12:00 for to reach the same level.

Another issue I noticed is my sampler sounds aren't working any more. I had them mapped and they were working fine. I see them triggering in RB but there's no sound coming out. I checked the gain in RB and it's at 12:00. 

AND the recording button is greyed out and not letting me record.

I went ahead and updated to the latest version of Rekordbox 6.8.3 (from 6.8.1) and I'm having the same issue. I was just using the same setup last week with no issues and this happened today.

Anyone ever experience anything like this? Please let me know if you know of a solution.


Thanks y'all.


EDIT: I also noticed that both waveforms aren't showing up on the RX3 screen when 2 tracks are loaded. It'll load one, then when I load another it won't show up. After loading another track, the previous one that didn't show appears and the new track's waveform won't appear.

SOLUTION: I guess I messed with the settings and set RB to external mixer mode this week. I switched it to internal and it fixed itself. 


EDIT 2: Don't update to 6.8.3 if you use an XDJ-RX3 in performance mode. The issue with the waveforms not displaying together still exists. I downgraded back to 6.8.1 and it works again."

"I recently purchased two CDJ-3000s and a DJM-A9 brand new for an in-home studio setup. I live in a high rise apartment. I have the decks set up on a standing desk beneath a window (normally the shades are closed). The left CDJ and the speaker are plugged directly into outlet 1 and the DJM and the right CDJ are plugged into outlet 2. On outlet 2, I have one of those adapters that turns it into a 2-socket to a 6-socket setup. Plugged into that, I have a power strip. So in total, pulling from outlet 2, I have one DJM, one CDJ, the standing desk, the ethernet splitter, and a lamp. I am guessing that there's something about this general setup that's causing this behavior where the equipment randomly turns off in the middle of use but even the CDJ plugged directly into outlet 1 turned off. It's happened twice in the month of use and only after 1-2 hours of play. Any advice for what I can get to improve this setup? Unsure if I need something that regulates voltage, protects against surges, etc. Thanks!"

I have the chance to buy one of these bad boys in the US and save about $1500 doing so compared to back here. We use 230-240v down here and just sussing out if these mixers can be converted instead of using an external converter. 

Surely they are all made the same in the factory a d it's only a setting/power cable that is changed for each market.

"I've been bedroom DJ'ing with a party here and there for the past year+ and am seeing the horizon where my MacBook Air isn't going to cut the storage space requirements. Not in a rush to make the change, but want to be strategic in how I move with the following accomplishments if possible:

* Maintain Loops
* Maintain Playlists in Apple Music - How I store/develop my sets
* Move music from one giant unorganized folder into a structure that breaks down into genres and/or release years.
   * Not opposed to manual work here, but are there options to automate selections to get me a head start?
*  (Stretch Goal) Doesn't require a reanalysis of my entire music library - arguably this should not be a problem, but I learned the hard way with DJPro at the advent of V.5.

"Hey all. I'm an artist that makes dance music and recently started DJing as a way to get in front of people. I'd say I have a decently strong artist brand at this point; lots of press, a good sized following on IG and Spotify. I'm working on getting more of the kind of gigs I really want (clubs, festivals, special events etc), where I can play my original music and play in my style.

While I'm getting some of these kinds of gigs, in the process of pitching myself, I'm getting solicited by venues that are looking for more open format/top 40 music. These gigs pay well but I don't think they really fit my ""brand."" It's like they're only half reading my pitch materials- they see my follower count and see the word ""DJ"" and want to book me, but essentially just want popular music/their requests.

FWIW I have absolutely no problem with these gigs. I think they're fun, I certainly don't mind getting paid, and at the end of the day I still see it as good experience. Some of these bars have good name recognition and sound impressive, even if they aren't really interested in ""my"" music. However, I worry that taking too many of these gigs will muddy my brand. 

I sort of feel like I'm in the place where I can't say no to gigs because I need to build my experience and credibility. But I also don't know if playing these kinds of gigs helps me land the gigs I actually want. I guess I can always play under an alias, but I suspect that the reason I am getting booked at all is for the ""clout"" around my artist project. 

Anyway, I'm interested to hear how you guys are balancing this sort of thing as I'm sure it's not uncommon. Also, I'd love more advice on how to get more of the ""on brand"" types of gigs. Thanks! "

Looking for some advice. Before I turned 18, I was very passionate about music. I was in a band. Started getting into music production. Pretty much was a fuckin geek of all the technicality. Started to DJ after college. A few years later everything pretty much went downhill. Started to lose interest. I was a perfectionist in everything. I never really enjoyed the process. Felt lazy doing stuff. Life and other personal stuff affected my motivation. I’ve continued to DJ and make music but I am never consistent and persistent in my supposed “hobbies”. People say I’m good but I just don’t feel like putting the work. I hesitate to enjoy it. This is something I really don’t want to lose interest in my life. Sometime I feel I didn't put in the effort as much since I missed out on opportunities. All my life has been music, and I want to accomplish something for myself even if I don’t share it.  I rarely DJ or do music anymore. 

Am I frustrated or just over this musician phase? "

"Hey guys!  
So I'd like to start adding some extra spice to my techno sets by adding a live 303! I've got the behringer TD-3 and I kinda hoped there would be a way to connect this to a setup with a DJM and some CDJ's (or maybe even through a laptop with Traktor/rekordbox?). However I am having a very hard time connecting this stuff to my super old DJM 750 and CDJ 850's lol.

These are probably too old so now I'd like to hear about some possibilites, how do you go about setting up a hybrid liveset? What are my options? Kan I use CDJ's still or do I need a laptop like most DJ's who play hybrid live use?

I am very uneducated about this so any help is welcome! Cheers &lt;3"

"Hey everyone,

"Put simply, I own a Xone:92R which I purchased 3 years ago for €850 - It's in excellent condition still.

There is currently a second hand Taula 4 mixer in great condition for €1,200.

I noticed prices of Xone:92 mixers have gone up considerably in the last few years, with these now being priced around €1,550 brand new. Furthermore, the model I own (With knobs instead of volume faders) seems to be out of production.

I'm perfectly happy with my current mixer but always been interested in owning a rotary mixer like the Taula 4. 

I'm torn between holding onto my Xone:92R, or selling it for a profit compared to what I bought it, and buying the Taula 4 instead.

Additionally, do you think a selling price of €1,200 for my Xone:92 is reasonable, given the build quality of these mixers, as well as the fact that my model is out of production?

"Hello, I've got an S4 MK3 by Native using it with the latest version of traktor pro 3.11 + a screen hack for a windows Dekstop. But slowly I'll start playing sets at gigs rather than live so I wanted to know if this upgrade is sound or even if i should upgrade.

The upgrade mentioned is about my laptop since my desktop boasts a Ryzen 7 5800x which is good beef.

The laptop has a Ryzen 3 3200u(2C/4T) with 12 gigs of ram and a 256ssd(small i know but upgradable)  
The upgrade im thinking about is a laptop with a Ryzen 5(4C/8T) 7520u but only 8 gigs of RAM

I plan to use this laptop only for DJing and would like to know if it would be alright for some 3-4 years or if i should either stick to the Ryzen 3 or look into intel for a change.

Sadly my max budget is around 400$ for a laptop and i will either go for a used gaming laptop this new chip, or stick with the oldie.

I'm a bit in a predicament, I currently have a DJM-750Mk2, Back when CDJs where a part of my setup i didn't mind it, i gotten rid of them and i now only have 3 1200s, and the pre amps on that mixer are not doing it for me. I absolutely love the pioneer effects so I'm leaning towards the V10. I've played with a friends Allen and heath and the sound was so nice and warm and i fell in love with its sound but i found it just lacking the effects.  Everyone who has a V10 says its the best sounding pioneer mixer at the moment so i find myself between a rock and a hard place. I play about 50 percent Traktor DVS and 50 percent vinyl.

Looking for the opinion of fellow dj's who mostly play vinyl. Id love to hear Anyone who has used both mixers!"
"In my 10 years as a touring DJ, I've noticed the importance of good mental health is always overlooked, especially by aspiring DJs trying to make their dreams a reality.

Professional DJing is not a career for the mentally weak. Every touring artist, across all genres of music and art forms, will at some point struggle with their mental health. It's the nature of the job. The combination of easy access to substances, long and late hours, irregular sleep schedules, pressure to sell tickets, social media presence/comparisons, and the need to constantly produce great art for fans, all while paying the bills, will create a ticking time bomb that will explode if not managed meticulously. I battle with this balancing act regularly, so I wanted to provide my top tips for all of you out there:

1. Self-care Is Non-Negotiable: You will burn out if you can't care for yourself. Whether meditation, exercise, healthy eating, or simply taking time for yourself, ensure you're nurturing your physical and emotional well-being amidst the hectic touring schedule.

2. Establish Boundaries: The word ""No"" is your friend and essential in carving out moments for rest. This could mean turning down a gig or the third afterparty of the weekend.

3. Stay Connected: Touring is isolating, so stay connected with loved ones and fellow DJs. Maintain relationships the best you can. Surrounding yourself with a supportive network can provide much-needed comfort and encouragement.

4. Practice Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness practices into your daily routine. Whether meditation, breathing exercises, or appreciating your surroundings, mindfulness can help reduce stress amidst the chaos of touring.

5. Seek Professional Support: Don't hesitate to seek professional support if you struggle. Touring can take a toll on mental well-being, and having a therapist or counselor to talk to goes a long way. Many therapists offer virtual sessions, making it easier to access support while on the road.

6. Stay Balanced: Take breaks from the nightlife scene when possible, engage in activities that bring you joy outside of DJing, and remember to prioritize your overall well-being above all else. Sometimes partying all night is exactly what you need to blow off steam. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY!

Don't get me wrong, I love being able to DJ for a living. It was my dream, and it still is. I just thought I'd shine a light on the other side of the industry that isn't talked about as much.  "

"I used to enjoy it a lot. When i was younger (18-24) I had dreams of becoming the next Ben UFO lol. I had a big group of friends with whom i went raving a lot, we did a lot of drugs and it was fun while it lasted. 

This environment, my passion for electronic music and my dead end job were the 3 core reasons i started DJ’ing. I had a lot of friends that shared my passion. My friends always enjoyed my selections and becoming a DJ felt like a career path that was meant for me. 

Then the pandemic happened. Not going in to too much detail here , but eventually those raver friend circles died out. I became depressed and i started working on myself.

I stopped working dead end jobs and decided to go to college and get a degree in CS. Fast forward to today and i have my degree and i have a job where i feel good and earning good money. I am very thankful for that.

Part of me misses playing tracks, but i also don’t have that hunger anymore. Anytime i get the opportunity to play i reject the opportunity or go in on it but don’t really want it anymore. I feel like there are a lot more passionate DJ’s out there and it is just too difficult to break through without putting in the work (obviously). It feels like i need to make a choice. Keep working my stable job, or quit and go hard DJ’ing. But i’m just doing really good at my job, and it kinda sucks because that is also the reason why i’m losing my hunger to become successful as a DJ. It feels like i let down the younger me who wanted that so bad. Maybe i just miss the idea of becoming a successful DJ

Kinda needed to rant. This has been on my mind for the last 2 years.

Any advice is appreciated "
"After long consideration and research I decided for an Eventide H90 to replace both my Boss DD-7 and Boss RV-6 effect pedals to augment my Xone 96 mostly used for DJing electronic music. It was recommended from time to time, alongside alternatives like the Boss GT-1000 and the Line 6 Helix, but I did not find explicit information to which capacity it could work with the mixer. I had hopes that I could use it in dual stereo mode as both a send-return device (like the previous pedals) and a master insert (like the RMX-1000) and not only is that indeed possible, it goes even further than that.

How I set it up:

* connect H90 1/2 in to Xone 96 SND A, H90 1/2 out to Xone 96 RTN A - ensure output is set to Line level, not Hi-Z one Xone 96 and to Line level on H90 as well
* connect H90 3/4 in to Xone 96 MASTER INSERT SND, H90 3/4 out to Xone 96 MASTER INSERT RTN
* [enable dual routing in H90](https://cdn.eventideaudio.com/manuals/h90/1.7.1/content/edit-modes/routing.html#dual-routing) and choose an appropriate routing path for the effects setup
   * Pre/Post allows for using effect A for the SND/RTN chain, effect B in the master insert
   * Presets A &amp; B in Series/Parallel on Path 1 allows for using both effects (independently) on SND/RTN
   * Presets A &amp; B in Series/Parallel on Path 2 allows for using both effects (independently) on master insert

This works absolutely flawlessly and the resulting sound is incredible, leagues above what I was used to with the previous pedals and absolutely no degradation in the beautifully warm Xone 96 sound quality.

What I was not aware about before is that routing can be adjusted on-the-fly. Thus, two effects can be used on SND/RTN for one track, one for SND/RTN and one for the master insert during a transition and both on master insert when crafting complex compositions of multiple tracks.

Only downside I currently see for DJ use is that there only is one global tempo setting (like on the RMX-1000) and it only supports full bpm steps, no fractional steps. As far as I'm aware, the built-in MIDI clock of the H90 cannot be fed with the Xone 96's MIDI outputs, but setting it manually is surprisingly easy using the rotary knobs compared to the tap-based bpm control I was used to on the pedals, though that is available as an option as well.

It could also be used to feed both A and B SND/RTN chains, but that would lead to the loss of the master insert functionality. As effects can be customized on-the-fly on the H90 anyway, I did not see any benefit in this. The H90 Control app is surprisingly easy to use, but the pedal has so insanely many customization options that there's probably no ever being 'done' setting it up."

"Howaya lads

I've just updated to Serato 3 to pay around with stems as they seem really useful for my sets. 

So far I am loving the feature however I've noticed that sometimes the overall sound is very patchy once I start isolating vocals from one deck and drums from another. It's mostly fine if I only remove one type of sound but the more I do the worse it the quality sounds.

I checked the Roland site and the latest firmware update was 2018. 

Has anyone else noticed this too?"

Has anyone heard of this term for DJ’n?
It’s got something to do with BPM sign language? Like the Nashville number system for DJ’s? I saw a couple of dudes DJn together at a rave in Vegas in 2019 and they were using some kind of sign language for changes. I’m a DJ and I’ve been DJn for about 5 years but I’ve never seen anything like it before. And I asked a couple of people who didn’t know either but this one older cat said he thought it was called “Plattah!” I asked him “Platter?” And he said no, that it had an “H” at the end. I spent a couple of years checking the internet and asking around, especially DJ’s, but nothing came up. I began to think that it was just some bs that dude was telling me. But then I went to Mardi Gras in 2022 and one night I ended up watching these 2 DJ’s who were playing together and they seemed to be using the same technique. I think it was a guy and girl but they were dressed up in costumes (if you’ve ever been to Mardi Gras, you know what I’m talking about!) I got a chance to talk to them after their set and they affirmed that they were using “Plattah” and I was right about it being like the Nashville Number System for DJ’s! They showed me how it worked but I was so fucked up, I can’t even remember their DJ names… But I remember it was mostly fingers on one hand kinda like a baseball catcher calling a play or something and all I really remember is that it somehow covered BPM’s, the Key of the track, changes or transitions, AND genres somehow because these cats were playing all kinds of shit! 
Well, now me and a friend are DJn together and he’s been a hip hop DJ for years now and I’ve been primarily EDM since I started but recently we’ve both been branching out and even delving into old funk and disco. We like mashups and we like each other’s style and stuff and hanging out going to shows and recently decided to join forces and DJ together but we both freestyle our sets so naturally we want to freestyle DJn together! We tried Abelton Link but we both agreed it just didn’t sound right or vibe well and while practicing we can just kinda tell each other BPM’s or changes but in a louder environment, that shit don’t fly! 
So my question is, does anyone know about the PLATTAH method and can tell me how to do it or point me in the direction of where to get some kind of instructions for it? Like I said it’s definitely a thing but obviously it’s not widespread knowledge."

"So basically this promoter asked me to have a more ""Uk sound"" for a special event someone is throwing this friday at a (EDM) club.

So far I was thinking : Garage, dnb, breakbeats, euro 4/4 (130-145bpm). Maybe a some techno in there and a LOT of drill acapellas and or recognizable vocals ala flowdan.

Any ideas to interpret ""Uk vibes""?


:UPDATE: Alright, well, thanks for an absolutely MASSIVE amount of very good recommendations!

 but unfortunately, it seems like the host saw Fred again and Chase &amp; status's Boiler room, and that's his UK vibe. So, nothing too ""deep"", and promoters want to keep it appealing to a larger crowd

So what i'll be going for is ""sub genre mainstream"" as i 
like to call it. So Basically, play very popular tracks they probably heard from sub genres they mostly barely know. To make them feel like they're experiencing ""underground"" music even tho it's garage or dnb anthems. Also throw in some night bass since they'll most likely know this as well.

 I'll be digging in your recommendations, so far found some good stuff. And some really neat stuff for my fun lil' personal collection.

"Hi,

I have trouble talking to people. Back in school I was doing the same things as everybody else. Communicating was easy because people could identify with any problems you might have

But now since I became a full time DJ it is harder to talk and communicate to people. They don't know what I mean or go through.


- When you are off, everybody else is working
- When you are working, everybody else is sleeping
- People have a hard time understanding how difficult it is to be a freelancer and not always having certainty of income like you have with a 9 to 5 job.
- Everybody thinks you do nothing but partying which is of course not true. I was almost denied renting a room because of this.
- Stress when you do a DJ gig. Sometimes it feels like it's you vs everybody else in the club

"How do you guys sort your libraries. I have 3 big tabs with techno, house, disco, and hits, but there are too many subgenres. Some playlists have 10 songs and others have 200 which makes it very difficult to have a good overview. One big problem is that whenever I want to add a new playlist, I then have to go through all my songs to see if they fit the playlist which takes too much time with 3100 songs. I also have playlists for specific sets I play which is usually what I resort back to when I am looking for songs to play at another set but this results in me playing a lot of the same songs and missing out on bangers that I have forgotten about.

Did anyone else have and solve this problem for themselves? There is probably not one universal best library layout as everyone plays differently but some tips would be very useful! I do not want to spend 20 hours sorting everything again, only to realise halfway that I regret the chosen layout.

"Hi, I use Djay Pro since its recent integration w Apple Music /iTunes. I’m wondering if anyone knows if you can create a cue point in your track that’s linked to another so that when the first one is reached the track automatically jumps to the other (second one)? 

Essentially seamlessly skipping a portion of the song without any auditory detection from possible human error of pressing the target (second) cue point a tad too early or late.
 
It seems like something that would be within Djay pro’s software capabilities, so I’m feeling like there might be a way I’m missing. If anyone has any idea and can help me out that would be soooo so appreciated 😊 thank you!"
"Hey all, I've read on the Pioneer forum that there are 3 font size settings on the CDJ3000 but a) I can't find the setting to adjust it in the manual and b) does that include the font size for the hot cues or just the browser? I don't own the 3000 but I'm playing on them tomorrow in a club and I'd like to know where that setting is. I assume it's somewhere in the Utility settings, but the manual doesn't mention it."
"Random question but does anyone know if DJs who play at a venue get sent the professional photos taken when they’re playing after they’ve played or they would have to find it themselves?

I found photos of this dj I met that night at the venue and they’re good photos but I don’t want to send it to him if he’s already seen them. "
"Look, I get it, it's fun to say stuff in the middle of your set.  Shoutouts, hype, whatever, it's all the same, it all sucks and amateurish.  If you are recording a set, do not interrupt yourself by feeling compelled to say anything, or make any noises.  Let the music speak for itself.  Literally nothing you contribute will add any value to what the music has to say.  If it did, you'd be an MC, not a DJ.  

I just gave up trying to listen to two very famous DJs because they cant seem help themselves from interrupting the flow of their amazing sets with their own interjections.  Nothing, literally nothing, is worth interrupting the flow of the set you've worked on.  If you have something to say, get it out before or after the music is finished.  You're career will thank you later."
"Hey, folks,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question but here it goes.

I own an S4 MK3 and I have a gig on Friday. I was wondering if I should bring the S4 with me because I feel more comfortable playing with it than with the CDJs. I expressed my thoughts to the organiser of the event and his words were:

""*Screw the controller, man. Do you how much worse it sounds?*""

And I started thinking about it. Is it really that bad compared to a CDJ3000?  


Has anyone had the chance to compare the audio from these two devices?

P.S. The mixer in the club is DJM900NX2"
"I just love the vibe from the early days of hip-hop, and I am trying to get a feel for it for my sets.

Here are a few gems on Mixcloud so far:

"It's finally time for me to move on to more advanced controllers!! yay!

But my problem is, where I'm from, controllers are very very overpriced (almost twice the SRP) and even then they're not readily available.

I will be traveling soon and I was looking to buy a controller then. My main question is, is it safe for the controller to be stored inside a suitcase to be checked in by plane? Surely the ones I'm looking at will be too big for carry on allowance but I'm pretty sure they will fit inside those bigger suitcases. I'm not too keen on buying another seat for it because of the cost but if that's the only viable option then I guess there's no other choice.

But ultimately I was wondering, is it okay to store it inside a suitcase for checking in provided there will be clothes as cushions etc. outside of the controller's box?

Thank you for any and all suggestions or answers!"

Not advertising. 

I’m a software engineering student and as a class project my roommate and I built a (shitty) app to let DJs advertise clips of their sets.

It’s supposed to match people throwing house parties with local DJ listings so they can book and pay ahead of time through the app.

My DJ friends were super stoked and want us to develop it into a full working network.

I’m assuming there’s a reason “Uber for DJs” doesn’t exist already. Can anyone tell me what could go wrong with an app like this?

Alternatively, is this something that DJs would actually be interested in?"

"Hi everyone i just bought a tascam dr 40 to record mix. My mixer is xone DB2 

After watching some youtube tutorials i set up the tascam based on the videos' instruction. Im pretty firm that i follow all the instruction and set up the record mode and everything correctly on the tascam. 

However the tascam is recording external audio and background noise, it doesn't record the internal soundcard output. 

I tried to connect the tascam to record out and then the booth out output on the mixer, every time it still record background noise and external audio again.  

I use the cable TRS to same dual 1/4 to connect the tascam to booth out output
I used the TRS jack to Dual RCA to connect the tascam to record out output  

I think i used the WRONG cables so the tascam keeps recording background noise and external audio? 

I do some research, and i think should i plug tbe RCA male to XLR male cable or 1/4 TS to Dual RCA cable into record out output on the mixer (pics of those 2 cable included)  then this will work correctly for the Tascam to record internal soundcard output and no more background noise, external audio? 

Any tips will be really appreciated since i been struggle a lot with this issue recently. Thank you"

"Exciting news for Audiophiles is that Tidal HiFi will now drop to the same price as Tidal's base subscription for an individual plan of $11/month as of April 10, 2024. Not so great for those who use Tidal with software such as Serato, VirtualDJ, or Algoriddum djay Pro is that Tidal will add $9 monthly to the base subscription.  As per the digital trends article, ""*For those who want to be able to access the Tidal library via* [*software- and hardware-based DJ tools*](https://tidal.com/djs)*, an add-on fee of $9 per month will be needed.*""

Over the past couple of months, Serato and djay Pro removed the ability to use Stems; separate tracks for voice, drums, and rhythm with Tidal's streaming music because they say it falls within a different licensing/copyright tier. Could this additional $9 per month bring back the ability to use Stems with Tidal? Or is this just a new DJ tax for the privilege to connect Tidal streaming?  


Apple Music recently became available on djay Pro without increasing its subscription cost. My take is that Tidal is going to use the additional $9 from DJs to bring back Stems which would be pretty awesome. What do you think?

Wanted to dive into a crucial topic sometimes talked about, but not often prioritized: wellness. Amidst our passion for DJing, how do you prioritize self-care and wellness in your busy schedules?

"Last night was a near trainwreck of a gig, just barely pulled it back from the gutter the last two hours. Was booked for a surprise birthday, where the hubby wanted danceable 90’s music and I prepared a few different genre crates since 90’s is one hell of a broad of a term. 3 hours in and not a single one of the genres drew more than 2-3 people to the floor, and the requests for 80’s, top 10, grunge, eurodisco, underground hip-hop, trance etc. were piling up. When the planner came over with his phone and a top 1000 Songs from 1970-2020 ready on his Spotify I nearly just packed up and left, I felt like a total failure at this point. But I straightened my neck and started freestyling all the sing-along, top songs from every era and genre I could think of and miraculously made the night end on a highnote with nearly all on the floor dancing and singing their brains out. But, the first few hours still haunt me, I felt so utterly useless and ill prepared. Time to dig into the crates and make a ton of 3-5 songs mini-crates of every genre known to man and be sure to get a bit more info from the planner upfront. I won’t let that happen again (but I’m a grown man, I know it will 😅)."

"Last night I decided to have another look at getting audio from my S7 into OBS (Previously I found a hack on my S9 which involved connecting the 2nd USB cable to my mac, and for some reason that worked, but this didn't work on the S7)  


I wanted to avoid having to use an external soundcard, and the official instructions on the Pioneer website which involved using Soundflower, Jack and creating aggregate devices etc seemed unnecessarily complicated - after all Ableton is able to see multiple inputs from the S7, with channels 5/6 being the REC out, so why can't OBS?   


So, I hopped on the OBS discord channel, and asked that very question, and as fate would have it a helpful chap called PatTheMav replied:

"I started DJing last year August. Since then I have made significant improvements, booked myself a lot of different gigs, and now I am gaining more recognition in the DJ scene. Even so, I still consider myself a beginner since I don’t believe I’m at a point I can confidently say I can mix most song’s perfectly (or at a good enough standard compared to others)

Although I like to believe I am good at DJing and people have told me I am, I still can’t help but feel like I’m shit at it. The more I practice and try to improve my skills, the more I feel like I’m failing and I just get really upset. Like way more upset than I should get, it can ruin my week sometimes. I don’t want to give up and have no plans too, I just feel like I’m stuck at this level and I’m not improving fast enough. 

Does anyone else feel like this or am I being dramatic? I’m trying to tell myself to just have fun and enjoy the process and I will learn/improve on the way, I did only start a few months ago I don’t need to be perfect right now. But I can’t help but feel like I should be so much better at this by now. 

Idk, I sound like I’m fighting myself in this post lol. I just would really like advice. I want this negative feeling/thoughts to calm down. It does motivate me to want to improve but it feels really shitty, I start to doubt myself and abilities a lot which makes me reluctant to practice or want to book gigs. I’m taking a 2 month break from gigs to focus on improving and doing mini projects but any advice is welcomed. 

Also any tips on how to improve eqing. I’m still struggling with finding good balance of sounds with eqing, one of the things that is really frustrating me right now. 

 
Edit: Thank you so much for the advice. This gave me a lot of new ways of thinking, helped me understand myself better and plan out what my next steps are. When I wrote this I was just writing down my thoughts/ranting, hoping to get at-least 2-3 comments of advice, so it was a nice surprise to see people responding. This is something I’m really passionate about, hoping to turn this into one of my careers in the future so I really appreciate the help !!!

"Started with a Dragonfly black and Schitt Fulla 3- (I nearly have never used the Fulla)

So, looking for a replacement. I've for a long time now eyed the DragonFly Reds(i hear Cobalt isn't as warm, so i feel like i should pass over that)- but, i understand the dragonfly lineup is a tad overpriced even though i don't mind getting another and the Black never had issues for me at all.

"I'm DJing a wedding today and it has been a few yrs since my last gig. I've got a newer laptop with OS Ventura,Serato DJ Pro v3, and will be using a DJM S-11 for the first time, all equipment is rented.

I'm curious if its a good idea to download and install the driver for the mixer ahead of time (I'm guessing it is in fact a good idea) before I plug in, to just get that out of the way, I imagine Serato prompt me if it needs to upgrade some firmware on the mixer.

Been a while, so just trying to make sure I'm prepared for the wedding gig.

"I’ve come to a point in my DJing where I get quite a lot of requests to plays different nightclubs/events and some of them are really fun but there’s also quite a few that are just a different vibe/different crowd than the music I want to play and the kind of genre I want to have in my sets. 

I produce music myself and want to play my own songs but in a way that makes sense in my dj sets so I try to be extremely careful what events I choose to play at.

I know the general advice in the beginning is to just take every gig you get but since I’ve kind of gone past that point of hunting for dj gigs I’d love to hear what you guys think on this?

"Question to the people with the attention of the mods. One thing I’ve notice as I’ve been on this forum is that there are many types of dj here. This gives us a great range of perspective but it also causes some tension and conflicting advice. For example when asking about reading a crowd, one will advise to check your ego and play what makes the crowd happy, while the next will say fuck the crowd play what you feel. Or on the recent festival post some people advised to preplan your set while I find that blasphemous. A lot of these opinions depend on what kind of dj you are. If you’re a wedding/open format dj maybe it makes sense to go with the crowd, if your playing a mainstream festival, maybe a preplaned set is better, while for underground djs it makes more sense to showcase your abilities as a selector and play a set that’s spontaneous.

I think it would be helpful to know what type of dj is asking questions and what type of dj is giving advice. In the sports sub reddits, there’s a flare next to your username for team/player affiliation. I think it would be useful for us to identify our background so our perspectives are contextualized. Maybe some tags could be by genre/style “House”, “Open Format”, “Hip Hop”, or by event type “wedding”, “underground club”, “bedroom dj”, etc

Thoughts?"

"**TLDR:** What application do you use on your computer to catalog and manage your music library and playlists? How do you back it up?

FWIW I'm on a Mac but I am open to switching to Windows. I honestly prefer Windows but heard that Macs are better for DJing which is why I have been using them.

So, I used to use iTunes (which is now the Music app) to catalog/manage all my music and playlists. A lot of these playlists were smart playlists (to show songs by genre, or by decade, or to only show clean edits or remixes, etc.) but some were also ""top hits during the summer of 20xx"" type playlists.

Then I would just open up Serato or Djay or whatever and it would seamlessly integrate with my iTunes library and all my playlists would be there for me to perform with.

This worked great for a while; however, every few years if I upgrade my operating system (or the computer itself) the music library will often just obliterate itself and I'll get some stupid error.  I still have all the mp3's safely on my computer, but all my playlists get hosed. Because I use a Mac, I can't just easily (if at all?) downgrade the operating system or the version of the iTunes/Music app, at least not without erasing my entire computer which is a massive inconvenience.

Yes, I back up my library. But it seems that the way the iTunes/Music app imports/exports your past library database file changes every couple years and the support from Apple around this issue isn't very helpful so I'm stuck rebuilding all of my playlists again.

I'm sick of this happening...what do I do?

a) Buy a dedicated laptop just for DJing and never connect it to the internet/don't update it? But then, if that computer ever breaks down I may run into the same issue, right? Plus what if I need/want to buy an new controller, and then that controller requires a newer OS...then I have to update again and I may face this issue again.

b) Take screenshots of all my playlists every so often so I can remember what they were and remake them? This seems super lame but I guess it could work although it would be a massive time suck.

c) Use a better music organization program? This is what I am leaning toward but I would prefer to not lock myself into something like Rekordbox, in case I want to switch to a different brand of controller later on. Does anyone have any recommendations?   
c) Any other suggestions or tips?"

"I'm trying to load my USB drive into my Pioneer CDJ2000nx2 and it keeps telling me to format the drive and not recognising it. The drive is formatted in FAT-32 as it should be and when uploading my music from Rekordbox to the drive it is doing so with no issues. When I look at the drive on my laptop all the music files are there and playable.   


I have the latest version of software on the CDJ and also Rekordbox, and the USB is brand new and recommended to use with the CDJ - SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD.  


I used SanDisk Ultra Luxe prior to these USBs and they were writing fine but then crashing when plugged in (going on emergency loop) and then all the content data was wiped (artist, playlist, album etc) and I was just left with a single contents folder with all my music in there. 

I'm not sure if the issue is with Rekordbox or the CDJs, but it would be strange for both decks to have the same issue which makes me think its Rekordbox or how my Mac is writing to the drives.

"I hope this isn't the wrong sub for this kinda question. If it is, please feel free to remove the post.

I record my vinyl in 24bit/96khz for archival purposes. I used to have a Rane TTM56, through which i recorded my vinyl via XLR into my Roland Cakewalk UA25-EX set to 24R (to record in 24bit/96khz). This worked like a charm.


I recently bought a Seventy Two MKII and was baffled to see, after checking the spectrals in Audacity, that it only outputs 48khz. After asking Rane support about this they told me that the Seventy Two has an internal soundcard which only outputs 48khz.


So my question is: does anyone know a method (without having to void the warranty) to bypass the internal soundcard in the Seventy Two MKII?

Any help is greatly appreciated."
"I'm going to be playing at smaller music festival (around 3000 people) in my home country and it'll be my first time playing on a big stage separated from the crowd.

All the club shows I've done, I've been on a slightly elevated platform but close enough to lock eyes with individuals and high five people.  I feed off the energy from people's reactions and it informs my set, allowing me to build highs and lows and get in tune with what's working and what isn't.

**What advice do you have on playing to a crowd on a stage that big?**  

I'll be going on at 9:15 to 10:30, the festival ends at 2AM.  I have the perfect time slot to build the crowd up and get them pumped for the last 3 artists.  I don't want to plan my set before hand too much because I'm not a headliner so I can't trust that everything I want to do will work. 

Right now the gameplan is assume the majority of the crowd is still coming in, use the first 15 minutes to play popular songs / edits that invite people to the dance floor, ramp up to 3 or 4 different bangers, then taper off for the last 10 minutes to cool the crowd done for the next artist."

"I DJ at a 200-300? capacity venue atleast a few weekend nights a month which also have live bands either Friday or Saturday nights, sometimes both. How the scheduling goes is the DJ plays a warm up set for the first hour then the band plays, DJ plays during their set breaks and the last hour of the night. Lately the venue is pushing the idea of whoever the DJ is should be handling the live sound for the band from sound check to finish. Currently, they are paying someone next to nothing to get by but are looking to let them go soon. Some bands bring their own sound guys. The rotation of djs have very little live sound experience and aren’t there often enough for training to really stick in my opinion. For the djs, we are getting paid the normal market rate to play for a few hours in between the bands. Venue has a nice pa and lighting system.

My thoughts on this:

#1 DJ’s are not live sound techs. Obviously there are live sound techs that DJ on the side and vice versa.

#2 I believe the venue should either hire a dedicated sound guy or require all bands to bring their own. Given the amount of money this place makes I can’t see this going over budget. Having any band come through and sound great every time as oppose to having a DJ struggle through a rushed sound check and trying to troubleshoot things like feedback, mic placement, changes in crowd density that can effect the mix throughout the night. Customers do and will take notice. 

Thoughts and advice would be much appreciated on this 😊

"Hey fellow DJs, I’m working in a corporate setting which my colleagues doesn’t know that I DJ or at least used to. Recently I’ve been thinking to get back into dj’ing and was thinking would it be good to have 2 different “identities” online. One as a normal office salary man and another one as DJ.

"Okay guys so sorry for the long kind of rant post I think my ADHD is just getting the best of me. 

Allow me to go ahead and spit it all out here, so long story short; I’m a DJ who is also the producer DJ in a dance pop duo and we’re based in both Tokyo, Japan  and Christchurch, New Zealand which is why we’re not actively playing shows ATM. However, I think any DJ will relate to that you moment when you have a new project to work on and you start daydreaming about your dream set up.

Recently, I’ve been going back-and-forth as well as making some progress on my set up. 

I’m definitely someone who would consider themselves a producer / dj as opposed to dj / producer and I would also consider myself a controllerist by nature. (My first foray into dj-ing was “scratching” and playing samples over nu metal songs with the dm2 mixman  my parents bought me for Christmas back in the early 2000’s -_-0) 

I mention all this to paint a picture of my dj-ing style. I love using the gear in a “band dj” kinda way. I’ve dj-ed in several bands and also bring my S4 to club events so I can maintain my playing style. 

Anyways, as I mentioned before I’m starting to day dream about my dream set up for my new dance pop duo as we are finishing up our debut EP and my wife is “allowing”me to splurge on gear. 

The goal would be to have a four channel set up so that I can use three tracks per song (live version of the song, a hot cue scratch track, along with a scratch track for scratching) and then have an extra track to use as an interlude in between songs. 

I also love kinetic energy, via motorised platters, but I don’t necessarily need four of them. 

I would love any input on which set up idea you think would suit my needs best. 

Tracktor Kontrol S4 mk3 with two Rane 12 mk2s (Along with a 13 inch MacBook Air with an external monitor, I have poor eyesight )

Or 

Denon Prime 4+ with two SC6000m primes 

I’ve already bought the S4 and the MacBook Air, for another project of mine, and bc I needed a laptop. But I wouldn’t mind taking my time to invest in a set up that would bring out my creativity in a live setting. 

I also plan to use this set up for writing music for this specific project as I want to be able to create with the tools that I will use to play the songs back.

I originally wanted the two Rane 12s but I don’t like the fact that the hot cues are placed at the top of the unit and I feel that that might kind of take me out of my flow when it comes to playing hot cue parts and  scratching. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. "
At what point should i get a second usb/ssd. I currently have a 1tb ssd card. Last gig i had it was on some cdj 2000nxs. They were having trouble and i wasn’t sure if it was due to my 3.0 ssd.

"If you know, you know. Was quite the introduction to the scene! 

Previously living in small town NZ the only night spot (I won't call it a ""club"") that played dance music in any form was just a guy cross fading tunes on non-cdj CD players, no actual mixing... And according to the bumblefuck locals, ""don't go there, it's a gay bar!"" 🙄

"Hey,

My current setup is 2 xdj700s (not running HID) running into channels 3/4 of an S4 MK3, with the S4Mk3 running the supreme screen hack, with the intention of using decks A/B for stems/ remix decks.

I'm also using beat link trigger software to sync traktor as a slave to the XDJ700s via ableton link.

Due to the supreme screen hack being broken for stems/ remix decks on the s4mk3 &amp; usage of ableton link to sync up those 2 decks with the XDJs, it defeats the point of having the s4mk3/ jogwheels on that channel, I'm also looking to get more comfortable with pioneer mixers effects units for when playing out, and having a setup that's easier for friends to plug and play with, so the switch seems to make sense

The intention is to sell the s4mk3 &amp; purchase a pioneer mixer (750mk2/ 850/ 900nxs), all of which appear to have USB soundcards, meaning I can run Traktor in 2deck external mixer mode, sending the 2 traktor decks to 2 decks on the pioneer mixer via USB, and having the 2 XDJs running into the other 2 channels 

In order to control those 2 decks within traktor (2 stem decks or 1 stem deck + 1 remix deck), I'm unsure if a single F1 would be enough, or if i'll want an F1 + X1 or 2 F1s

Ideally i'm looking to still use the internal traktor FX on individual stems channels too, but I could possibly just map an LPD8 if needed

Any thoughts on the setup would be greatly appreciated :)"

"Got since it came out, a nice Rane Empath fader mixer, to mix mainly techno/prog house on vinyl with 2 Technics MK2's. No digital. (Yes, I'm in my fourties 😁)

I would like to check with you if moving to a Xone 92 would make a big difference in sound quality/mix pleasure?

Or would perhaps adding some modern external phono preamps (genre ART DJ Pre II) to the Empath even get me a better sound VS the Xone?

I only need two channels though. The Xone's 4 band EQ looks to be a nice improvement to sculpt the mixing more, together with the filters and LFO.

Maybe there are other mixers to consider.
Had couple of years ago a Super Stereo DN78 rotary, but found it impractical, no panning, radio interference, imprecise, muddy. I like long mixes, but also fast cutting. So a rotary doesn't look to suit me well.

Please leave me your ideas, so I can move on in my mixing/sound journey. Thanks 🙏

"Hey all, I had my first gig yesterday at a nightclub as the headliner. I planned out a set for 2 hours, and I showed up to the venue early to make sure everything was working (which it was). During my set however, I learned that the play button and a bunch of the hotcue buttons on the controller (XDJ-XZ) weren't working properly. This led to me fucking up transitions a couple transitions during my set (that I've been able to do smoothly practicing many times), and getting some weird looks from the crowd for a few seconds.

My friends after told me that I did well and that they didn't notice anything, but I can't help but feel like they're just saying that to help me feel better. Anyone have any advice for overcoming this feeling? I was really excited for the gig and now that it's over I honestly can't even bring myself to look at my decks. Any advice?

EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect the amount of responses this got. I definitely feel much better reading through a lot of these - I guess I was just really overthinking it.

Hi. Are here people using this mixer? Just wondering what the experience is like having a hp filter as eq. 
I make electronic music in logic but I'm not sure what the process is for performing live. Do you generally just have all your tracks going on a loop and just manipulate and mix them live? Or do you bring in saved samples and just wing it as you go? Having a hard time conceptualizing the transition from recorded tracks solely created in the DAW to a live performance. I also understand that it's all up to the individual what they do as an artist and what equipment you prefer to utilize. Hope that makes sense...

"Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any input on the pros and cons of the Akai unit vs the control one. By using the Control One, you would bypass the need to have the usb dongle for one.   


I have been running the Control One for a few gigs. It works. The thing I don't like about is the touch slider and the mini screen. I don't find it useful during live gigs when I am focused on mixing primarily. I have seen a few people online using the Akai units. What I do like about that is that it has mechanical sliders which would make it easy to dim things on the fly. But I am not sure what the cons of the unit are.   


The control one works within SeratoDJ and VirtualDJ as tested. Not sure if the Akai unit needs some other sort of software running in order to work. The Soundswitch software when running performance mode has the exact button layout as the ControlOne, so its easy to make quick changes and still be able to see what your changing. I know the ControlOne also has dual usb, something I don't use.   


Wondering if anyone could also comment on speed and any input lag etc. I am assuming the Akai gets plugged into the computer usb as as well as the SoundSwitch getting plugged into another USB. The SS plug is where you connect your dmx output to. "

"dear community,

my Pioneer CDJ2000 recently started to malfunction, when adjusting the jog wheel the 'correction' went all over the place. I handed over the unit to a local repair shop, and they offer three options:

1. repair for 480 EUR
2. take the unit back for 105 EUR, not repaired
3. give the unit to Pioneer, free of charge

given the fact that it's a regular CDJ2000 and not a Nexus, there's no sync function and thus I can't bypass the jog wheel for mixing. which of the three options would you pick?

thanks a lot!"
"Stumbled across a couple of threads re cleaning slipmats. So I checked mine and was a bit shocked. Have to say I've not really taken any notice of their condition and I usually mix in lower light in the evening, but on checking they looked shite. Not sure how old they are but it's 3 years ish if I had to guess . Dust covers are on and off.

Immediately picked up some new ones (Dr Suzuki Mix Edition)."
"I need to clean up my 1210's.  Got them new in 94 and only ever used them at home, but although I give them a dust off every now and again, they need a proper clean up. 

There are a few threads on cleaning but I want to make sure I get this right - these things mean a lot to me! What is the best thing to clean the top plate. 

Slightly unique in that the dots you see in pic 2, 3 and 4 are hash oil from many years ago. So I need to remove that and then clean up the top plate - especially to the left of the pitch where it's looking a little worn from all the use over the years.

 Sounds pathetic but these mean a lot to me so I don't want to do anything that would affect/damage the colour (says the guy who in a previous life dropped hash oil on them!).

In pic 5 I have managed to pick up a couple of marks on the base - must have been from when I moved house at some point. 

Should I just use washing up liquid, or anyone have recommendations for cleaning solutions I should use (in the UK).

Oh and yes the tonearm is lifted up in pic 1 before anyone asks!

Thanks"
"A used set with some
Wear and tear, scratches etc  and who knows what of 1200s go for about $1000 around here. On eBay or other sites more like $1200 to $1400. I’ve been looking and ran into what I thought was a good deal of PLX 1000
Used at guitar center. These things are literally mint so I bought them and they work great. Now I sit back and think of 1200s, I’m 48 and started on TTs at a young age and love the name but they’re old and PLX have some nice touches that 1200s don’t. What’s your thoughts on the PLX? Or any superoem? Has anyone  had  a set over 10 years or so? Just looking for some feedback, Thanks in advance. "
"I wrote this as a reply to that other post about Denon DJ now having a shot at becoming ""industry standard"". I don't know why but the post was deleted. Anyway, I'd love to hear what other DJs think of my take, especially those who've come up through the change to digital.

TL;DR - The main reason Pioneer DJ became the industry standard in the first place is because the old standard bearer (Technics) didn't offer what the changing industry wanted. Pioneer will remain in place (regardless of the brand name) until they no longer provide what the industry needs, even if competitors manage to beat them around the margins of price and features.

Original comment: 

Here's my take looking back.

I  think about the last time the ""industry standard"" changed: from  Technics 1200s to CDJs. Pioneer DJ rose during a crucial transformation  in the industry, and their product did something that the incumbent club  standard *could not do*. 1200s  can not play digital music files. CDJs didn't just do what the previous  king did, but better, or at a lower price point. They did something the  previous standard couldn't do\*

So, I wonder, and I suspect, that Pioneer DJ / Alpha Theta / Whatever will only fall off if and when they can *no longer perform the essential function* of the brand leader, which is only this: provide gear that does what the industry wants

\*I realize DVS muddies this argument to some degree, but: I'll maintain  that what Pioneer brought to the table with their players was better  suited to industry needs as the digital revolution marched on. IIRC,  Phase was only launched in 2018, so until then DVS required not only a  laptop, but needles, for chrissakes. Meanwhile the CDJ2000NXS2 was  already out. DJs wanted digital, and the difference between a NXS2 and a  1200 with control vinyl presents a stark contrast between solutions to  that problem. Much more stark than a CDJ3000, and another product that's  marginally cheaper and marginally better. Know what I'm saying?

"I work for a school district and do small dances for some of the schools. I'm definitely not a pro but several years back I bought an electric Swarm light and fog machine to add ambience. Suddenly the Swarm doesn't respond to music. If I tap the rubber grommet it kicks on but it stops even with loud music.  I took it apart and didn't see any signs of broken wires or loose connections, so I'm wondering if the epe microphone is bad or if it might be the sensitive dial.  Does anyone have any idea what I might try for  repair?"
Anyone know how to make the effects figure out  bpms automatically when using regular vinyl (not serato / digital) instead of having to tap it in manually? 
"When I Dj'd back in the late 90's I knew most of the tracks by the record sleeve / label, so flicking through my record box i'd instantly know the tune I wanted to select just by the sleeve it was in or the label on the vinyl, if I had a tune in mind, I could for example quickly flick through until I saw a Perfecto sleeve, or Hooj Choons sleeve etc, knowing that it would be one of them, then finding the exact track. It was more of a visual association with the music and the sleeve.

In this CDJ/MP3 day and age how do you even start to form some sort of fimiliarity with your tracks? I'm sure DJ's have hundreds or thousands more tracks now then if they were Djing when it was predominently vinyl, yea some MP3s have little thumbnail fake sleeve images, but looking on a CDJ or laptop it's just text?, I understand you can have folders, but it's all essentially just lists to go through.

I find it easy to flick through a physical collection and think ""oh yea I try that one"", but I just don't have an association with the music by looking at track titles on a screen, even if I know the artists or title of the tune i'm looking for, anyone else have a similair problem?

Also how many tracks get lost into the ether this way, at least with physical media you have it there infront of you and it can jog a memory while flicking through, not squirreled away on hard drives or lists, never to be played again because hundreds of other tracks have superceeded it? so how do people keep a tabs on what they have, by memorising the artists &amp; track names only?

"Hey there,

I've noticed a lot of techno, house and deep house sets barely have any quiet moments, with DJs keeping the energy high from start to finish. Is this because many DJs choose to mix parts of tracks before hitting the big drop, avoiding the quieter sections?

Curious to know if this is a common technique to maintain the set's energy. How do you handle the dynamics in your sets? Do you skip the quieter parts, or do you play tracks more fully to include a mix of highs and lows?

Would love to hear your strategies and thoughts on this"

I think this genre is Indo House?
"There isn't a shortage of young DJs that meet me and ask me to just give them music... Not a song... Not a few songs... But flat out give them entire genres of music that I worked years to get and find... I view building my catalog as one of the most important parts of being a dj because it's a showcase of ur musical knowledge, and it helps you actually LEARN your music as opposed to just playing some shit that was given to you.

Then it also causes clubbers (at least where i dj) to complain that all the DJs sound the same... So yes, I hate when I'm asked to just send someone my music... Music that I used either my prior knowledge or research to find, pay for, then normalize to a consistent audio level... I'm not an asshole about it when I'm asked... But it's shocking how many do it, and it's a bit annoying tbh because that wont grow you as a dj"

"Both are around the same price on ebay/reverb, so I’m wondering which to get. Is it worth spending more for the mk2 xdjs? "
"Back in 2010s I was a small time DJ that convinced a coffee house to host me weekly for a very niche themed night. Ran it well for about 2 years, a few issues with the venue over equipment and payments caused enough issue for me to have to stop the night.
I posted, letting my amazingly supportive friends know that I wouldn't be able to DJ there for that event anymore.

Here is where the issue lies: I let my ego go. I asked, if they had to keep running the event *I created* without me, if they would please just change the event name. Every bit of promotion for this event was all done by me, everything was tied to me and my Socials, you couldn't bring up this event today without it leading right to me.
 The event was Me being the DJ, so if people come expecting me after I had to quit, they would be disappointed.

I got a lot of push back and vitriol on my ask, but was eventually able to compromise and change the name. The event died anyways not long after I left, and I think it was mostly due to the venue not offering the replacement DJ half of the offer I got, and the one vitriolic pusher being a douch canoe about the event. 

Was it really disrespectful of **me** to ask the event name change because I was no longer able to run it? This is weighing on me as I want to resume my passion, but knowing the people that pushed back, they'll drag this up and start the rumor mill against me if I don't step up and address this first.
I am willing to understand if I am an asshole, I just need concensus."
"I have a few tracks that I feel are absolute bangers and everytime I've played them, the audience loved them. But they are quite unique songs and I always struggle to find similar songs to play after them. How would you overcome this ?"
"Hello, I am a rave DJ  (happy hardcore, gabber, jungle, breakcore, super intense stuff like that is my speciality) I wonder what you guys think of constantly mixing two (or more for 4 channel spinners) songs together at once to make a personalized version of your music and like actually be creating a new thing vs just playing majority to a full song out? like theres many tracks I have that are compelling  enough alone to just play as a full track, but I also feel anxious when I do that because Im not really adding anything new and I get anxious that my audience can tell because its hard to appear busy when im just playing a song?

Curious on what everyone's take is on this. Obviously there are situations where playing full songs are more than acceptable (playing for events, galleries, weddings, parties) where your music is second to the event, but in a situation where you are the main focus as a performer I feel awkward/anxious just playing a song and standing around. is this something I should just not worry about or what?

"Hi guys,

I have been DJing for around 6 months, but been doing gigs for the last 2 months. I have thoroughly enjoyed the gigs I've played, however I always get INTENSE nerves before I start, which leads me to fuck up some transitions and overall perform at a much worse level than I do in my room alone.

"Looking for an RX2 expert to help me work out if I'm being ripped off (intentaionally or otherwise). Took my RX2 in for repair because a CUE button was broken, and mentioned that the fader caps on the two channel faders keep popping off and would it be easy to fix them. A couple of hours later I get an email saying the repair is done with an invoice including two full fader assembly replacements. I called up to query this; they were very apologetic that an internal miscommunication had led to the repair being carried out without my approval, but they were adamant that the full fader assembly had to be replaced. My question is, could this be the case given the faders functioned fine, just the caps kept flying off? I know they use P-lock to attach, so the only way I can see this being the case is if the metal stem of the fader had worn down to the extent that the P-lock could no longer attach. Is this possible/likely?

Frankly if they'd told me this was necessary before carrying out the repair I might have just opted to superglue the fader caps back on rather than pay £35 a piece for new faders. I don't plan to gripe about it though as long as I know there wasn't a cheaper way to repair them properly. Thanks in advance for any input!"
"I'm in the middle of a reno and looking for ideas for a DJ booth that should be around 4ft wide for my own gear, but adjustable to make it wider when friend comes over with his gear on occasion and we play 4 decks with 2 mixers. I'll have less space after the reno is done, so that's why I'm looking for an adjustable booth that can be out of the way and as small as possible when not in use, but very quick and easy to expand out when the moment arises.

I use a Xone 96 and CDJ 2000's w/ MasterSounds FX + isolator and he uses a Rane MP2016 and XDJ1000's, so we probably need 84"" of total width when he comes over.

He's an inch or two shorter than me, so the side he DJ's on can be a bit shorter if needed, which would help it tuck into my side when it's not needed.

I was thinking about either a 'swivel' design or a 'booth in a booth / nesting table' design. Pics below for some context. Either way, any design would need to be strong enough to support the gear and must have heavy duty castor wheels to allow them to move around.

I figure there must be some pretty interesting ideas for working in smaller spaces.

Any suggestions for booth designs you have seen that could work?

Thanks very much!

"I see lot of DJs neither sharing tracklist nor answering to track ID requests resulting in zero visibility for the producers.

I think it's such a selfish act, without producers there won't be any DJing.

I got it, you spent lot of time digging that gem, and when it comes to an old forgotten record, why not, but most of the time it's recent stuff and for big DJs with mostly tracks directly sent to them, so why not showcasing the ones making what you do possible?

I think that DJing is about sharing what you love, so share it?"
"Personally I think a good song doesn't need my help outside of putting it on and picking the next song so I like the full songs without effects or added beats.  But I am fascinated by quick-mixing because it seems so antithetical to what I grew up with going to clubs.  The first time I heard it done was so upsetting to me as a music fan because some of the best parts are at the end, especially if somebody like Patti was on vocal duties.

I am very curious about quick-mixing (especially hip-hop) vs full songs, beyond personal preference.  Do audiences prefer it or did DJs just start doing it (to look busy or something) and people expect it so DJs do it because people expect it because....

Are the songs (in general) these days just not good enough to play it all out?  But I hear people quick mix classics too and it feels so odd to me.   They used to play out a song like Taana Gardner's Heartbeat or Lil Louis French Kiss til the end but not anymore it seems.

What is the theory behind quick-mixing that has made it so prevalent? 

On the flip side is playing full songs of say deep house or trance. For example La Tour Hypnomaia is a track that has high and lows and slow parts and other weird sheet going on.  But a lot of stuff people say the play entire tracks of I sounds like burning man music and just stays in one place for ten minutes with no real journey.  Even Icy Lake by Dat Oven seemed to go somewhere even if it was pretty repetitive.

Anyway just a DJ here wondering the whys."

"Hey, I'm struggling with a new mixer choice, I'm after some help from you lot, mainly in terms of what you have experienced and what is important to you.



Background - I'm in the UK. I have my trusty 1200's which are nearly 30 years old, 2 x XDJ1000mk2's, a CDJ1000mk3, Circuit Tracks, EFX-500.

* In the mid 90's: Just 2 channel Synergy crap mixer
* Late 90's DJM-300
* This decade: DJM-450
* Then a DJM750mk2
* Dabbled with an Ecler WARM2

The 1st WARM2 didn't play nicely with my Korg mini effects unit, the 2nd WARM2 popped and broke, as such I have no faith in another one.

The 750mk2 is capable, but it doesn't sound amazing. Also the effects are.....well, junk. I like the echo, and that's probably the only thing I use in earnest. The colour FX sound terrrible to my ears....ok, noise is fun to play with when you cut it in and out, but that's it. Dub echo and the filter are unusable.



So, I have a fair amount of kit, but don't always use it all together. I like rotary, that would mean Mastersounds Radius 2 / 4 given I'm in the UK, potentially an Ecler WARM4. I like the idea of the Xone PX5 as want that analogue sound, the effects all sound very similar, but hey...I like an echo!

The DJM A9 is a no. The V10 - dunno. Xone 92 is a hard pass as is the 96.

So, what else am I missing?



Is it really down to:

1. Radius 2 / 4
2. Xone PX5
3. WARM 4

"Hey guys. I have been doing small gigs for a while now; playing for 20-100 people on a couple of gigs a year, mostly through friend connections or referrals. Due to this I have been booked for a bigger party in April (500-1000 people). The thing is that I have almost exclusively played on my own gear (Serato + DDJ-SB2) in all of my gigs over the years. But now I have to use the big CDJ’s (2000 or 3000’s idk yet) and I am looking for some advice. 

Things I have done to prepare already:
-Bought some good USB-sticks for my music
-Downloaded Rekordbox and put my Serato crates on there and flashed it to the USB’s
-Bought a second-hand DDJ-400 so that I can use Rekordbox DJ to practice with my new library (a lot of tracks are in different places than Serato)

I have always just turned up, put down my gear and started playing, I can play for 6 hours with all the music I have, which I have done plenty of times. But now I am playing 1 hour on gear I barely know (aside from yt videos). 
I have used CDJ2000’s once before in an empty room for about 30 mins but that only gave me time to know my sticks work and to get to know how the library scrolling works lol. 

Any advice, tips, links,… on how to prepare and deliver one hour of awesome mixing on this new gear? Things to watch out for as to not make the night come to a grinding halt due to technical issues like the “emergency loop” I heard about?"

"Hello everyone :) 

Last night I was playing on the above CDJs in a club in London, I had all my tracks prepared so that they start with hot cue loops and ended on active loops. Tried them all on my XDJ 700s and they worked fine. 

On the CDJ 2000 NXS v1 decks the only way I could exit each loop was if slip mode was turned on, otherwise the 'reloop exit' button would do nothing and I’d be looping forever.

 However, then the only way the active loop would work was if slip mode was turned off again, otherwise it would ignore the loop altogether. Then it would have to be on again so you could exit the loop again…

So this meant I had to learn this behaviour quickly (after a few embarrassing mixes) and remember to turn it on-off-on for every mix I did… so much more confusing than on the XDJ 700 and XDJ 1000 decks that I’ve used.  

Is this how all CDJ 2000 NXS (v1 &amp; v2) decks work? Or were these just acting strange? 

They were a bit battered and the sound tech guy didn’t know how to connect the monitor to the mixer so I don’t have much trust in the venue to know what they’re doing!

I tried researching it but couldn’t find anything that matched what I experienced… thanks in advance!"

"Hello, I have a stanton m.207 that when turned on remains as it is in the attached image, all the buttons are lit in red and it does nothing. Does anyone know why he does that? They told me that it is a PCB problem, but I can't find any information about it or any service manual.

"TL;DR: Producers keep producing amazing songs and DJs keep mixing amazing songs

So I just wanted to word vomit something I've been thinking about in regards to producing and DJing. I myself am not a producer though I surely will make the plunge to find my own voice in that realm eventually. So that means I mostly focus on my mixing and curation skills to make my sets feel dynamic and new. For me I find most of my satisfaction with DJing to be when I forget trying to easily flow from one into/buildup/breakdown to the next and simply try to make the songs ""talk"" to each other. What I mean by that is... think about your own voice, you know the sound of it so intimately and you know the almost imperceptible changes that happen to your voice on any given day. As Producers you are making tracks that feature your voice and they are what get you moving and it's a beautiful thing to witness. Now think to when you are with your friends/family/coworkers... to hear other people's voices and how they react to you and even react to themselves when they are around others. There's an almost childlike wonder in that discovery right?? So for me I like to see how other people's voices (songs) react with a each other and mix through both of them for as long as I can maintain the ""conversation"" and like the natural flow of a conversation there are points where one party is dominating and other points where it's a harmonious back-and-forth and that's how I see myself as a DJ. Don't get me wrong everyone has therlir own style when it comes to showcasing their work but since I don't necessarily have work of my own the way I can find my ""voice"" in DJing is finding that happy centerline between 2 or more songs that create this ""conversation"" in the mix that can't be replicated truly unless you record it because with that I don't like finding one flow within a Playlist and that is my set like a child I like to choose new things try different combos so it's all the same Playlist but never the same songs together so I can find different ""conversations"". I'm not sure if this will resonate with Producers and DJs of the like but all I'm saying is your (producer's) voices while amazing separately are brought up to an even higher level when they are allowed to ""communicate"" with others to even further show the oneness that is your voice (song)."
"I just got a Numark Mixstream Pro+.  


While it's not necessary, it's recommended to download Engine DJ to manage and analyse music tracks ready for playing on the Mixstream. Engine DJ isn't available on Chromebook, which is what I use.

Is there any other track analyser software that is available for Chromebook and compatible with Numark?"
"[Book Club Radio DJ Set](https://youtu.be/hwAl-VcZeCA?si=7xhmvA1zMpCiSeqs)

I notice they have song ID's for every track in the scroll bar. I know this question has been asked many times, but i'm seeing more youtube dj mixes like the ones above from Book Club Radio. But have the rules changed? How is this possible, is it possible for anyone? Can you just ID your tracks and the mix will remain active / uploaded? "

"I was wondering out of curiosity if anyone knows the origin of cheap brands of DJ equipment as for example I once had American Audio CD players like this one:

"Some back info
i have been djing since i was 9 years old currently i am 20. I primarily play hardcore and techno which are the most popular genres where im from. I have been also been producing those genres for about 6 years. The producing is going really well, i have about 60 releases 7k avg monthly listeners on spotify and if you add all the numbers up around 2m streams. 650 followers on insta and thats about it. 

What i’ve tried so far:

Networking 
Ive been networking for years but im not all that great with people it seems, I’ve just been talking to people or at least trying to. I’ve been going to mostly smaller parties in my area seeming with bigger parties its impossible to even get close to djs. I do get to play at some house parties every 3 months, but this isnt really getting me anywhere seeming usually theres about 20-50 people there.

Emails, emails upon emails.
Long emails, short emails, casual emails, business emails, mass emails, personal emails etc etc etc

Talent gigs and competitions 
I landed quite a few of these over the years and won a few prizes, but it all ended the same met new people but nothing happened

Radio gigs/livestreams
Played about a dozen of these, really fun to do but so far no luck at landing actual gig

I can go on with things ive tried, but i think you get the point. The reason i put it here in the first place is to avoid having to type that 20 times trying to explain it to people in the comments. Ive put my entire life on music, studies etc but its getting so depressing the last months.

Anyways i would really love to hear your suggestions!"
"Just looking for some more insight.


So a buddy of mine was saying for me to not use a 256 gig usb that I have formatted as my storage for my music for gigs cause not all devices read over 16 gig or something

What does everybody use or had issues on other models of cdj’s that I know to look out for in the future "
"I just got asked from a local high school to DJ their prom in a few months. They told me that they wanted variety from their last DJ (not surprising since most DJs in the area have had the same playlist for the last 15 years). They said that they usually get charged $500 for an 8-11 gig. 

This event is in the downtown area, which is roughly 30-45 minutes from me roughly. They are expecting around 1,100 kids to attend. I’m a mobile DJ that has experience with dances from the 300-400 range, but not enough equipment for this setup. I’m going to have to rent some equipment for adequate sound. This means the additional work of grabbing the extra equipment and making several trips. 

I know I'll have to ask for more than $500 for this gig, but how in the hell does somebody charge $500 for an event this size. I would love if somebody could find any rational reason for this cheap price and how they could provide enough sound at this size. What would be a reasonable asking price?"
"2 Issues arise when playing a track on my XDJ-700:

1. The track is skipped through at a mental speed immediately after being loaded in. I can't pause/cue whilst it's playing (the buttons still work though).

"EDIT:  
Hello everyone,

I'm in need of some advice to optimize my setup involving an NS4 Numark DJ controller, an Apollo X4 UAD interface, and a MacBook Pro. My goal is twofold: achieve zero latency for my DJ controller and utilize the Apollo X4 to route Autotune and other vocal mixing effects through microphones during live sessions.

Current setup details:

* NS4 Numark DJ controller connected to the MacBook Pro via USB, requiring separate power.
* Apollo X4 UAD interface connected via Thunderbolt 3.

The issue I'm facing includes a slight, yet noticeable lag when using DJ apps, and I'm unable to use the headphone jack on the controller for cueing. Moreover, I want to simultaneously connect my DJ controller and Apollo interface to manage live vocal effects efficiently.

I believe the challenge lies in the specific routing or configuration needed to use both the USB controller and audio interface together seamlessly, especially for live vocal processing through the Apollo.

Does anyone have experience with this kind of setup or any insights on eliminating latency, enabling headphone cueing, and effectively routing vocal effects? Your suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help!"
"So…. I know I’m going to get skewered on this thread. But after a 20 year long hiatus from DJing I decided to slowly try getting back into it, if anything just to mix for myself. A foolishly bought an old Numark NS6 off eBay before really doing my home work and now I’m very aware it’s a dead dinosaur. I even bought a 2011 MacBook Pro with 10.13 software and a legacy version of Seratos ITCH (v2.2.2 I think) to see if I could resurrect it from the techno grave bit so far no luck . Before I turn it into a massive boat anchor has anyone been able to keep there’s still going (for what reason I don’t know) or is it really a lost cause?"
"I’ve found mixing at my fraternity’s events can get pretty annoying to be honest. Majority of the people don’t understand that if I don’t have a song downloaded I can’t play it.

Pawsa, matroda, cloone, mochakk, Michael bibi, all of these absolute studs who create masterpieces for people’s ears. And no one gets up to that type of music at a frat party (obviously).

But I can’t seem to find any great YouTube tutorials on beginning to produce house music with a Akai midi mini controller.

"Hey,

So recently I finished a mix and shutdown my Denon SC Live 4, pressed confirm on shutdown UI notice before realising I hadn't saved the mix :( . Luckily I was able to get it back and wanted to share my experience for others who might get into this little mess.

I thought at first the file would be deleted as nothing was on my usb. Had no idea where to start with all these data recovery sites as most are just BS and want your money. Luckily I found something called Recuva. Same company that makes CCleaner which you might of heard of and I've used for years, which I was surprised at.

Got the usual message about paid version ect ect but got the free version instead, don't waste you're money. Free one had what I wanted anyways, to get my mix back. Installed and ran the recovery search, hoping and hoping it was there. Didn't use their ""deep scan"" as it said about extended time to scan.

After a little while it showed some of the files I deleted before and luckily the mix was there! Pressed recover and checked it and was all good!

Of course not everyone may be lucky in getting their mix / tracks back but I wanted to share this as I'm sure there'll be someone in the future with the same issue. There's lots more data recovery software out there, probably hundreds of different software that work great too, this is just what worked for me.

(Not sure if this works with pioneer controllers but hopefully it does!)"

"Okay so far I've gotten a reputation for asking stupid questions here, please bare with me.
So at this one club I've played a couple times, djs always have the channel gain juuust below clipping, on average gain knob just a smidge below 12. (dnb)
But the promoter always have the master turned up all the way to the max and the master level vu shows it's constantly clipping if I turn it down the slightest, as soon as he sees, he turns it back up.
From what I understand, even if the channel gains are fine, you should also still keep the master out of the red. Am I missing something here?
Is it even worth purchasing lossless files for these gigs then? 😂"

What all do I need to know about booking an artist like this? I told him to included travel &amp; amenities in his booking price and want it to also be a flat rate so no matter what they get paid correctly and they don’t have to worry about ticket pricing/merch. 
Will they bring there own set up gear? We’ll have lights and speakers but what am I missing?

"It's performance day, or the day before, and you're feeling worse and worse by the hour.

As a solo DJ and no one else on your team, what policies, contract terms, and procedures do you have in the event of being so ill you can't perform/MC (such as a wedding or 4+ hour event)? I'm talking, you have to run to the bathroom to throw up or expel your bowels, sick."
"About 2 years ago I got tired of playing shitty parties on my controller where i need to play a buncha music I hate. I decided to sell my controller, buy turntables, accumulate a few hundred records, and mix exclusively on vinyl. As a result, I got super good and have moved from doing occasional parties to gigging on a weekly basis.

I bought an S9 last week tho after coming into some will money and have been LOVING it and decided i wanna bring it to my 2 gigs this weekend. That being said, I'm nervous about tech failing or something else going wrong. 

Ik this is a 2006 ass question, but what tips do you guys have for a first gig on DVS?

Update: Shit got snowed out. So instead my first gig on serato will be sunday in a basement"
""
"Last week i had a voluntary 4 hour gig for our group of about 100 people during a holiday trip. I would bring my laptop with rekordbox and my music, some speakers and simple lights, and a friend would bring a DDJ-800, so we could have a party with the whole group.

Normally i always prefer to use my own gear, but i have an Opus and a FLX4; the opus is way to big to bring on a holiday and the FLX4 is a bit basic, so the DDJ-800 would be a great step up from the FLX4.

At the evening of the party, we are setting up the speakers, lights and eventually the DJ setup. However, at that moment we found out that the power adapter of the DDJ-800 isn’t working anymore! At that moment we tried to find a computer shop for a replacement power supply and drove over, but unfortunately it was hard to find a universal power supply with the right connector.. Even when we found one with the right connector, it didn’t connect that well, and didn’t provide a steady connection. (a small bump against the cable or connector resets the controller)

At that point we had a few options:

* Cancel the party
* Playing music through spotify
* Try to play/mix music in rekordbox with keyboard and mouse

This is where i was getting quite frustrated, i was really looking forward to this party, had some great tunes prepped and was ready to raise the roof!

Cancelling wasn’t really a option, the group was expecting a party and looking forward to it.

So I decided to do the party with rekordbox without a controller…

I almost never play through rekordbox (i prefer standalones), so that would be quite a challenge.

In the small time I got left, I looked up the hotkeys for cue/play, so I could start a track with the keyboard and then mix with the crossfader using the mouse. No EQ’ing possible, but i’ve got to play the cards I got dealt…

Then I even found out it wasn’t even possible to prelisten to tracks. Even though i had rekordbox hooked up to an external mixer with USB, i was expecting to be able to use the internal soundcard for prelistening.

When the party started, I needed a few tracks to get the hang of using the mouse and keyboard for mixing, but i got there.

It was an all-round party, so luckily i didn’t need to beatmix every transition. I used beat sync for the beatmatched transitions and kept them short because i couldn’t use EQ.

I know my music quite good, so i could pick tracks without prelistening, and used the waveforms to ‘read’ the tracks and decide on starting cuepoints. (for some tracks they were already set)

In the end we had a great party! Maybe not the best transitions, but the whole group enjoyed the tracks and had a great evening! I never want to mix with keyboard and mouse again, but i’m very happy it worked out quite fine.

This party just confirms again that mixing skills and gear are really not the most important, it’s all about track selection and track knowledge.

Could the party be better with the controller? Yes, probably! (and a lot easier!) Would the crowd notice? I don’t think so, most of the group didn’t even notice I was playing just from my laptop.

TL/DR: Had issues with the controller when setting up the gig, played the gig with mouse and keyboard without being able to prelisten. Still blew the roof off! It’s all about the tracks ;)"

"Hi all, all im tring to achieve is to be able to post good quality audio recordings of my records on my instagram. So im trying to figure out a way to get audio into my phone. No live streaming, just want to be able to open the camera app or insta and record a video with good audio.

I have a XDJ XZ and a Pixel 8 Pro. I have tried both the iRig Stream Solo and Rode SC4 cable but no joy. The recordings are still coming straight from my phone mic. Frustrating thing is, I have an old iPad Mini and that works absoluely fine.

I have aso tried on a Samsung S21 and an A32 but the same thing. I do get the LED power light on the iRig when i plug it in to the phones.

I've tried multiple USB C adaptors all DAC and also accessed the developer settings and tried disabling/enabling USB audio routing but no joy.

Im all out of ideas and getting really frustrated...it should'nt be this hard lol!!

Im going to try the Rode Al-Micro, possible the Roland Mix but I have a feeling I'm going to get the same outcome. Im wondering if there's anything I've missed in the phone settings.

Just wondered if anyone had any ideas on anything I've not tried or can suggest a different option that will work? Thanks"

"I love djing and have so much fun while i’m spinning at the club, but when I go out normally I just don’t have a great time and find myself just studying what the dj is doing, giving critique in my head.  Anyone else feel this?

EDIT:  I have no issue partying when seeing really good djs, saw Chris Stussy late last year with my buds and didn’t stop dancing for 2 hours straight, it’s when i go to normal clubs with smaller djs with the same (or lesser) experience as me that this happens"
Just a question that triggers my noodle. But when do djs start playing classic tracks from the past. I asked this because most guys will play all of this newer stuff. But when they hit a certain age like their 50s. They start playing old tunes that they use to play. I asked this because I'm 32 years old and I'm not ready to throw in the old school in my dj sets just yet.

I'm currently running a vinyl-only setup at home with a Xone 23 and turntables. I'm now very close to picking up a Traktor Z2 so I can play a mix of vinyl and DVS. My only concern is that there may be a drop in sound quality when playing vinyl.

Can anyone comment on the quality of the Z2's phono preamps? If anyone has experience playing vinyl through both the Z2 and Xone 23, I would love to hear about your experience.

I'm under no illusions about the quality of my setup - my current gear is low-budget, but sounds decent enough to me. I'd like to keep things sounding nice.

"At least according to this editorial in RA. 

Two things:

1. Kyle Chaka is an OG tech journalist and is worth reading
2. A few key quotes below:

&gt; In his new book, The New Yorker staff writer Kyle Chayka outlines why he thinks algorithms are ruining a person's ability to develop unique taste. Mathematically determined recommendations on social media, streaming and other platforms are deciding what music, food, art and entertainment becomes popular, he explains. The algorithm promotes the widest possible average, ""informing the songs we listen to, the friends with whom we stay in touch,"" he writes, warning that culture is getting homogenised as a result.

Also from another quote:

&gt; Monoculture is stronger than ever, he noted, pointing to how people across the world are consuming the same narratives and aesthetics being pushed across mainstream media. 

&gt;""That's not where I listen to music or look for music–I go to gigs, I listen to radio and I talk to my friends,"" he said. ""Subculture is just nowhere near the stuff we're being shown.""

That last paragraph is gold. 

Moral of the story; don’t equate streams with success (or even quality). And don’t get your music from top 100 playlists."
"I have an XDJ-RX2 that has a semi-functional headphone jack, only supplying audio to one ear. Otherwise everything else is in great shape. This part seems to be around $50 from various suppliers. I live in Seattle and the nearest Pioneer service center is in Glendale, CA - not worth shipping it back and forth just for this repair. Has anyone swapped out this part before or even just cracked open an RX2 and could offer any advice for self-repair? It looks like a deceptively simple swap, which makes me wonder what I'm missing. I've seen a few threads on successful self-repair of the RZ which is a more complicated controller, so I'm hopeful the RX2 is straightforward enough to repair myself."
"Was checking out a few new tunes, and I'm finding it strange when I see so many supposedly new ""club"" tunes are more very short versions, like 2 1/2 to 3 minutes long, and a supposedly ""extended"" version is 4 minutes. Plus I see many with no intro or outro like we normally get

What the hell?  Used to be a club track we'd buy is like 5-8 minutes long.  Did I miss something?

I went looking and heard ""TikTok"" but I find this ridiculous for club music to be so short like that."
"Call me paranoid but I think the USB-C ports on newer DJ gear are going to potentially be a point of failure. This is mobile-spec port which is *relatively* durable but is still not as durable as the old USB Type B connector. My solution to this is [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0B8X6H96S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).

My idea is this: get these adapaters, plug them into the USB-C ports on the decks and leave them connected. Plug my USB-C cable into the adapter rather than the port of the deck. This will save wear on the port. If the adapter starts to wear down, no biggie, i can replace the adapter and i'll be good to go for another x-y years. This potentially avoids the need for sending off the decks for USB-C repair, or dealing with awkward intermittent connection issues.

I'd be interested to know your thoughts anyways, cheers all.

Hey everyone. My old mixer of 15 years finally bit the big one so I'm looking for a new one.  I don't really need any thing fancy. I basically use my phone for beats and scratch using vinyl on one turntable. Basically just need a smooth cross fader and some audio imputs. Been out of the loop for a while so I'd appreciate any recommendations. Thanks!
Any suggestions? When I started out digital kits weren’t really even a thing yet. Now I’m hoping to find a setup that makes me feel like a kid again by giving me something sorta close to spinning techno on my old Technics. But I’m also an old dude with no illusions of old grandeur. So I’m just hoping for relatively inexpensive options so as not to make my wife mad. Love to cut some break beats again. Thanks fellas!

"By the looks of it, maybe this isn't that popular. Haha

I'm looking to play a local club that turns into a lounge on weekdays. It's a great vibe although the lighting isn't as dark as most are used to in a club/semi-club setting. Obviously turning the lights down at a lounge isn't the best idea. 

I feel like a mister/hazer/fog/haze machine (NOT SMOKE) could really improve the vibe, even if there's no lasers or lighting being employed. I swear I've seen a constant hazy state at super clubs like Stereo and think it could really add to the atmosphere the promoters are after."

There are analogue DJs, there are Digital DJs. There are performance DJs, there are jukebox DJs. there are wedding DJs, there are turntablists. 

Corporate HQ are after concepts to take to the next intergalactic board meeting from the greatest minds on the subject. The 1970s term is no longer valid and the universal label is to be retired upon release of the alpha-theta CDJ 4000.

"I played at a festival over the weekend. I had two sets, one directly after the opening ceremony on the main stage in the evening, the other was Sunday mid afternoon. 

First set was fine. Totally happy with it and the crowd vibed and danced to what I played. 

For the Sunday set, I knew I needed to bring something different, but for it still to be ‘my’ sound. So, as a hip hop/funk/breaks DJ and it being the last day of a three day festival, I complied a laid back collection of slower beats with nice bass lines, that a crowd could sway along to.

The DJs before played Afro house, ecstatic dance and ended with techno. The crowd were really up for it and dancing along furiously. This is when I second guessed my decision and instead of starting my set as I had planned, I dropped some breaks to keep the crowd dancing at the pace that had been set. It kinda worked, but the novelty of raving in the afternoon wore off, so I reverted back to my original plan and slowed it right down to 80-90-100bpm beats and it worked. The crowd swelled in numbers, the head nodding and swaying I had imagined beforehand was happening, and the Sunday summery vibe was set. I just wish that I had trusted myself and not tried to follow on from something that someone else had built.

The lesson I learned? Play what you know will set a vibe. It’s better to play from your heart, than to try and match someone else."
"There are numerous subreddits to upload mixes to but they're all ghost towns when it comes to interaction. I am thinking most of their users are content creators who don't have time or patience to listen to each other's content. Even when I actively try to do this myself, being genuine about it isn't easy. You basically need to dedicate like an hour to listening to someone's mix if you intended to try to provide constructive feedback. 

So the question is, what platform for sharing mixes actually works? IE has an audience for the content created and not just a sea of content creators ignoring eachother?"

"Hi!

I recently arrived in Hamburg since I'll be doing my master's degree for the next two years. I would like to know if there are WhatsApp or Telegram groups related to Techno culture or events in general. Also, groups of Latino people who are interested in Techno would be helpful. 

Moreover, being a DJ from Colombia, mainly focused on hypnotic Techno and Hardgroove, I would like to receive advice on how to get more involved in the scene, to get chances to play in clubs and events possibly. I just find kinda weird and difficult to talk to people at parties because most people want to listen to the music and enjoy the party. Also, I don't speak fluent German, which makes it even harder to talk to people. 

In conclusion, I would appreciate it if you guys know any clubs, collectives, or radios that would be willing to accept new DJs to play. Also, I accept any advice to make connections with other DJs. 

Thank you for reading and for the help!"
"I'm at the point where I want to start creating my own samples for mixes and sets, and I'm wondering how others handle the workflow when it comes to tonal samples like hits or loops (sounds that have a distinct note or key, not atonal like a hi hat). Do you make the same sound in multiple keys (ie, A, C, D, E, G, and G#, etc.), and hope that you have the sample in the right key for the song you want to layer it over, or do you just create 1 sample at 1 key / note, and just go with it? I can imagine that having a sample / sound in multiple keys would be great to have, but the library management aspect of it seems impossible. 

PS - I thought about posting this in r/Beatmatch but ultimately wanted to get the opinion of more advanced DJ's that also make their own samples, or even their own music. Happy to repost it there if that's where this question belongs."
"Color me shocked looking for 7"" record weights and finding that they are at least $100 per unit or simply out of stock. Been buying mostly 7""s recently to keep clutter down. Unfortunately they suffer a bit in loud rooms due to shallower grooves/generally being lighter and more flimsy. 

Am I missing anything? Is there any product out there that is a bit cheaper, or an approach you have found successful for stabilizing 7""s in  loud environments? "

"Hey! In a recent post, I read about the importance of volume levels and how easy it is to damage a sound system.

I know very little about this, so I'm curious about the basics and ins-and-outs of how to make sure that I don't make any rookie mistakes."
This was at a silent disco. Apparently the transmitter was receiving a really quiet signal and the participants couldn't hear it so they pushed the mixer real hard to get the levels to where they can be heard on the headphones.
"As someone with a computer science background who recently ventured into DJing, I’ve encountered several challenges, particularly with the technology used in DJing. After a few months into this journey, I’ve realized that the tech aspect seems lacking.

One major task involves listening to numerous tracks daily. Subsequently, I spend hours analyzing these tracks to determine compatibility, identifying which tracks mesh well together, and exploring various transition techniques.

Would it be accurate to state that one of the primary challenges for DJs, especially newcomers, is the extensive analysis required to find hot cues, and devise potential transition strategies between tracks? It feels like there could be more efficient solutions than manually tagging tracks for vocals, drums, bass, etc.

Am I alone in thinking this, or is this a shared challenge within the DJ community?"

"Started as an MC like 17 yrs ago and started playing way more often since 2019,but i feel like routine has become a problem by a lot.

"Hey all. Been djing on community radio and collecting vinyl for decades. Had my first live gig yesterday and I had a ball and it went great. However, my needles got bent in the process of switching over with the dj after me. They were decent and performed well, but it was about time to replace them. What do folks in the know recommend for an affordable pair of replacement cartridges that I can gig out with? Preferable prices to include a case for transport."
Solar interference from variation in the strength in sunlight means the system would literally produce the sound of the sun.

"When I started to DJ I became a big fan of MixedInKey. Because I made my first steps into the profession with an off project by the same company called ""Flow 8 Deck"" which was a DJ software with some unique features like displaying the different keys  of a track and not just one. 

But soon i reached the limitations of Flow8Deck and moved on to rekordbox with the help of MixedInKey. As a newbie I was still unsure where to put my hotcues and how to beatgrid and MixedInKey helped me with it. 

Nowadays I do not consider the automatic cues of MixedInKey helpful although i still import them with the Cue and Key tool most of the time I end up deleting them. 

This leaves with only the key detection, which is probably good enough to do it just with rekordbox and remove a big part of my new track workflow.

What are your experiences with MixedInKey do you consider it useful?

"Hello, good people.

Based in a country where it's very hard to find mixers. By asking around, I have managed to find two mixers: The Pioneer DJM800 (4 channels) and the NI Traktor Kontrol Z2 (2+2 channels), both used.

My setup is a pair of CDJs and one (but sometimes two) turntable(s). I need a mixer mostly for home use with the occasional gig, but nothing crazy in clubs. Just chill, radio-show-style gigs where I just cue one track after another.

Now the DJM800 is being sold for $370 and the Z2 for $520. The Z2 is in a great condition (purchased in 2018), while the DJM800, while not heavily used, comes with a broken crossfader and a broken knob that needs fixing. I am considering it because I don't really scratch DJ.

My budget is up to $400. Is getting an old DJM800 worth it in 2024? I checked its prices in Japan and it still seems to be in high demand and is going for much higher prices (probably because it has achieved classic status?), but from what I read online, the sound quality on the DJM800 isn't very good and it also doesn't come with a sound card built in?

The Z2 on the other hand doesn't need any repairs, but would I overpaying if I'm getting it for $520? Purchasing the mixer here does cost more than getting it elsewhere because of the import tax laws in my country.

I would really appreciate it if someone here could share their thoughts on what I should do.

Please keep in mind that I can't consider other mixers because they are simply not available in my country right now."
"I recently noticed the last few couples times I’ve played that I’m getting a lot of interference or disturbance with noise.

"Hi guys, not sure if overthinking on this one

I’m a DJ who has been DJing for a few months. Been doing well this year, had a decent amount of gigs in January meaning I am definitely getting somewhere. 

There are some DJs in the space local to my area who are doing really well and I would like to get to know them. However I’m not sure if it’s too pushy (or perhaps cringe) to DM them supporting their work or their latest releases. I want to build connections with them, but don’t want to appear to “fan-like”.

We do Big events and don’t have a dedicated sub, which is the reason i lean more towards the DBRs with the bigger sub. We value higher volume compared to higher quality. Obviously we want it to sound good but it being louder and sounding okay is fine by us. Let me know what you think."

I would like to ask for advice regarding wireless audio transmission. I have an event where I need to place two speakers in different rooms.

"In Search of Chaldean/Assyrian DJ Chicago

Hi Everyone,

I’m trying to find a DJ to host my engagement party but it’s hard finding a DJ who works in my culture(Chaldean/Assyrian). 

Do you think I can hire any DJ and create the playlist with them? Then they can just mix the songs? Or is there a way to search for a DJ who has worked with my culture?

Not entirely sure what to do because I’d of course love a DJ who can speak into the mic to get the crowd more engaged. Love an interactive DJ. So it’s easier to do that if they know the language but if not I understand.  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! 🙏🏻"

My near perfect, ~20 y/o Technics 1210 mk5g’s got absolutely wrecked by corrosion damage.

TLDR: if you own turntables and have been storing them in a case long term, please check them! Consider storing them differently, or at the very least throw some moisture absorbing packets in with them.

"I’ve been a bedroom DJ for 1.5 years trying to get my foot in the door to actually play a gig (which is a wholeeeeeeeeeee nother issue). 
I was wondering when you get out into a venue and you’ve got bookings relatively close to eachother by date, do you play the majority of the same the same songs, Or do you only play some of the same ones you know will get the crowd jumping. Or what is your guyses workaround to keep a fresh set, especially since many people could have heard your last set a week ago…

A big part of being a great DJ is obviously knowing your library in and out but how could you switch up your sets yet still have a full “in and out” understanding of your library in such little time?

EDIT: when I say set I don’t mean a prepared set, i meant a gig. "

"Before the pandemic hit, I would occasionally DJ at this club out of town. The club was new and the town was small. On average, maybe 10-20 people a night. It was bad. Management had no idea what they were doing and their marketing attempts were nonexistent. It didn't help that the other clubs were much more established and had a pretty good monopoly on the area.

Around Christmas time, there's an annual pub crawl called 12 Barz. Each city has their own set of venues and lucky for us, our club was selected as one of the stops. Management decided that this would be a great opportunity to hire an artist to perform and brought in JRDN. Throughout this period, they marketed the event nonstop and made a new JRDN post every day.

Fast forward to the night of the pub crawl, I arrived and had music on for 10. Around 11, the group arrives and the club is fully packed. Everyone's having a great time singing and by 11:15, it was empty again. I don't think the owner realized that they would just be coming by briefly because he looked shocked. JRDN arrived with his crew around midnight and we ended up talking for the rest of the night. He didn't end up performing and no one else showed up afterwards.

This was by far one of the saddest gigs I've ever had. The next saddest gig I had was for a birthday party where the guy rented out a big ass venue and only 10-20 people showed up. In terms of sheer scale, this one was definitely worse. The owner just looked so defeated afterwards that I don't think he ever recovered from that night.

Anyone else have any similar experiences?

Edit: Dumpster fires are appreciated too! My buddy had a beer tossed at him by some redneck uncle and had some guy ram his finger up his ass when his assistant went to pee lol."

"I have been using iTunes/Apple Music for a long time and just bought a new laptop. I backed up my files via Time Machine ready for new laptop. 

Loaded up the Apple Music back-up on new laptop 15% of the catalogue had missing tags, genre, artwork and playlists. I've since gone through every track and updated the tags, removed duplicates etc (not the missing playlists yet). 

Is this a common problem? 

I wanted to organise all my music ASAP (quite organised as all on one place and genre/artist/title tagged) before I load up into Serato/Rekordbox. 

However, now that I have finished updating the incorrect tagged library I am keen to move away from Apple Music and maybe just use folders instead as this has been a hassle and want to avoid for any future back-ups. 

I am considering creating new folders specified by genre/year. Apple Music creates all music as Artist&gt;Album&gt;Title. I wondered, is this as easy as just dragging tracks directly from Apple Music and dropping them into a folder (EG Electronic, Disco etc). Will all tags cross over if I was to do this.

Ideally want to be able to do sort it in a clean way so that any future back are a breeze. 

Final thing - I've read you can't update file names in DJ software (Rekordbox/Serato), so if you do play your tracks from folders only (with no Apple Music/lexicon etc) how do you name your files with the correct genre/artist/title etc? As there is only one box area to update any standard filter on Mac.

"I’m more just curious to see what others think because my friends and gf think I’m nuts. I’ve been DJing consistently for the past 10 years, 2-3 gigs a week, and I still love doing it, with no plans to stop anytime soon. However, one toll the job has taken on me is that because I’m so constantly surrounded by music and spend so much time actively listening for the purpose of screening songs for my sets, I’ve gotten to the point where music in any context outside of DJing is basically noise and I derive no pleasure from listening to it, even within the genres I like playing out. I used to love going to concerts and festivals, but I now find them excruciatingly boring unless I’m either DJing them or analyzing another DJ’s set to help improve my own. So like if I’m driving, working at my day job, at the gym or whatever, I basically never listen to music and instead opt for podcasts or audiobooks instead. I’ll even just put in earplugs and embrace the silence if I really need to focus on something. None of my other DJ friends seem to feel this way, so I’m curious if anyone here has experienced anything similar?"
"This is a very strange problem I have noticed only with certain cdj2000s when using it as a midi controller with Traktor and a usb hub. 

Last night at a gig one cdj2k worked perfect. No issues. 

The other same model with the same firmware only had play/cue/jog platter working.

but did NOT allow me to control the pitch fader. I also couldn't control the button to jump between cues. No amount of resetting the gear or my macbook could resolve this. 

It seems to only be an issue with cdj 2000s. I have tried 900nxs, 900 standard and cdj 3000s without this issue. 

What on earth could I try to get around this in the future?"
"I attended a couple of gigs from beginner DJs and i notice that during their whole set they dont look at the crowd at all, they are burried in their cdj or controller. Whereas, when i attended gigs from more experienced djs i notice that they quite often look at the criwd to check if we are vibing to the songs, sometimes even communicate with the crowd thorugh gestures etc.

Then recently, i was talking to a friend i met on one of the events, and he was speaking of how important to him it is that the dj is ""communicating"" with the crowd, not only with the songs but also with looking, smiling, interacting .

What is your take on this part? Do you check on your crowd during your set and how? If not, why not? If you have any interesting stories on this topic, do share!"

"Hey so this is kind of an awkward / newbie question but for the first time ever I'm in a position where a festival wants to book me for a prime slot and has asked for my conditions.And I feel a little lost on what to answer.

It's not my first international gig but usually clubs and promoters just offer me a certain sum and I accept in any case because I'm just happy to play and visit the country. I have no agency backing me and still feel quite new to all of this (1 year playing official gigs), so I'm not great at negotiating for myself.

I'm not sure if I should ask for the same amount I would get at a local, regular club gig or if international festivals are different? Of course I'm going to ask to have travel expenses and accommodation covered. But should I ask for a higher fee since I'll be traveling for most of the weekend and can't play other gigs as to compensate for the potential loss? The set would only be 2h but I would either have to travel 10h by train or half a day when flying.

What else should I be asking for? I usually just send out a tech rider with my minimum requirements but I've seen other DJs ask for meals, breakfast the following day etc.I want to be professional and not sell myself ""under value"" but I'm afraid of asking for too much just for them to end up ghosting me.... It's a small, local festival but taking place in a rich county in Europe and it seems like they have some funding. They've also invited much bigger names than me in the past so I feel a bit intimidated lol

TL;DR: How to negotiate a fee for international festival gigs as a newcomer DJ?"

So. At the moment  I am rocking a Rane 72 (since 2018) and two CDJ 900 Nexus. I love this setup and I feel pretty good with it. (I am an open format Dj btw) but I stopped with active djing since the pandemic. So actually i was thinking to replace my 72 cause i had bad experience with my Rane 62 that got discounted. So my problem is: should i sell my 72 and „upgrade“ to maybe a Pioneer mixer. Or do you think the 72 will have support for a longer time or will be discounted by a nearby time. I just dont want to have the same experince again that my expensive gear gets discounted. I actually had the idea to even ditch my CDJs and just buy a Controller like the Rev 7 or the DDJ FLX 10. for my home setup it would be great but i dont know if i have the same feeling with a controller again. Would be nice to know your opinion. :)

I know a lot of them too for anybody help me please Thank you guys"
"I'm an old head and haven't spun a club gig in over 10 years. I was mainly a hip hop/open format DJ. I was just talking to an old DJ friend and he told me he quit 2 years ago because he simply couldn't keep up with the sheer amount of music and requests for unofficial youtube/remixes/tiktok songs. 

When I was DJing, Billboard top 40-100 was the backbone of my entire night set. Whatever was at the top of Billboard was my peak bangers that would for sure get the dancefloor filled. So as long as I had all the top billboard songs, I'd be mostly fine for the night.  I'd have a crate my old school classics that didn't really change. 

Then I'd have niche crates for subgenres that were hot at the time like an EDM crate, a dancehall reggae crate, a bmore club crate. To keep up with those it took being in the club bar scene and just seeing how crowds react to these rarer tracks that you don't hear on the radio. It also took a bunch of scouring forums, record pools, and record shops to get my hands on these rarer tracks.

Now billboard is far less relevant. There's not really a singular chart, top 20, or MTV/BET/Radio countdown that you can follow to know what's popular. TikTok and social media dictates alot of what music is popular. Sometimes old songs all of a sudden become popular like Fleetwood Mac Dreams blew up because of that guy skateboarding drinking cranberry juice. There are so many avenues to discover music that it's overwhelming. How are DJ's today keeping up with all of it?"
"Hey all, I am the DJ/ Sound guy for my fraternity. We recently had someone running sound when i was out of town and they broke a Peavey pvx15p, we are now taking the opportunity to upgrade our system. I’m hoping to get some feedback and some recommendations.

What we have now.
Yamaha dbr 15
ev zlx 15
(now only 1) peavey pvx15p
very small yorkville sub
and 3 unpowered monitors (unknown brand)

I’ve looked at the ProReck Club line and just think there is something not all there with the price for what you get. I’ve also looked into the QSC K series, JBL PRX series, and the Yamaha DXR series, and they are just a bit out of our price range. 

We normally throw parties with around 300 people and have outdoor tailgates with anywhere from 300-600 people (during tailgates we compete with other fraternitys sound at the tailgate lots as well) 

Another fraternity that is always next to us uses a column speaker (not sure on brand) and it seems like it produces very good vocals that carry very far.

What would be your recommendations for upgrading our sound system? more of what we have? investing in fixing the peavey pvx15p? Bigger bass? 

Thanks for reading and any feedback/ advice is welcome."

"I've around 2000 dance 12"" vinyl, so a good shelfing help so much to enjoy my records..

as I said in past posts I used to keep 12"" in outer polythene sleeves where I placed paper adhesive tape with BPM.. this method was not good about 'handle' the records: GOOD feel to handle original covers/BAD feel to handle plastic sleeves..

last Sunday a 'destroy raptus' caught to me and I threw it away all sleeves to 'get free' my records :)) and shelf them straight by Alphabet (aside Genre)..

now.. my doubt is if could be useful place a colored dot sticker straight on the original record cover to show Genre (i.e. yellow/Disco, orange/Funk,..)

"I recently had a bit of a nail-biting experience where I spent a long time autoscripting 100+ tracks on SoundSwitch for use with Engine Lighting on my Prime 4, only for the contents of the scripts I made to completely disappear. I thought I had lost a few dozen hours of work, only a couple days before my next gig. I couldn't find any definitive (working) answers on other forums, and support is rather slow given they're on the other side of the globe from me. I figured I'd share the dumb mistake I made and how I fixed it so that someone else may benefit down the road.

\---

**Here are the symptoms relevant to the situation:**

1) You have gone and autoscripted some tracks for use with SoundSwitch.

2) After syncing your library with Engine DJ, your autoscripted songs now show up blank, as if they've never been analyzed or scripted.

3) The ""SS"" logo may still appear in SoundSwitch next to the songs you previously scripted.

4) Clicking ""Rebuild TrackMap"" does not fix anything, and if #3 was true, the ""SS"" logo is now gone as well.

5) When you look in the directory for your SoundSwitch project, you still see plenty of .ssfile and .ssa files.

\---

**Here is what happened in my situation:**

I had foolishly been creating autoscripts \*directly on my Prime 4's internal SSD\*, not on my computer. What this means is that rather than accessing my music library on my computer, which I then sync to my Prime 4's drive, I accessed my music directly on my Prime 4 from SoundSwitch.

*Why this is a problem*

The way SoundSwitch identifies tracks is by inserting a custom metadata tag on each song you create an autoscript for. As far as I can tell, Engine DJ does not sync track metadata back to the library on your computer. Therefore, even if Engine DJ says ""new data to sync"" from your controller back to your computer, it's not going to copy over the custom metadata SoundSwitch inserted when you created a script.

However, when you sync from your computer over to your controller, Engine DJ \*will overwrite\* the metadata for your library, including the songs you created autoscripts for. Since the tracks on your local library don't have the custom SoundSwitch metadata tag, that tag gets erased on your controller during sync. At this point, due to the TrackMap, SoundSwitch will likely still show an ""SS"" logo next to the tracks you created scripts for, but clicking on those tracks will show you a totally empty file as if you haven't done any work. Clicking ""Rebuild TrackMap"" will ruin things further because SoundSwitch will examine your music library, search for its custom metadata tag in each song, find none, and then wipe out all ""SS"" logos because it did not find any music file with the tag indicating it has a script.

\---

**How I fixed it:**

Based on what I've already described, you may have an idea of where this is going. After figuring out how SoundSwitch works with music files, here is what got me back on my feet:

1) Open your song or library directory with a music tag editor such as [MP3Tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/).

2) Click on the track you want to re-attach an automation to and press Alt+T.

3) Click to add a new tag with the name SOUNDSWITCH\_ID. The data field should contain the \*precise\* name of the .ssfile (found in your SoundSwitch project directory) which corresponds to that particular track. For example, if I know that the file {D65B6572-A50F-4C5F-AD6E-8FE1E6546102}.ssfile corresponds with the track in my library called ""I'm Good"", I'd open up ""I'm Good"" in MP3Tag, click it, press Alt+T, add a new field with the name SOUNDSWITCH\_ID and the data {D65B6572-A50F-4C5F-AD6E-8FE1E6546102}.

4) Repeat this for every. single. track. Tedious? Absolutely. Better than losing dozens of hours of work? Also absolutely.

*However, this begs the question... how in the world do you correlate .ssfile names with their respective tracks?*

This is where things get really tricky, and where I honestly got really lucky. I had created a playlist for my gig, and had gone down the list from top-to-bottom creating a script for each track. Therefore, I was able to sort my SoundSwitch project directory by ""Created At"", start with the earliest-created .ssfile, know that correlated with the first track in my playlist, and then move down from there. 

If you created scripts at random, things are going to be much, much harder for you, and you may spend more time trying to match up tracks to .ssfiles than you would just completely re-doing the scripts altogether. Do note, however, that correlating the wrong .ssfile to the wrong track doesn't hurt anything as long as you don't save. You can open it up and it will be very obvious that things don't match up. Looking at the script itself may also help you to know which track it actually belongs to!

\---

**After all was said and done...**

It took me a couple hours to correlate metadata tags to the 100+ tracks. This time, of course, I made sure to create the scripts while navigated to the library on my \*computer\*, NOT on my Prime 4. Things looked good, I synced using Engine DJ from my computer to my Prime 4, and everything finally, finally worked.

Hopefully this helps someone at some point, or even better, helps someone to avoid making the same dumb mistake I did. Needless to say, I've been thoroughly enjoying SoundSwitch / Engine Lighting despite some quirks and needed improvements, and look forward to what they do in the future."
Is there a differnece in the quality between track bought on bandcamp vs beatport?
"So, this appears to be borderline a r/beatmatch post, but hear me out, it’s more nuanced.

Hey. I’m Roman. I live in New York City, and I’ve been a high level nightclub DJ for about five years here. Played in just about every club in NY. people tell me I’m one of the best. I don’t have a big head about it, but I know I do pretty well, and I’m looking for further opportunities to grow, progress, and make money.  I’m feeling stagnant after running laps around the circuit and not getting any further ahead financially. (I’m a full time DJ). I want to devote more of my time to music production, but am in a weird place.

I’m well aware that the real money is in corporate events, traveling and private events, though I have a great website and great visibility in the city, I feel like I don’t have the contacts for this type of work.

I do advertise myself as the cool club DJ on my site -Romanchappelle.com, because I didn’t want to be seen as a birthday party DJ or cheap mobile DJ.  I wanted to be seen as underground and club cool, and am ultimately an artist. it worked out, I built my brand well, and I’m trusted at what I do at many high-end clubs and hotels as well as the underground.

Now I still want to be cool. I produce music, and I travel, playing in aspen next week- but I’m also aware that I feel I’m leaving money on the table by not pursuing more of the right mobile gigs. I have got a few inbounds on my website for events, but not nearly as many as I’ve got talking to people.

I have some equipment I would like to do more high end corp/brand gigs, consistently.  Nike, fashion, Google parties etc. 



I’ve signed up for bark and thumbtack, but I don’t want to do 16 year old birthday parties for 300 bucks. That’s not worth the money I spend on gear and transportation. I can also make that during a club night not bringing any gear, usually more.



I’m looking to work with higher end clients- $1500 and up. Do you all have any experience with PR companies, and larger event producers? Goals are gigs for fashion week, large corporate events, and industry conferences. As a New Yorker I know these things happen every single day and have done work for Tissot, IMG, soho house, etc. The frustrating part is that I am in touch with agents annd agencies, the gigs are just so infrequent that they’re almost 1 a quarter. 

I haven’t broken in consistently yet.

Being vulnerable here, as a full-time nightclub DJ, I sometimes feel like I am struggling to survive financially, even while I am doing the flashiest gigs, and playing the best clubs in the city, and do make $300 an hour more than occasionally.

At this point I’m well aware that my mathematics are in need of more consistent high end clients, and nightclubs just don’t pay the bills. Do I need to be signed to an agency? Should I start my own? Maybe it’s a marketing issue- and if you look at my Instagram, I have removed a lot of my nightclub work because I’m starting to replace it with artist cntent, my own music, and better branding, because I no longer just want to be seen as a nightclub guy.

I’ve already received the basic guidance of check out agencies, network more, etc.  looking to ask for some experienced perspectives. I don’t want to leave any more money on the table. I eventually plan to be able to sell tickets at more major venues, and be more of an artist doing big numbers, but getting there, I have to pay the bills.

  
I am also a copywriter on the side, so I know how to do a bit of marketing. Looking for any smart guidance, preferably from people who’ve done it before. "
"Hi guys! I want a good 4 channel mixer.

"I work at a small club and I get tipped out by the girls, I do make minimum wage. My philosophy is to play for the girls since they are the ones that tip me out, not the guests unless they request a certain song (for money). I hear some other DJ’s try and do a mix of both where they play for the girls and the guests, it seems more likely to piss off the girls.

I’m curious to hear everyone’s take"
"DJs!! I have a question that i’d imagine may have crossed your mind too and am interested in your thoughts:

In my music discovery sessions i often find tracks that sound really great to me the first time, but as I listen a few more times before including them in my sets to make sure they don’t have details i may not like, i end up scrapping them.

Am i being overly analytical? i’m now thinking that if a track sounds great to me the first time, a majority of my audience would likely enjoy it too assuming they haven’t heard it before given i’m digging way deep in the underground world. 

What do yours think and curious to hear how other DJs go about this, TY!"
"I’ve been DJing weddings for around 12–13 years predominantly. Rarely have I run into this situation. There were very young kids 5-10years old. A lot of family in the 50+ range. The dance floor was popping all night besides dessert time. At about a half hour left, the bride insisted I play a certain set of songs “and do not censor! This is my wedding and I don’t care! Make it ratchet!” So of course I obliged and played the requested rap songs. I like all of that stuff but felt it was too explicit in that situation. (And I’m not a prude lol also I don’t don’t play church clean stuff at my weddings either) Most of the older crowd cleared the F out. Curious as to the wedding DJs out there how you feel about that and what you do in that situation?"
"What are your thoughts on limiting drinking and keeping an exercise routine to improve post gig energy levels? I’m a mid 30’s guy and have noticed that playing listening bars and clubs 3-7 times a week can be physically and mentally draining - my lower legs feel sore and some sets lack the same creative juices that others have. 

One culprit I’m starting to suspect is alcohol. I’d usually have 1-3 drinks during a set. I didn’t think it was an issue bc I never felt tipsy let alone drunk. However I realize the total drinks per week are adding up and am openminded to the cumulative effects that could have. Also an international touring dj friend, same age, said she cut back to 1 drink a week and it made a difference.

I also don’t stretch or exercise much other than walking a mile or so around the city per day. But after just finishing a busy week my knees, calves, and feet are pretty sore. My off days kinda feel like recovery days.

My thoughts are to cut off the drinking for a month, take yoga a couple times a week, and order some inserts for my shoes. Have you been in a similar boat, if so what worked for you? Thanks for your time!"
I’ve downloaded 3 mixtapes from Bandcamp in both mp3 and WAV form and every time I try to move it from my PC over to my USB it says there’s an issue and it’s corrupted. Same after I got a few mp3s from Spotify. This has never happened before is there anyway to fix it?
"I was inviting people to my party from a Facebook group. As it turned out, some of the group members were DJs and as I sent them my invitation, they replied that: ""Thank you, but I don't go to parties unless it's work and I am getting paid"". It was not a one time incident, and I saw a pattern emerging.

Well...
In my opinion it's quite sad when someone only go parties when he has to. Just imagine a porn-star who is at home with their partner: ""Sorry, I only have sex if I am working and getting paid"". Or a photographer who only opens his eyes to see the world when he works, otherwise he is wearing a blindfold.

Talking to these DJs was an instant turn off for me. I would not invite them to play at the events I organise if they have this burnt out attitude.

I am a DJ, and when I don't have a gig, then I am often going to parties or festivals where I even pay entrance, instead of getting paid. Am I the minority here?"
"For context, I am a beginner DJ and producer who plays a lot of upbeat house music. Mainly tech house and deep tech/underground stuff. Things that don’t have many vocals but a lot of groove and nice bass lines.

Been booked in for this gig for over a month however 1 day ago the organisers told me a new DJ will be starting and therefore has told me I’ll be having a b2b set.

The guy I’ll be going back to back with is a friend of mine, but his genre is super melodic, happy, slow house tunes that you’d expect at a Martin Garrix show. Not ideal. 

I told them to change it but they say nothing can really be done. I had the closing slot (2nd best slot) and prepared a great hour long set with my music. However now being told I’ll be going b2b with him, I’m worried about how the energy flow will go. Obviously I can’t play 3 deep tech house bangers for him to turn to 3 festival like David Guetta tracks. It’ll just sound awkward. 

I told him to dig out some beats, and that he can use some from my USB, but I’m just annoyed really that the full 1 hour has been taken from me. I guess things like this happen, but as a semi-beginner DJ I really wanted the full slot to showcase my skills. I don’t want people in the crowd discrediting the set because the flow of the music is weird.

What’s your guys opinions on this?"

"I recently picked up a used Rane 62. Most of the functionality is still good,  however,  when I play it longer than 2 hours it starts to make this static noise that sounds like an old TV with the rotary knobs.

My question is,  can this be fixed,  or is this a standard problem with old mixers? Thank you for your responses in advance."
"It finally happened, got a drink spilled on my controller 😫. Everything is fine except my right tempo slider is out of wack, I used f5 fader cleaner and it didn’t do anything.

"I have a gig this Sunday and will be using one Alto ts415 as my main speaker. It’s a powered speaker so I’m going to plug my DDJ 800 and mic into the two inputs the speaker has.

✅ I also connected my phone to the channel with a 3.5mm to 1/4 inch TRS and it sounded great!
❌ connecting the DDJ SB2 with a RCA to 1/4 inch TRS does not sound great. From what I’ve gathered it could be that the RCA is a stereo signal going into the singular TRS. ASK:Any thoughts on what could be the issue?

* Gather all the prepared tracks in 1 place, which has a music player that works well across devices (also mobile), so you always have access to listen to your songs.

"Hi everyone, I'm currently doing a library purge. I have about 3k songs that I collected over the past 2 years, but as my style is evolving and me not being picky when downloading songs I decided it was time to trim down.

This is how I'm tackling my problem: I go through all my songs in Finder on my Mac, then move songs I don't need anymore to a separate ""Archived"" folder. After that is finished, I want to remove all songs from my Rekordbox library and re-analyze the ones I kept. 

Also currently, I have separate folders in Finder for each genre. However, I want to change this to one big folder with all my music files and tag each song in Rekordbox as I make a lot of use of smart playlists. In the end, I want my Rekordbox to be organized and not the files on my computer, as the Rekordbox library is kind of the ""ground truth"".

What do you think of my approach? I think this should work for me, however, I want to create a good system/workflow that would make my life easier in the future, and I also want to avoid re-doing my library in the (near) future. How do you do it? Any tips and suggestions are welcome :)"

"For some reason, 1 out of every 15-20 songs that I load onto my USB seem to not load properly on CDJs. I've added a picture below. I can still press play on the song, and as it plays the small waveform on the bottom gets filled out. But the main one never shows up.

"I have used a Lenovo Yoga 510-14ISK with Rekordbox and Ableton for 5+ years and I need a new laptop. The battery is gone and the universe is telling me it's time to move on. 

I have recently got a job where I'll be DJ tutoring everyday and want something new. I'm trying to work out what is the cheapest laptop I can buy that will run Rekordbox smoothly (I use a DDJ-RX which doesn't take USB). My tracks are all on a hard drive so won't need loads of storage. 

My thought process behind getting one as cheap as possible is I want to have this laptop solely for this job. So in theory it just needs to be able to run Rekordbox and check work emails, maybe browse the web - that's it - other than that it'll be clean and unused. I'm never gonna use it to play out, as I'll use a USB stick in that case. And as for Ableton I'd like to buy a PC/ Mac and set up a proper studio.

This is really only going to make financial sense if I can get a laptop pretty cheap. Like couple of hundred quid if possible. I'm in the UK and saw these deals on Currys website:

https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-15.6-chromebook-intel-pentium-128-gb-emmc-blue-10251246.html

https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-ideapad-1-14-refurbished-laptop-intel-celeron-128-gb-ssd-blue-very-good-condition-10256799.html

I've seen people post in similar threads that i5 minimum is necessary, but my current laptop is i3 and has been fine running Rekordbox and Ableton and has mostly been fine. So I'm wondering if I can get away with something cheaper based on the above information.

If you've got this far thanks so much for reading and if you have any opinion on the matter would be interested to hear it."
"Hey guys,

I am a professional musician playing mainly solo for money, but also play in a few improv/jazz and rock bands. I play guitar, keys, drums, bass, and sing. I MC at a local open mic as well. I'm also decent with editing in DAWs like Ableton. I was just thinking about getting into DJing because I really like arangements and mashups, and it might be an easy way to make money with a skillset I might be further along in developing than I know. I also have a pretty good amount of sound equipment as it is.

I was just wondering how much crossover there is between these worlds! I don't really know where to start, but I think I'd be into DJing pop-funk/80s dance, classics, and some modern pop/rap - I feel like most DJs in my town have some odd taste, but tbh I'm pretty out of touch with what people my age like in terms of modern rap/hip-hop (I'm 24 and don't really like stereotypical modern pop rap lol).

Any insights are totally appreciated - thanks yall."
"I just moved up here from GA recently and FINALLY got a new laptop so I've been getting back into DJing again after about a year hiatus. Just wondering if there were any DJ's in town that I could come hang with/spin with (on a non-professional level). Just looking for cool, like-minded people in a new town. If this post isn't ok for this sub, Mods please delete. Thanks!"
"Every once in a while, we all get burnt out and need to take a break. But I'm in a situation where I'm studying during the week days and playing pretty much every Friday and Saturday in the weekends.

I have a feeling that I'm kinda burnt out at the moment. I don't get excited to play, I barely spend any time on finding new music above the bare minimum, my energy during gigs is through the floor, usual burnout stuff you know. I really want to take a break and don't even drink, network nor go to afters anymore.

The thing is, my gigs pay my rent and put food on my table, so taking a break isn't really an option for me in the next couple of months, because the job market here kinda sucks. When I get a chance, I'm definitely taking a break. Until then, is there something I can do to reignite my previous excitement and motivation to play? Try to focus on something or any advice for this? Because I feel my performance is taking a hit and I don't like that.

I know I'm incredibly lucky to be in my position and I'm in no way ungrateful or anything, but burnout kinda sucks

Edit: Thank you so much for the advice and comments. You guys are super helpful and I appreciate it as well as a few different perspectives. I'll reply in the morning!"
Do you ever play 2 or more different tracks from the same artist in one DJ set? Does anyone care if you do as long as they sound good?
i then woke up thinking why 6 tho lol

"First off I haven’t touched any Dj equipment in about 20 years. I thought it would be cool if my kids got into the hobby. So I got them a rev1 used for $150. I’m so confused by it. If you don’t press”play” at the exact right time, it feels impossible to speed it up or slow it down by dragging it or pushing it a little. It seems sooo off. We’ve had it for a month or so and I’ve used it about 7 times. I just simply hate it. Is there a different brand that may respond to
My dragging and nudging that is better than a rev1, without getting into “pro” gear"
Hi! I reformatted my Sandisk 1TB SSD and converted it to FAT32 and MBR partition and it still doesn't seem to work on CDJs. Is there any way it has worked for those who have the same? Or is there a recurring problem when it comes to the volume of the SSD. Thanks :) 
"I was offered to DJ for a media event that I was supposed to be a guest at, and I just have a gut feeling that it’s not going to end well.

2)Unknown if there is a controller/equipment at the venue

"So, a bit of context. I’ve been a bedroom DJ for almost two years now and I consider my DJing abilities to be quite good as of now as I practically master stuff like beatmatching, transitions, etc. I also have a music library that’s quite large (I ONLY play EDM, so mostly House, Trance, Techno, etc.). Up to this point I’ve only played for myself in my own bedroom as a hobby (always having a blast), and a few times on very small gatherings with friends (not so much to play entire sets for them, but mostly to show them my controller and my music), but I consider my abilities and music library to be good enough to play at a club or festival anytime without any issues, or so I thought until last night. 

The whole thing was a shitshow, let me explain. So yesterday was my friend’s birthday and she decided to throw a party at her lake house. She asked me if I could bring my stuff and play a set at her party, and I accepted (for free). I’ll admit that I didn’t prepare at all as I hadn’t practiced for days, hadn’t sorted my new songs, hadn’t even analyzed them on Rekordbox or set up hot cues (which I always do), etc. I was aware of all of this but I didn’t give it much importance as I had come up with killer sets on the fly in the past even with songs I had only listened to once, and people at raves are usually too drunk/high to even notice small mistakes. 

But there lies the problem, this was no rave, this was a house party. At most there were perhaps 12 to 15 people, AT MOST. Mostly distant ‘friends’ and acquaintances, people who’ve known me for years, and for most of them this was the first time they found out I’m a DJ. When I arrived the atmosphere was practically nonexistent, just a bunch of dudes and a few girls just sitting down, talking in small groups separated from each other or looking at their phones. I was even surprised and I thought I had arrived way too early, but turns out the party had already been going for like 3 hours. And the thing is, I know these people, and I know that they don’t listen to any EDM at all, so when I saw them while coming in I felt worried, but I didn’t make too much of it and said hi to everyone and had a few drinks and a few laughs. 

A couple hours later my friend asked me if I could start DJing and I said sure, thinking I might be able to maybe cheer everyone up. While setting up I started to feel a bit nervous (normal, it was my first gig after all), and as I started to DJ the people approached and some of them started dancing a bit but literally after like 2 or 3 songs most of them just walked away, I wondered if perhaps I started too strong as I opened with some light trance, but perhaps that was too much for them and I should’ve started with some generic house instead. Either way, I tried for a much funkier direction instead (nu disco, funky house) but none of them came back, there were only like 4 dudes left who weren’t even dancing, just staring at the visuals on the screen (I think they were high). And then there were this two drunk assholes who would constantly approach and start ""cheering for me"" but like in a derisive way while also mocking the way ravers dance and then they would leave laughing, or they would approach me and start playing with the jog wheel or twisting the knobs without my permission basically fucking up my beatmatch. 

I reached the breaking point when two dudes just straight up started harassing me. One of them would constantly approach me telling me that I had been playing ""techno"" (it was house, but whatever) for like 3 hours (it had been ONE hour tops) and demanding me to play Hip Hop instead. The other one would just stand by my side and start telling me that he ""wasn’t feeling it"" and that I should play better stuff, or he would just stare at the computer screen and ask ""how much longer?"" or say ""you’re taking too long"". Everyone looked so fucking bored and I felt so pressured because I felt that maybe they weren’t having a good time because of me, like maybe I was forcing my music down their throats or something. At this point there was basically no one sticking around so I just unplugged everything and left the fucking party. 

I was so fucking angry and I felt extremely humiliated and embarrassed, and the thing that enraged me the most is that the birthday girl and the other 3 people who were asking me ""when are you gonna start DJing?"" the entire party just walked away after like 10 fucking minutes, so why did I even bother? Especially the birthday girl, she made me feel like a dancing monkey, a circus freak, a novelty to show to all of her friends that she can just throw away when she gets bored of it. I then felt extremely sad because when I got home I opened the IG story of a friend who stayed at the party and it looked like everyone was having a blast. It was like as soon as I left the party, they were finally able to play their Hip Hop music and have fun. I have to say that not everything was all that bad, the few actual close friends of mine that were at that party were actually enjoying themselves and dancing and asking me with real curiosity stuff about DJing or the controller or the software. 

So my first gig was a nightmare, and I’m left wondering what should I do. One the one hand I LOVE DJing, it’s my favourite pastime and my way to decompress and relax after a long day. I’ve also considered having it as an actual job because I’m a producer and I think it would be a nice way to promote my music, and also because I love raves and because you can travel a lot with this job. On the other hand, I’m seriously questioning my abilities because maybe I’m not as good as I thought I was and maybe this job is just not for me, and also the thought of dealing with this bullshit every time (drunk assholes, song requesters, dead crowds) is just appalling, I’ve always known that these are a DJ’s worst enemies (almost cliche) but having finally interacted with these people and these situations in the flesh felt way worse that I thought it would tbh. Also, what worries me is that this is a small town and word could quickly spread that maybe I’m a shitty DJ which could impact my career prospects (I don’t even live here anymore anyways but who knows, what if word reaches the town I’m currently living in?). Ugh, I don’t know what to make of all of this.

I’m sorry for this long ass rant, but I felt that if I didn’t get all of that out my head would explode. So what do you think guys? What should I do? Maybe next time I should prepare better and stick to a theme? I think I’ve learned my lesson to NEVER DJ at a house party ever again unless its packed and I’m sure the assistants enjoy EDM.

Edit: Just to clarify some things for some people in the comments, I acknowledge I fucked up by not preparing beforehand, that was my mistake and I learned the lesson. To be fair though, the host knew I exclusively play edm (for the moment) and she said it was alright, that the guests would like that music, and I took her word for it. Also one of the reasons this didn’t work out is because the party was supposed to have more than 100 guests, and I guess she was expecting it to be like Project X or something, of course it didn’t go as planned. I’m not saying the audience was wrong and dumb and I was right and smart, they were right to be bored, it’s just that I didn’t have a good time during my first live performance, that’s all. Also, I’m a girl, not a guy :)"
"Hola,

So I am moving to Spain very soon for a while. I will be living in a 20 millon euro villa. My goal is to have a like a studio that faces the sea and pool to produce and also pratice/preparing sets.  

Since the place is so big I also would like to do private events for friends on the rooftop terrace. 

So any reccomendations for what two different options of speaker that could  be?

I really like ADAM for production - are  they good for a living room party djing also you think?

Another thing about rooftop speakers is that they need to be easy to carry down all the stairs and be possible to use at beach parties or smaller inndor venues. 

Thanks for any input guys!

"Im on the hunt for some speaker for my home setup that will be an ""all around"" speaker but unsure of what direction to go towards. 

I'm Dj'ing right now but will eventually start to produce as well in the future, should I go for flat studio monitors like Yamahas or monitors like the Pioneer DM40, M-Audio BX4 or KRKs?

I live in an NYC apartment so I can't go too loud, just want something with accurate sound that won't break the bank. Something I can listen to tracks on beatport, play some sets and eventually work on some tracks. "
"Hey family, so I’m looking to record a set on my rooftop at my apartment complex, however, there is no power source. What is y’all’s favorite go-to setup when this is the case? Is a generator the only option??"

"Hallo liebe Gemeinschaft,

ich wollte mich mal erkundigen, ob es DJs gibt, die mit ihrer Tätigkeit Geld verdienen und gleichzeitig über eine Agentur vermittelt werden. Da ich von Agenturen bislang keine Rückmeldung bekam, wollte ich es mal hier versuchen. 

Mein Frage bezieht sich auf die Struktur der Zusammenarbeit zwischen DJ und Agentur: Stelle ich mir das so vor, dass es Leute gibt, die sich als Freiberufler - falls man es durchbekommen hat - gemeldet, ein Kleingewerbe angemeldet oder welche Rechtsform, die einem passend erscheint, gemeldet haben und dann nur über die Agentur(en) vermittelt werden und dieser dann einen prozentualen Abschlag zahlen? Lässt man sich über die Agentur vermitten und vermittelt sich zusätzlich in Eigenleistung? Oder ist man bei einer Agentur wie in einem Angestelltenverhältnis und muss sich dann um nichts mehr kümmern? Gibt es Erfahrungen für Abwägungen?

Ich hoffe, ich konnte meine Frage verständlich darstellen und bin für jede Rückmeldung dankbar :)

Hello dear community,

i wanted to ask about DJs that are earning money with their work and are simultaneously placed with an agency. I didn't receive responses from some angencies to date so i though i could try to find an answer here.

My question is about the cooperation between agency and DJ: Is it organised as if you registered your business - as a type of legal form that suits your expectations - and then are ""distributed"" by the agency / agencies exclusively and they keep a payment in advance? Or do you get ""distributed"" by the agency / agencies and simultaneously look for gigs by yourself? Or is it like a regulary employment at a company so that you don't have to worry about anything furthermore? Do you have any experiences for consideration?

I hope i could make you understand my issue and i'm thankful for every response :)"
"Hey! I'm looking for a record pool that has latin tracks but due to me using these edits for mobile events, they must be clean! I've checked out dj city, Club killers, and bpm Latino. Any other pools I forgot about?"
"Hi, I just got back into djing after a break of 15 years. I’m all analogue, and picked up a Rane TTM 57 SL to play with. Everything works perfectly on it, but the cue slider seems to make no difference. It always outputs both PGM 1 &amp; 2 equally, and it’s kind of annoying when trying to cue up / find the next track on a record. 

I wondered if there’s a setting on Serato (that I can no longer gain access to) that might be overriding the cue slider?

I have never used serato and can’t now with this mixer, but i feel like I must be missing something obvious that is overriding the cue slider? (I’ve checked the ‘master cue’ is off. It still works and plays only the master output when selected)

Any ideas appreciated, thanks"
"So, sometimes, at home, I'm just doing a quick demo in a certain genre, for a specific venue or event. Or I'm just trying out a stack of new downloads or testing out some changes to my livestream setup - those mixes always turn out to be the most fun to play and, when I listen back the next day, the recordings are always my favorites - really fun to make and always super fun to listen to. I'm talking like 30 minutes where I'm just winging it, ripping through ten or more tracks in record time, not worried about letting them play out *at all*. Just mixing in the next one as soon as it feels even reasonably decent to do so (which is sometimes only like 30 seconds). Each track gets an absolute max of 3 minutes, including mix-in/out time, usually less. This applies to Deep House, Tech House, EBM, Disco, Bass, Glitch, Club/Party tracks, Jazzy Trip-Hop, Downtempo, Lounge, whatever, by the way.

I've never played a live set this way, I feel like I'm always out there kinda milking it for time, letting tracks play out, long-form (and sometimes feeling, and probably looking, a little bored), which is stupid because I always have 4+ hours of tracks I want to play for a 2-hour set and have to pick a short list. I guess, obviously, I should try ripping through more tracks, quicker and solve both problems at the same time.

As far as my experience can tell, it just feels totally fresh and funky and fun the entire time, both to perform and to listen back.

Does anybody else play this way, feel this way? I mean, *I know people do this*, just curious if anyone has a point of view or some experience to share or something.

Edit: Also, usually the really good ones come when my mindset is ""this is a throw-away"" recording that I have NO intention of sharing/posting. And then, for some reason, it's the best one I've done in weeks.

My Pioneer Dj DDj-Rev1 makes rustles regardless of whether I use the cinch output or the headphone output. Laptop or PC I have strong rustle at a certain point in all configurations. The only thing where there is only a slight rustle is when I tell the program to play everything via PC/laptop speakers/headphones then the noise is only minimal. What could be the problem? Did sombody has any idee what i can try ? Please excuse my english its not my first language 😅

&amp;#x200B;

I've already purchased and returned the new model Technics EAH-DJ1210 cause even if the construction and the detatchable cable are fine, the sound is very poor compared to the previous model...they sound too bassy and muffled in my opinion.

On second-hand sales sites they are almost impossible to find or are in very poor conditions...

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. I've tried and owned so many headphones from the HD 25s, some Pioneers, Urbanears Zinken, aiaiai tma-1 and tma-2...but even if they aren't the best overall, the Technics ones have that punchy and front-facing sound perfect for beatmatching that I haven't found in any other headphones."

"Finally, after great feedback from this Reddit, research on my own and watching YouTube videos, these are the options I am trying to decide on. I would really appreciate it if you can help me decide, I understand at the end is my decision but don't know who else to ask.

1. **Option 1: 2x RCF ART 910 + RCF SUB 702 or 705**
2. **Option 2: 2x RCF ART 912 (No sub for now)**
3. **Option 3: 2x RCF ART 932 (No sub for now)**

Yes, this is for the bedroom DJ (House) and occasional Small/Medium Bar-Patios. I don't want Studio monitors for the house.

I’ve never used the app before, and don’t have the ability to mess around and test it before my set.

Does the app record dual-channel audio when recording with the mic as well? Or will it merge the mixer audio and mic audio into the one file?

I’m looking to get new DJ gear. I do plan on playing at clubs that have cdjs 3000s. I can get an Opus Quad. But I see a deal now for the Denon SC6000m that comes with a free LC6000. If I get that with a 1850 mixer I would save $800. I know the Opus can do 4 channel stand alone. A lot of the clubs in my city only have 2 cdjs. I do like the idea of separate units over all in one units. At first I wanted to stay in rekordbox. But wouldn’t mind using Denon gear at home and cdjs in the club since I discovered the Denon deal. Or am I better suited with the Opus if I plan playing at clubs? I don’t want the XZ since the screen is small for my eyes.

"Does anyone have experience with the Reloop Flux interface using Traktor Pro 3 and Traktor Scratch Control Vinyls?

I've ordered the Reloop Flux (still waiting for it) and was thinking of using Serato, but I realize that mapping the X1 MK3 in Serato isn't as easy as I'd hoped. Mainly because I can't map the X1 to a virtual 4-band EQ without paying for Reloop's $10/month expansion, and because the X1 MK3 still doesn't seem to be supported in Native Instruments' Controller Editor.

So I'm thinking of going back to Traktor because it'd be easier for using the X1 and managing the digital part of my setup, but is Reloop Flux still a good buy in this case? Do I lose any of Reloop Flux's features by using it in Traktor in DVS?"

It was working fine for most of the night, when all of a sudden, tracks on one deck started going into emergency loop. I could still browse the menu and attempt to browse tracks. However, when loading tracks, they would initially play for a second or two, then the audio would cut and it would flash an E-8302 error. I could still play tracks from both usbs on the other XDJ, only the left one was busted. Restarting the left CDJ fixed the issue.

"For other DJs out there using the iTunes/Apple Music to organize their library - what do you find is the best way to prepare crates for gigging?

I like the advantage of iTunes to ID3 tag, preview, shuffle and enjoy music without having to open up DJ software - so my thought process was that it's easier to organize a substantial library in there. And then while I'm flowing around, construct a set in iTunes itself in a playlist - and then sync the playlist with the Rekordbox/iTunes sync.

Recently I've been thinking more and more about doing this the other way around - just using iTunes as an aggregate for ID3 tagging + music listening, but actual set preparation and organizing things for gigging in Rekordbox. Is there a difference? Does it really matter? Appreciate any opinions."

"I'm primarily a wedding DJ and in the past, I've just had clients email me timeline info, playlists, etc. and I would get all the details I needed from them when I called them, but I'm trying to streamline that by having some sort of savable form I can send them that has fields for event-related songs and processional notes, boxes to tick for genres of music they would like to hear, etc.

The big thing here would also be to have this whole form be savable, rather than submission based, so my clients could work on it at their leisure, rather than having to input the whole thing at once.

A free option would be great, but I don't mind paying a little money for something either. Google Forms seems to be the closest to what I'm looking for that I've seen, but I believe it only saves their answers for up to 30 days; I need something more permanent than that.

Thanks!"

"Am I missing something here? The entire manual is spread out all over the site. There is no PDF available. It almost seems intentionally misleading too because to get to the manual, you go to the ""Downloads"" tab on the main page, but that just spits you back out to the sprawling [HTML manual](https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/categories/202698038-Serato-DJ-Pro-manual). There are 6 pages just on [cue points](https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/sections/205186387-Cue-Points), 10 on the [setup screen](https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/sections/205168587-Setup-Screen), and 6 pages under [activation](https://support.serato.com/hc/en-us/sections/204162908-Activation)...

I know these companies love driving traffic to their websites, but this seems excessive. Like ""sure, you can buy the software, but you have to come crawling back to us every time you need to reference some functionality that you haven't used or are a bit murky on.""

"Hello everyone, I was considering purchasing a SC live 2 and putting an external battery on it to make it totally portable since I have seen videos that do it but I would not know what battery and adapter to buy The other option is the Numark Pro Go but it doesn't give me confidence in the quality of the sound materials, since it is the lowest range from Denon, it has fewer effects... but it is completely autonomous. Is it worth that economic difference between the two? I ruled out the prime go because I can't put bluetooth speakers on it but it was the best quality option thank you so much"
"Good evening fellow DJs. I’m looking for your advice.

I’m an italian Dj with almost 15 years of experience and more than a few gigs under my belt, but I’ve never had to deal with something like this: a cultural non-profit organization recruited me in order to host a 10 lessons DJ workshop for teens starting at the end of this month.

We are expecting 5-10 teenagers to sign up for the course, ranging from 14 to 17 years old, without any DJing experience.

I've already started sketching down a basic course program for the 10 planned lessons, including vinyl vs digital mixing, a sprinkle of DJing history, the differences between mixing styles, and so on, but the thing I'm having trouble with is deciding what hardware the kids will be practicing on. 

I own a Pioneer RX2, which I'm planning to use as my theory-practice explanation device, using a projector in order to let all the class see what I'm doing. I am not entirely convinced about letting the students use my device, as there is a risk of damage, and the students would have to take turns practicing one at a time, leaving the rest of the class bored to death.

The best solution, in my opinion, would be getting a few all-in-ones the student can share in pairs, trying to stay on the budget side. Also, I'd love them to be standalone devices, without requiring computers/tablets/phones to control.

Is there any particular hardware model you can suggest me?
How many students should I group up for each device, taking turns practicing?

Thank you colleagues, you are the best.

EDIT: Some info I mistakingly left out: the non-profit organisation will be budgeting the event, hence I'm not on a specific budget but ""the cheaper the better"", you know..
The workshop will be free for the kids.
My go to choice would be using mixing hardware: I understand all the advantages of apps and mobile softwares, and by the way it may actually end up as my choice, but I think learning to beatmatch by ear is way more solid as a fundamental than beatmatching by looking at waveforms. 
Or, maybe, I'm just biased by the way I learnt the profession when I was just starting up."
"I'm a college student, and I plan to utilize equipment rental offered for free at my school in order to get a video camera and possibly a microphone, to the end of recording my own sets.

I am wondering, though, how to go about this intelligently. I don't have much experience recording video or syncing sound to video, etc. I am also unsure about storage requirements. Will I need to invest in some external storage? Will I need editing software? If so, which? Should I record the sound live from a mic or is there a better alternative?

I would greatly appreciate answers that can help me out. For reference, I don't expect I'll be recording more than 2 hours. Additionally, I use a \*ahem\* AlphaTheta XDJ-RR to mix.

"So I’ve been harsh on VR DJing in the past.

I still am not sold on VR _only_ DJing as a replacement to IRL partying, but I just saw this stupid TikTok using the Apple Vision Pro and the penny dropped for me. 

VR DJing will always be a niche thing, but AR in DJing is likely be huge someday. 

One of my biggest (and perhaps only) dislikes of digital DJing with laptop and controllers today is the song selection interface. 

Simply put, scrolling a list of words comes nowhere close to the physical, spatial, visual and tactile benefits of flipping through a record bag to find your next track. 

The combination of putting records that go well together next to each other (spatial), having an emotional or intuitive memory of a track triggered by the album colour or art (visual), and physical / tactile selection of 12”’s cannot be beat when it comes to song selection. 

I’ve imagined physical ways of reproducing this in the past through some kind of rotating midi drum and screen combo (cc u/rutierut) but nothing really stuck. 

Now.. watch that video and imagine having a physical record box full of blank cardboard 12” sleeves, with QR codes or fiducial markers on them. Instead of seeing code, you have a Vision Pro or cheaper, next gen equivalent headset on which  displays album art on it. And instead of taking the record out of the sleeve, you just select it and it cues up in your digital player of choice. 

Infinite access to your digital crates, all the benefits of 12” record sleeves and organisation, but none of the downsides of lugging actual vinyl. 

I never saw an immediate use case for VR in DJing, but I would absolutely pay for something like this. 

Virtual controllers and mixers are still useless in my opinion, but a hybrid AR/physical library browser and an IRL mixer set up would be an absolute delight for me."
"Bucket list dream has always been a pair of Technics 1200.  Always thought scratching sounded nice and looked dope and thought it would be fun to mess around with.   


***\*****knock on wood****\****   I'm 99.9999% close to copping a pair of Technic 1200's for a song and a dance.. too good to be true so we shall see.  Seller jus offered me his mixer, used but very well taken care of, a Rane TTM 56 w/case for $300.   


At first I thought way overprice but as jus spent an hour researching it, apparently RANE is top shelf on this stuff and these are built real well, like tanks. Avg price on ebay seems to be $250 based on last 15 sold..  


So what do yall think?    Or what other mixer do you recommend for a pair of Technic 1200's for an aspiring scratcher?   


**p.s.**  (per my google skills) Is the Pioneer DDJ-REV1 the best dj controller for an entry-level aspiring scratch head?"
I currently use two QSC KW181 subs with my setups. I’ve been considering getting a pair of 15” subs to use for smaller venues.

Thank you for your input.
"Hey y’all. Not sure if which sub to write this in but felt this was the more fitting one. 

Anyway, wanted your thought on any of you guys that produce too - do you make music that’s different from what you DJ (e.g produce rap / DJ house, produce house / DJ rap etc.) and do you think this affects the type of venues / gigs you play at or for?

"We all know the flac DJs get sometimes. You will be playing and a non DJ club owner doesn't like the music and makes you stop.

"Just a general question.. I did a set a week ago and I realized how different my style of DJing was with a couple of mates I played b2b with. They loop a lot! Even at times where I think it'd be unnecessary if I was making the transition. The whole set sounded good and cohesive though, I guess it goes to show how different everyone's ways are.

Do you tend to loop every track/transition or do you not bother?

"I'm sure someone may have already gone through this so I thought I'd ask here.

I'm trying to run my own events and build up a fan base. Now I'm a co admin of an fb with 60K followers, 18% of those people are in my city, so that's about 11 thousand people right there. It's a Nostalgia FB page and thought I might celebrate the amount of followers by throwing a party. So I hired a boat weeks ago and now there's a few days left and I've sold maybe 40 out of the 150 tickets I was supposed to. They say most people would buy tickets at the last minute but I'm obviously worried so now I'm trying to figure out what I can do to get a last minute boost in tickets. I don't care about the money even, so long as I can just pull a decent crowd.

The whole with promoting is most of the people you'd bring are closely related to you or people you've already interacted with, but I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to convert people and if there's any way I can push tickets without that.

What I really want is that turning point where I start getting more notice as a DJ and my mean starts meaning more but that comes with time, getting a break or some kind of opportunity that takes me to the next level where followers start building up. That's the stage I can't fully get to at the moment.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and made it work?
What should I be doing over the last few days until the event to get maybe another 80 tickets moved?"
"I tend to watch YouTube reviews of certain controllers to hear their honest opinion on everything that drops and for the most part, reviewers are pretty good on that. Except for some reason when the Omnis-Duo dropped all and I do mean all reviewer's sang this controllers praise. The only negative thing I saw was the price is a bit high, but other than that it's a great controller.

Here is my issue, both Denon Prime Go and MixStream pro are both stand alone units with far more features and the reviewers gave their honest opinions. They said what they liked and disliked, but with the Omnis-Duo nothing but praise. 

I get reviewers don't want to lose their connection with AlphaTheta but how are we to trust your reviews if you don't care to push the industry standard forward."

"I'm thinking of working on an idea to help DJs make the most of visual resources (primarily screens) with generative AI. With a background in DJing and Machine Learning, I'm hoping to help DJs put on fantastic visual shows in addition to musical ones.

Still working on the exact mechanics, but the general idea would be to give the AI access to your music libraries and let it learn what you like to play (possibly even what you've played in past sets) in addition to several inputs (e.g. moods, location, etc.) and it would output graphics in the form of GIFs and short videos you can control with a small touch screen. The idea would be to produce cheap, high-quality videos you can use. The dream is to have every DJ make visuals comparable to those of Madeon or Tale of Us!

Would love to hear any feedback, thoughts, concerns, etc. Is this a terrible idea? Would love to know before I spend significant time building it.

"Hi all

Throwaway account.

I think I need a bit of a reality check to see if i’m justified at being mad at my local clubs or if i’m being ridiculous.

For context:
Club A (biggest club in my city) i’ve been speaking with since October. The manager there originally said they would get me on within two weeks, but they never open my messages on insta. Every time i go into the club to speak to the manager they act all friendly and just say it’s been busy but they’ll get me a gig within the month. Obviously this hasn’t happened and I feel like i’m just being strung along.

Club B recently opened within the past few months. I’ve been emailing them and they were pretty keen to get me in to play and i’ve even played there once. They originally said my music was too fast for them (they were playing house and I played techno) and asked if i could change up the vibe. I agreed and sent them a house mix. They then stopped replying and i’ve heard nothing even after multiple follow-ups. This week I see that they’re now playing techno which has annoyed me a little after asking me to change and then ghosting me.

Also, just for more context, i have a small following and DJ regularly at Club C (2nd biggest club in my city) usually as headlining/closing act might I add.

Would love someone else’s thoughts on this situation."
"Hi everyone,

I'm currently using a XDJ RX standalone controller + a turntable that I connect to the XDJ in phono (I switch between deck and phono depending on whether I'm transitioning to a digital track or vinyl)

2 problems:

\- I'd like to mix with 4 channels (xdj rx only has 2 channels)

\- I'd like to have a more club-oriented workflow and therefore practice on CDJ

Ive found a pair of CDJ 900 nexus in my city, in superb condition (almost new) sold for 1500 euros. To that I'll add a Xone 43c mixer for €500. Im pretty sure i can sell the XDJ RX1 + the magma flight case for around 1100€.

I wanted to know if you think its interesting to switch from XDJ RX1 to CDJ 900 nexus + xone 43c set up.

Also, what do you think of these CDJs (apart from the fact that they have no hot cues) and in general, do you think the money invested is worth it? (1500 + 500 - 1100 = 900€ cost for the transition)

"Hi everyone! I hope you're all doing fine.

I recently bought the Numark M6 USB mixer for my studio to replace my old and used DJM 800.
I was aware, that the M6 doesn't have any FX Unit, but as I love to use FXs, I'm trying to figure out a solution/workaround.

I'm using the Traktor DJ software and connect my computer with the mixer through the Traktor A6 Scratch device.
On this interface, you have a specific output channel, which you can use for FX Send. (There's an official documentation about it)

The idea would be to connect this channel with one of the 4 main Line In of the mixer, through a RCA cable.
Therefore, is it possible to use one of the 4 main channels on the M6 to receive the FX signal, and use it so?
And can I use it without to setup any FX Return? (as it's no use for me)
Or do you know any other way around?

I hope everything in my message is clear enough...otherwise tell me :)"

"I have been an independent DJ for about seven years now.  I keep getting recommended by friends, or someone I know reaches out directly.  It's fun, but certainly more of a ""Every once in a while side gig"" for me that brings in some side cash.

Today I'm coming here looking for advice on how much to charge for a gig.  I'm in northern Minnesota, and this gig was in a local rural town.  I gave about 10-11 hours total of my time for the gig between prep, setup/breakdown, and the event itself.  I ran music for a few hours, did some emceeing, and also co-hosted a live auction and raffles.  I didn't end up doing all of the emceeing, because one of the presenters wanted someone else to introduce him, so we tag teamed it.

My time is valuable.  I realize that more as I get older (I'm 26), but at the same time, I don't want to overcharge for something that didn't end up completely being my gig in the end even though I provided the equipment and curated the music.

For an emcee gig with music like this, how much do you charge?  Per hour, or flat rate?  Does ending up with a co-emcee who's not connected to you and your service change things for you at all?  These answers that end up on this post will help shape what I charge going forward, so thank you for your time!"

"Hi guys, I'm not sure to buy an 850 kit (CDJ's 850 and DJM850 mixer). 

Mainly to record sets at home and rent them to events and nightclubs in the region. I'm from Minas Gerais - Brazil. 

A kit like this is going for 11.699$ BRL here (this is the value of used equipment), it is complicated to find this new equipment here.

 I wanted to get the DJM-750MK2 mixer but the value is 15.000$ BRL just for the mixer, what do you think? What's more worthwhile?

I also wanted to use the pair of CDJ850 with the DJM-450 mixer but I think the visual is a bit rough, even for renting the set is ugly, two large CDJ's with a small mixer in the middle, it looks weird. 

But which would be better kit 850 or DJM450+CDJ850? Thanks"
So I’ll occasionally buy and flip storage units at auction and this is from one that I’m considering buying. Have figured out that it’s an Odyssey case and it’s DJ equipment but I do t know anything about this stuff. I’ve seen that there’s a pretty big range from these odyssey cases. Anyone have a rough idea by the size what this is or what the resale value could be?
"Really hoping someone can help me out here, my setup is a bit odd but I hope someone out there can give me some guide on how to get this controller working with Rekordbox.

&amp;#x200B;

I've downloaded the driver and connected everything as per the video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azFLam8IFwg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azFLam8IFwg)) but when I load a track into a channel in rekordbox mode the controller seems unresponsive. 

&amp;#x200B;

To note, I'm using external speakers that are plugged in via an audio interface so I'm hoping to keep this setup as I'll want to also use the same setup for production. I'm also using voicemeeter banana to capture and split sources for other use cases. "
"I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit for this and I’m sorry if that’s the case. I got my molded earplugs done a few months ago. I’ve been using them since then, since they did the job fine (I guess?). But when I went to the last party I realized that when I’m holding them with my fingers, they make a perfect seal, but after letting them go, it feels like they fall out a little bit, just enough to let some bass through. My question is, is this how it should be or do my earplugs not fit correctly? Can I bring them back and get new ones made for free if thats the case?"
"I originally bought the alto ts415 powered PA speaker and upon testing it I noticed a small hiss from the horn once powered on and then a couple seconds later it got a little bit louder. It’s as if once the Bluetooth fully initializes it gets louder so I think it’s coming from the module but this is the second speaker brand new that is happening on. I then had the speaker replaced and the same thing as happening. Anyone have any experience with this or understand why this might be happening? My thoughts are that it might be bad Bluetooth implementation.

I’ve tried a couple search protectors in a couple different outlets in my house and I have also tried plugging the speaker directly into different outlets in my house but I haven’t taken the speaker to a different house in order to rule out a possible dirty ground in my home. However, I have a few other monitor speakers that don’t do this."
Hello DJ community. I recently bought a cool Vestax PMC-09A off of ebay in good condition and have started to use it in the past week. However I am not super excited and was expecting better sound quality with the equipment I have. I'm running it into a Soundcraftsman A5002 amplifier and EV SH15-2 speakers. We are streaming audio and I have also played a few songs off of CD's but the system just does not seem to put out the sound I expected with either one. We are using it in a really large venue (the roller skating rink where I volunteer) Does anyone have an opinion on the Vestax preamp on sound quality? I may take in my Soundcraftsmen preamp and play a few songs without using the Vestax and see if there is much difference. I am new to the dj thing and appreciate everyone's thoughts. Thanks.
I’ve been booked a few months out to perform at a silent disco.  My questions are:  How do you handle the monitor situation?  Are headphones setup to allow for cueing up the next track?  Any advice in advance is appreciated!
"I have an elaborate system of smart playlists creating folders and playlists for all my normal tracks in Traktor.

"Hey guys!

"How often do you guys rent DJ equipment? I bought a storage locker a few months ago and I got a bunch of DJ equipment. I posted it on marketplace and OfferUp but a few of my DJ friends told me to rent them. I have no idea how much they go for or if people even rent these . As a former DJ I had all my own equipments and never rent. Just wanted to know if that’s a common thing with DJs now. Oh and it’s mostly the newer active qsc and Ev top/sub. 

Update : Thank you my fellow djs and anyone who offered their advice . That’s why I love Reddit , if you’re second guessing something you can come on here and get answers directly from the horses mouth. I decided I’m going to rent these since they are the newer speakers and will go legit with a LLC , contracts etc I will also offer delivery service for an extra $ and I will add more high end equipment to my collection if it goes well. I will turn down the offer I got from marketplace and remove the ad.

"Hi all! Quick bit of background before getting into the question. I started DJing in 1999 and quit in 2008. Most of my gigs during that time were at afterparties, fetish parties and the occasional club appearance.

After a 15 year break, I decided to start up again at the ripe old age of 50, because I love the music and missed being creative, but I'm happy with just posting my mixes on my Soundcloud page. I really don't care about playing live anymore as I would rather work on my DJ and production skills (which I also started a year ago), than trying to hustle and promote myself in order to get gigs in the small city I moved to in 2022. I also find that this has freed me from dancefloor centric music. I've been branching out into ambient, downtempo and electronica which I would imagine isn't super marketable , especially in my neck of Upstate NY.

Just wondering if there are any other DJs out there who don't care about performing in front of a crowd.  


edit: Another reason I'm not into the whole club thing is that I have mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears above 2k Hz and I would like to preserve what hearing I have left."
Played the same song twice in the set….🤦‍♂️kinda no excuse and it was great otherwise!! Oh well I guess
"I'm doing my first rounds of international travel as a DJ (American here), and I really screwed up my travel plans on the leg of the trip taking me between Tokyo -&gt; Saigon. I neglected to ensure that my visa was taken care of, and I got pushed back 24 hours while I waited to get approved. Good thing I was trying to get to the city a day before my booking, but after paying to get an express visa, immigration document costs, paying to change my flight, losing my travel expenses to and from the airport the first time, I'm pretty in the red on accepting this gig. Not to mention I neglected to bring a secondary backpack, so when the bag I intended to carry on was overweight I had to check the whole thing, including my laptop and USBs. I'm spending this whole flight praying everything arrives safely and I don't wind up with busted essential equipment, not to mention the wasted time I am staring out the window at the ocean instead of working on my set or my productions in Ableton.

Does anyone have an international DJ checklist that can help prevent bungles like this going forward? I feel like I could really use the advice going forward so I don't wind up caught with my pants down again!"
"Hello, I'm just a producer, and I make quite a few productions, but also quite a few bootlegs.

My specific question is how to promote or move these edits with DJs (from my town or country, not necessarily famous DJs) and how to approach them? In any case, how to offer them to play my productions in their sets (obviously this depends on whether it fits into their set) I understand that all of this must be a win-win.

Greetings."
"Fellow DJs and gear enthusiasts.

I bought a (new) Pioneer DJM-450 mixer around christmas. Now, the left sound color fx channel/knob is behaving weirdly:

Moving the knob just slightly (like 5%) renders a full effect of the FX (100%). Moving it a bit further, it kind of ”jumps back” to it’s normal level. 

This creates a ”hole” in the sound when using the left fx, and sounds fucked up in mixtapes. 

Any suggestions?"
Does anyone know which lasers work well with rekordbox? Preferably something I could easily buy.
"Have long appreciated the unique sheen added to a lot of the sets played at Burning Man, and for a while djs were tagging their sets as ""playatech"" as the genre--but I've struggled to find a good font of labels or sources to discover similar music, short of mining various Burning Man sets for individual tracks.

Not talking about the woodblocky deep house / guru house / atmospheric / hippie stuff you can find anywhere (e.g. Anjunadeep, All Day I Dream, Kindisch); more of the edgier, like... imagine a ""deep desert psy house"" sound, low 120's BPM, with strong currents of syncopated percussive melodies. Have scoured ""melodic house &amp; techno"" tracks all over Beatport, ZipDJ, Bandcamp and Soundcloud to no avail, even though intuitively that seems like the right place to dig. 

Anyone picking up what I'm putting down here? Would love some label or keyword suggestions to aid in this quest."
"Anyone got DVS or Phase to work with this set up?  The TTs work fine as a standalone via phono out but doesnt function with DVS or Phase. Any idea?

"I was just joking with a friend about how it was basically essential to know how to mix in headphones when we were doing stuff on the regular, because no one would ever have the sense to provide a monitor speaker. I'm just wondering how universal this issue is? I also had a show once where the only ask on my list was a decent mixer because mine at the time was acting up, I provided literally every other piece of equipment. Not only was there no mixer there on arrival, the promoter didn't bother showing up either. "
"Hi all,

My father used to be a DJ in his 20s, and a few years ago he bought some old Pioneer CDJ 200s (I believe). 

However the old collection of cds he had have since burnt out and he is not too technically savy to replace them.

His birthday is coming up and I would like to get a sentimental gift and replace his cd collection as a surprise.

Where do I source songs and samples, and what is the proper approach to organising the music into cds? I.e. based on style,bpm or length. How many tracks per cd?

I would also like to get him a new set of headphones preferably a £100 or under.

All and any suggestions are appreciated 😊"
Going to buy either the concorde scratch or digital but what would u suggest would be the best for scratching on DVS?
"I am on an epic crate digging crusade at the moment, and rediscovering a truckload of records that time forgot. So many dodgy cuts, copy n paste remixes and bootlegs, good filler tracks, bad filler tracks etc.

What do you do with those tracks that never make it to banger or iconic status? Do you keep them or toss them out?

Fillers do have a purpose. Many of them copy a sound that works and just rearrange the melodies etc. They allow us to split the bangers and hits up and time their release. Many fillers are solid tracks, they just dont stand out from the crowd or scream 'keep me'. "
"A born and bred Chinese girl, just turned 23, went through middle school high school bachelor and Master, finally got a 90k job working as Product designer. Occasionally a raver ofc.

"I've been producing my own electronic music since I was about 16. 38 now. I have a ton of tracks. I have never done anything with them except share with a few friends. How can I ""sell"" them?

I’ve got two sl1200s and control vinyls but my rane box is out of support. I’m looking to upgrade my mixer so I can mix mp3s or vinyl. Any guidance is appreciated!
"I said what I said lol

The price is ridiculous for what it does. They copied what Denon GO did three years ago but slapped their label on it and made it way more expensive. The only benefits are portability, ease of setting up, and “aesthetic.” The controls look terrible, sliders are so small, and it’s missing some key features for professional performance. The battery only lasts 5 hours. It’s not truly “wireless” you have to RCA into a chunky AlphaTheta receiver (which they list nothing about in the website, I literally can’t tell anywhere if it’s included with the product)  The USB input on the back hurts my soul, and don’t get me started on the “Bluetooth audio input enables the crowd to join” lmao 

The problem is, no one taking DJing seriously would invest in this. This is not for clubs, promoters, or anyone in industry. And no one casually DJing would pay that much for a toy like this… unless they had disposable income. Nobody asked for this. If they wanted the rebrand to be taken seriously, they should’ve come out with a more serious product. 

You’re gonna see content creators doing short form videos playing Losing It at the Eiffel Tower or Badadan in a fucking bodega on this thing. 

And don’t get me started on the speaker -_-

Anyway feel free to join my hate train lol, or even offer up some counter opinions. I’m interested and concerned to see what happens to this brand."

"Looking at picking up a new rotary or fader mixer. Wondering how the new elara.4 compares to Mastersounds/Condesa/ARS/Varia/E&amp;S/A&amp;H Xone 96 in terms of sound quality. Obviously the Mastersounds Valve 2V/4V Mk2 will have slightly different sound characteristics due to the tubes, but am I right in thinking that tubes and faders aside, the MS Valve and UA elara.4 are essentially the same mixer? FWIW I already have the Mastersounds FX which would pair perfectly with the elara.4 (or MS Valve 2V/4V).

Other contenders are ARS Model 1100 and the Can Electric Taula MR...

Anyone been able to compare yet or at least give the elara.4 a go? How would you describe the sound? Is build quality perfect?"
"Hi, I recently got a DDJ XP2 and i was wondering if there’s any way to change the pad modes, for example making one of the modes manage the stems instead of the loops or something like that. Or to use it to control the samples. Any help would be appreciated (I’m using serato) - the setup is 2 pioneer cdj 900 and a nexus 900 mixer. Thanks"
"I know it's been addressed already, realize it's a known issue, and I really like the headphones anyway, but does anyone else have to sort of wiggle or push into place one or both of the Left / Right earcup cables every time they use the headphones to ensure the sound doesn't cut out?  And even then, the sound still sometimes cuts out or lowers?  On my pair I feel like I'm always having to mess with the left cable as the left side cuts out frequently, not the right.  It's just annoying.

Has anyone sent theirs back to have this fixed or replaced?"
"Hi everyone. I've been using Traktor for 15 years and was gifted an NS6ii some time ago, and it has been collecting dust in a corner, as I'm not fond of Serato and don't intend to switch over. I recently pulled it out and started creating a map of all the basic features (cue, play, volume faders, etc.).

I wanted to move on to the more complex aspects involving Midi Out. After a lot of trial and error, I mapped the volume of Decks A and B to the appropriate VU meter (ch01.cc.031 and ch02.cc.031 respectively). When trying to map the Master Volume to the controller's LED, I discovered, when checking the drop-down list of midi out options, there are 16 channels, each has 127 ""sub-channels"" and about 30 additional ""notes"" that can be assigned to a function. Meaning there are thousands of needles in the haystack when searching for the right one!

My question is as follows: is there any way, any software, I could use to find each function of the midi controller in question beforehand so that I can know what to map to it, instead of the reverse? For example (as dumb and science-fiction-y as it may sound), something that triggers each possible midi channel for half a second so that it lights up and shows me what the right midi address is?

Alternatively, any simpler way to find out how to map a Traktor function (specifically the Master Volume L+R) to the appropriate LED?"

i’ve been mixing on a 92 for awhile. love it. found a deal on a 96 and thought i’d give it a try. seems like an upgrade in almost every way but two: no lfo on the filters and the faders are way tighter than on the 92. i like how loose the faders on the 92 are — i can do super quick cuts really easily — but the 96 faders feel much more sticky and slow like they’re not meant to be moved fast. anyone else experience this or is this just an issue with my particular mixer?
"Hi all. I have moved to a new country, and finally saved enough money to transport my 2x1200 and my vinyl collection here, but there is no mixer. In past I used Numark M6 USB and was happy with it. Now I need to get a mixer, and I while checking for what's available on 2nd hand market here, I found few decent priced Z2's in good condition. 

I understand that this model is discontinued, and is basically more than 10 years old.  But in terms of outputs (RCA for Master output + TRS for booth monitor) and the presence of audio interface (*I've always been a Traktor guy, so NI stuff is usually perfect for me*) it is exactly what I need. And the size, too - I don't need a 4 channel mixer, and I prefer my mixer to be not too big (the table I'm going to build will be rather small, just for 2 1200 and a mixer). 

My only concern is Z2 being an old model, and if it breaks down, I will hardly be able to repair it. And also I am not quite sure if the modern Traktor Pro 3 supports it well. Anyone here using Z2 in their setup? How does hold up until now? I can get a used Z2 for €250. "
So I bought about 125 tracks recently with the sale on Beatport. Go to download the tracks and it looks like it maxes out at 100 tracks to download.

Is there an easier solution to getting access to this? The search function on old tracks is useless. It hasn't worked.

"Thinking of retiring my collection of over 6 years old,  putting it away &amp; starting a complete new one, 
How many of you out there have done it &amp; how did you feel about it when you did it?

Been mixing lately &amp; I just feel like I keep gravitating to the same old tracks that I've played &amp; recorded, &amp; when listening to tracks I know I haven't played I still end up looking for something I've already played before.

I might just go through rekordbox &amp; see the play counts &amp; try &amp; hide the tracks deeper in a folder to take them out of rotation

"Upon turning on the mixer, all channels are like this. Turning up the bass or mid causes the level to grow about four dots or so. When plugging in my turntables I'm getting no sound from either of the phono outputs. Any ideas of what could be the problem and what I can do to remedy it?"
"Context: I started out playing hardgroove and hypnotic techno digitally and I've transitioned to playing on vinyl and digital combined lately. My tempo and beat matching has been getting pretty decent so I have no problems mixing techno.

Question: Now I was asked to play an 80s funk/soul/disco set with tracks mostly in the range from 100 to 130 BPM. While doing my selection and testing the tempo and beat matching I noticed that playing most of these at plus or minus 10 percent or even more (my Reloop RP-7000s can do 8, 16 or 50) just sounds shitty most of time, especially on vocals.

How would you go about doing transitions from say 105 to 125 or vice versa? I use a Xone:92 mixer without any external effects so echo out, etc are not an option for me. I've tried literally ignoring the tempo and doing a crossfader transition and bass swap at the right moment and that sounds decent but not great and I feel like there has to be more to it."
"This is something that’s been buzzing in my head for a while. 

There’s this stigma, that the DJ has to play what I like to call “surface level” music. Meaning what’s popular and what makes people dance and safe to play. 

AND THEN there’s the music you curate to deemed very creative, funky, and eclectic selection of music. Everything is mixed in well, in key and maintaining a nice groove. But you damn well if you played this set people would be like WTF is this I’m leaving this place. 

The genre of music I’m referring to is of course house music. But this can me related in any genre of music.

Anyone ever think this?"
"Why have so many mixers and controllers gone away with the button for putting the master in your headphones?

It’s ridiculous.  So many scenarios of environments where there’s isn’t booth speakers or you’re far away from the speakers.  Or maybe there’s no speakers at all cause you’re recording a mix or have to be quiet… 

All these mixers and controllers I gotta slide a slider and twist a tiny little knob.

I almost always leave the Cue on my master.  Sometimes I shut it off momentarily for a reason.
I engage cue on a channel when/if I need it. 
I keep my cue/master knob mainly at 12 o clock.  Sometimes change it momentarily.

Like wtf"
