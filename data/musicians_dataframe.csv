"Of all the bands I‚Äôve been in and put together, the singer is by far the hardest position to fill. I‚Äôm looking to put another band together soon, but I am hesitating because I know how difficult it is to find a lead singer who doesn‚Äôt act like a dick. In my last band I decided to sing because we could not find a singer. The problem is, I hated it the whole time. I hate singing and I‚Äôm not good at it. I‚Äôve tried finding singers on Craigslist, Facebook, open mics etc. Lead singer disease is a very real problem. Has anyone here had any luck finding a decent, committed singer? "

"I was thinking that I could finish one music project per month (in the middle of my heavy schedule full of non-music related stuff) but, I guess I was delusional. üòÜ

As much as I love making music, I can't push myself to work on it as fast as possible...

Making music is supposed to be relaxing and enjoyable.

In anyway I don't think I'm that good in making music. I'm like at a super beginner level..."
"I was listening to the Bandsplain podcast about Pearl Jam, and the host made a passing comment about how in the late 90s/early 00s bands would create indie labels to put out their records in hopes of their label then getting bought by a bigger label. Did I misunderstand or is this true? And if it's true,  what was the thinking behind this? Was it easier to set up your own label rather than send a demo or get noticed by an established label?"

Hey so I am a hobbyist front man singer at open mics and stuff. Maybe do this 2 a week. Im about to take a serious break from music. But i was wondering after seeing blue collar musicians who do this as a living. How do they cope from burn out. I realized that trying to figure out what people want is a motherf\*ckin bitch sometimes and it takes a toll. Most musicians dont have that theatrical mindset to separate the stage and non stage so I wanted to know how do people cope from playing too much music? Is that a thing? Please share 
"I had a friend - musician. We met in the same band and over the course of years became very close friends. He spent New Years' at our home, my son liked him, we went through many highs and lows during our 7 year friendship/musicianship.

It came even to the point that together we left our former band and formed a new one. There, we worked on everything together as a creative duo - songwriting, concepts, graphics, booking etc. Finally, the band was getting noticed, we also had few shows booked when suddenly out of the blue he wrote a message on the band groupchat that he is leaving the band cause he wants to play more and he had other band as well which gigged more and he didn't want to split his time. He also said that the genre we played didn't appeal to him anymore. I tried to persuade him to stay but he said his mind was made-up. I then wrote that since he was my creative twin and was responsible for at least half the stuff that was going on with the band, I don't see a reason to continue this band. He said that it's my sole decision and he has nothing to do with that.

Now, until now it would be a fairly normal thing. Bands break-up. What was not normal that we being closed friends, I noticed few weeks before his leaving that something was off. I asked him if something was wrong and he said he was just tired. But in reality, he has already made his mind up then and let us go in the dark, book shows, give interviews and promote our music. Couple of weeks later, he suddenly joined another band and resurrected his old project playing same genre as he said he wasn't into anymore.

Then this year I found out he gave interview where they asked him about his former band with me and he basically told them it was my sole decision to end it and he had nothing to do with it.

I feel betrayed and feel like he is a disloyal, self-centered prick. But when I talkes to some people they didn't see it as a big deal. So is it a big deal or not?"

"There was a thread recently about what to do when you make mistakes on stage (the consensus answer being to not acknowledge the mistake and just move on), and it reminded me of an insightful note from a book on acting by David Mamet (called *True and False*), where he said that when people come up to you after a show and say how great the show was or how great you were, the *only* acceptable answer is to smile and say, ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù That is, you should NOT say, ‚ÄúNo, we were off tonight‚Ä¶ I made mistakes‚Ä¶ the sound was bad, etc.‚Äù

That really rang true for me when I read that because I realized that I had done that exact thing several times, both with theater shows and music gigs. But the thing is, the audience had their own experience of the performance, which in all likelihood included no perception whatsoever of the ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù or ‚Äúbad sound‚Äù or whatever felt so important and bad to you. You have now put a stain on what might have been their honest and real enjoyment of the performance. Or, maybe they did realize that you were a little off, but they‚Äôre trying to be nice and now you‚Äôre shitting on that, which just adds to the negative experience. Smile and say ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù Then practice more for next time.

There‚Äôs also an amazing story from Jerry Garcia, where he describes being so upset about how bad the Grateful Dead had played a certain show that he pushed bassist Phil Lesh down a flight of stairs after the gig. A few months later, listening to the recording of that show, it was deemed to be so good that they used several tracks for a live album. The lesson again being that we as performers can‚Äôt have the perspective in the moment to understand the value of what we‚Äôre doing in terms of what matters to the audience. So really, don‚Äôt sweat it, regardless."

"Hi all, this is kind of a fun one I guess. Just curious in which order you all credit your musicians/contributors on your album/singles and where do you credit them in the digital world? I'm referring to where the public might see this information (like videos, bios, etc.), not for entering metadata when uploading tracks. 

For reference, I'm referring to the following roles:

Songwriter(s): Lyrics &amp; Music

Instruments: Vocals, Guitar, Bass, Drums, Keys, Additional Instruments

Recording Engineer, Mixing Engineer, Mastering Engineer

Producer

Video director, Artwork, and/or Photographer (if applicable)

In addition, where in the order would you list where your song(s) is available and your social media handles? Before or after songwriting/production credits?

"The amount of times I hear other musicians say ‚Äúoh only a bassist would know and hear that‚Äù or something similar.

Edit: now that I think about it, it was probably more of a compliment maybe, because I could notice a subtle difference when listening to a certain song that he couldn‚Äôt hear or didn‚Äôt bother to take notice. Also I‚Äôve never really been told to turn down much by my fellow band members, just some sound engineers.

"At the age of 10 I started playing the guitar, but not frequently, I had some distractions along the way. I have a guitar that I play from time to time, I don't consider myself advanced, maybe between beginner and intermediate, I play especially blues stuff, which is one of my favorite genres. Sometimes I feel like I've lost my taste for this instrument. It's strange, because it's like this taste goes away and comes back from time to time.

On the other hand, jazz, R&amp;B, progressive rock, funk, soul are other genres that I enjoy a lot in addition to blues and for a couple of years I have realized that I love and enjoy the work done by the piano, the keyboards and the bass in these genres. I like the ability of the piano, keyboards and synthesizers to create a sea of emotions in the songs and the bass with its ability to carry the rhythm (I consider myself good at carrying the rhythm) and the melody, it is capable of saying a lot with a few notes, unlike playing thousand-note guitar solos, which personally don't convey much to me.

I was thinking about getting a second-hand bass and using that guitar skill, but I'm still confused. I would appreciate if someone could help me solve this :((

I apologize if the grammar is not the best, it is not my first language."
"I've been playing live for a few years now on and off, and one problem I (we) always run into is that somebody needs to adjust their drums or retune their guitar, so they say ""wait wait wait""... and we get into a bad habit of saying ""are you ready"", ""yeah"", ""are you ready"", ""yeah"", ""are you ready"", ""yeah"", and finally start playing after some dead time on stage.  I'm the singer so I do my best to fill that time, but I kind of run out of things to say... have you developed tricks to keep things moving along rather than asking each other?"

"Hello there. So I have some demos of my original songs from years ago, which I would like to release next year as a few singles (at least 2 or 3 of them) and then eventually an album. I'm just going to do an at-home re-recording of them as I really don't have much budget, but I want to put my creations out there. It's been a long-time dream for me and friends who support me.

Recently I've been reading about music distribution services here and people's experiences with them, and it's worrying to see that many have had bad ones with almost all of them, like their music suddenly being taken down which I fear could also happen to me.

What do you recommend is the safest option for me? My preferences include:

* Budget-friendly (maybe $40 annually is the upper limit)
* Has the option to release music during specific dates since the numbers have significance to my album concept
* Includes creation of Spotify for Artists account (my friends want to stream my songs there specifically)
* Customer service that would at least allow me to contact them should they upload my songs to the wrong artist account (somebody already has the same stage name :/ though they aren't that big too)
* Would not take down songs out of nowhere because all I want is just to get the music out there (I'm not even that concerned about earnings and sales)

Your thoughts and sharing of experiences would mean a lot. Thank you!"

"Here's the situation. First off, we're not a gigging band, but previously had very good success with our debut album on streaming platforms. 

One of my band members paid for a bot traffic service without informing the rest of us until after they paid for it. We all thought it was a stupid idea and were naturally worried something would happen. 

The song in question was soon after removed from Spotify. No surprises there.  Our artist profile and back catalogue remains but no longer do we appear in the algorithm. 

We used to get around 20k+ visits from Spotify radio and algo, discovery, release radar etc plays each month. Fantastic organic fan growth. 

Since the song removal we get 0 from these. We are left only with the streams we get from our existing active audience and other incidental playlists we are on. 

I will save my huge feeling of resentment and how I'm no longer emotionally attached to the songs I wrote for our soon to be released third album and how this is pushing me to just go solo for another Reddit post. 

I guess the question is as per the title. If you suddenly had Spotify removed as your main streaming platform, would you just accept it and focus on other platforms, maybe bandcamp? Or would this be a major deal breaker?

Also, if you're in a band - don't be a dick or think with your dick. Bot farms are fucking stupid. Make sure you lay down these rules for your band. I can't believe I even am writing this as we already had the discussion about how they're all fake listeners so it's pointless metric inflation. "

"Hello, I'm not a musician as a career but I have practiced Violin and Piano quite a bit before on the side. I noticed there are so many assumptions about what being a musician is like (some think it is a way to stardom and others think it is so impractical to earn much at all, and I don't hear much about what outside practicing is like). Pretty much anything I heard about the field has not been from anyone who is highly involved, so I thought asking a forum of musicians would be an effective way for anyone here to learn more."
Im a senior in high school about to graduate but my friend runs a fashion club and wants me to play the drums with our friend jay at the show. I love the request and i am so excited to do it but i have stage fright. I can get on the stage and do anything but when i'm in front of a bunch of people about to play any instrument my legs wobble like hell. With the guitar i can probably get away with it but for the drum kit i rlly cant. So this question may be basic but is there ANYTHING any of you know to calm nerves when performing?? It is so bad and i've had it ever since i first picked up instruments. I play very well but my shakiness can be overwhelming.

"Now, what if you just because those instrumentals are not exclusive created by yourself your music is not actually your music but producer's music?
How much does it matter:
-The Vocals
-The Lyrics
-The Artworks
-The Mix &amp; Mastering
-The Business/income money
Compared to the case when your instrumentals are not created by you in what terms your music can be or not actually your music?

Let's ask something different: how much does the vocalist  matter compared to the whole band for example.?

If you are a singer, song-writer, you can also mix and do artworks but you prefer to collab with some producers or beat Makers how much this choice will affect your career and what people will think? and what does really matter how much of your music it's just you ? 

Why do I feel like artists singing on instrumentals that aren't theirs it cannot be counted as their music even they are collaborating and working hard to actually sing for that instrumental/beat?"
"Hey. I ask this question because there are certain aspects to being a part of music that makes you a stronger, more open person. But where, in your experience have you seen it just destroy a person?

"I've been experimenting with promoting my music on TikTok using short clips of some tracks accompanied by some images, text etc.

When I listen to the sound in the sounds menu and during editing it sounds fine and as it is supposed to. I am not changing the volume level of the sound in editing. However, once I post the video, the sound quality gets totally destroyed. It sounds like it's clipping and pumping a limiter like crazy. I am assuming it is something to do with volume normalisation.

Anyone else have any experience with posting on TikTok and found any workarounds? Thanks

Edit: although the mastering could definitely be better, after some testing I‚Äôve found that lowering the volume slightly on the added sound track helps reduce the problem"

"If so, how has it gone?

I have had a channel up since december - I treat it as a shelf to place dressed-up versions of my songs (I do some animation and video-editing).  I have basically no expectations, and don't promote it, but have slowly climbed up to about 50-150 views per.

I could fairly easily create a mini-and-skinny version of the videos for YouTube Shorts, to maybe help boost them a bit. But wondering if it's even worth the effort. I don't mind the effort honestly, but if all it's going to do is bring grief (comments like ""why is this in my feed"" or whatever), I won't bother.

I usually create music for myself, and really enjoy just messing around with making stuff. I do post it on my social media (which doesn't have many followers - only like 200).

I am a solo musician more or less living in the electronic/dreampop/psychedelic space. I will have enough music done soon to start performing live. The performance issue I am running into is I don‚Äôt have a backing band and most of my instrumentals are fairly involved, so just playing a guitar or something would really kill the essence of the songs. I also tend to have somewhat long instrumental bits where there is no singing.

My thought to get around this is to use my Eyesy and a projector to have visuals going the whole time (and give me something to do with my hands) and to essentially sing ‚Äúkaraoke‚Äù to instrumental tracks I‚Äôll be launching from Ableton.

Anybody in a similar boat? What is your setup/how do you approach live performance? Any and all ideas and suggestions are welcome.

Thanks!

"hi everyone,

practically all musicians have experienced or will experience making mistakes live. you may be organized, you may have rehearsed and studied a lot, but if you're unlucky enough not to be on a good day, you can end up making mistakes. there are many variables that are sometimes beyond our control.

depending on the type of mistake (be it subtle or explicit), people may remember the situation, someone may talk badly about you behind your back, etc. it's a lot of exposure and the act of performing can be something terrible at times. it's part of the job. most of the musicians I know, apart from myself, tend to be very self-critical. and sometimes it's tough to deal with it after a concert.

so how do you deal with this kind of situation? is there any story you'd like to share?"

"My music has more electronic components and many layers of instruments including background vocals. I have played my songs with an acoustic guitar which fits in with songwriter showcases and open mics. 
But there are other local bands (and artists w full bands) that I would love to play live shows with and would like to play my songs in a way that feel like the recordings. No budget to hire a band and feeling the only way to do this for now is using backing tracks while playing electric guitar and singing. 

Hoping to get any feedback or insight on your experiences using backing tracks for smaller shows. Thanks!

Asked this question on my TikTok after learning that my friends ranged anywhere from 30-60. Trying to talley everyone‚Äôs answers!
"So I live in a small town. I‚Äôm 17, and I have a huge interest in music and being in a band. The problem is, I don‚Äôt really know where to start. None of my friends know how to play an instrument, and I can‚Äôt find anyone else in my town who can AND are interested in being in a band. Specifically a rock or blues band. It makes me really sad sometimes because I‚Äôm really chasing this but I cant really do it solo lol. Trust me, I would if I could.
I am also a little worried. I can play guitar pretty okay, for my age at least, and I like to believe I can sing decently. I consider myself more of a song writer than anything. I am just afraid that I‚Äôm not good enough at my instrument to actually make decent music, even if I do have other people. If I find those other people, what if they‚Äôre TOO good for me? I also wouldn‚Äôt know how to measure how skilled I am, and when I am good enough to actually have a band.

Does anyone have any advice / tips on this kind of thing? How to find people, measure my/our skill, or get it started in general? Thanks in advance. :]"

"Hi

Let's start the new month right.

Let's write, record and release at least 1 song in 3 months.

Month 1:

Month 2:
Recording

Month 3:

Took the idea from here:

https://youtu.be/TMdx42kgBUw

But you get the idea.

It's starting in May, but you can change the starting month/date depending on when you find/read this.

The goal is to reduce overwhelm and get to make and release more music every month/year.

That's it.

If you decide to take this challenge, good luck! üçÄ

So, am I the ass or what? At some point it‚Äôs like if he pulled more weight I‚Äôd totally form a band but I feel like I‚Äôm doing all the lifting and will compromise myself by forming a ‚Äúband‚Äù‚Ä¶

"Hi All,

I hope we are all doing well and we all keep making music we enjoy!

I am still a very new artist with 200 monthly listeners with only 5 songs released and one of my songs just got added to 'Radio' by spotify yesterday (only 10 streams). I was wondering is this spotify playlist a good sign or do most artists get added to this playlist made by spotify?  Also out of intrigue if it is a good sign which spotify playlist is the best to get added to, such as discover weekly, radio, release radar or your daily mix? Apologies if this is a silly question.

Thanks"

"You already know this. Just wanted to share that years ago I wrote a python algorithm that tracked anyone who interacted with my socials, and would return support in kind. If the interaction did not continue, after 30 days my program also stopped returning support. In other words, as long as you continue to support me, I'd continue to support you. If you stop, I stop. My database currently for instagram has +/-4950 inactive users, and about 50 active users. At a ratio of approx 100:1, other musicians fein support for a minute but not consistently. This is fine because ""other musicians"" are not my target audience and I totally understand that which is why I wrote the program to handle it for me. But If you want to play the game where we support each other, I'm down lol. Just something to keep in mind when you hear the familiar bitching that bands don't support one another and if only we did that somehow we would all be successful. The person doing the bitching is most often an inactive user in my database."
"Hey there folks
I'm doing a report at University about equality in the music industry. If you could take part it would really be appreciated. It should only take a couple of minutes to complete

"Okay full disclaimer I'm super curious because I myself (imposter musician) only have a corner of my bedroom set up for music in a way that's cluttered and very inaccessible (having to move things around before I can do anything - crowded bedroom with my partner). And I'm starting to suspect that this is negatively impacting my musical-ness (eg feeling uninspired cuz can't act on and try out ideas whenever).

Anyway, so I'm wondering, in particular, what are some things about/in your workspace that inspire you? Whether thats encouraging you to play, or something that helps get ideas flowing, etc.

More random brainstorming questions:

What does your musical workspace/studio look like? Do you have a whole room (or rooms!) dedicated to music? Are your equipment set up in an inspiring way? Or are you more laid back and have things randomly scattered?

How would you describe your musical habit? As in, are you very disciplined and have dedicated and structured practice schedules? Or do you just play whenever? Is your whole life practically all music, doing music all the time? Or is it more just a small portion of your life that you have to carve out time for?

"I am casual weekend warrior Solo guitar performer - would like to put together a EPK video to share to new places to play. I have Xair mixer and would like to record a video that provides sound from the mixer and a synced video. 

Asking to see what camera/Mixer combo you use to synce video with sound from mixer? or what other things you did to provide a good Press kit to share. Just cant get a good enough video via Phone that has great balanced sound and good quality video. Perhaps its just a good camera that records good sound. Ive had a Zoom Q2n-4k and it still doesnt provide what i am after.

"I'm fairly disabled. I get needs are different depending on circumstances, of course, but what instruments would you say are fairly accessible to most disabled people? I think the music industry is fairly inaccessible, so I want to start this discussion.

I, personally, have issues with my body. I have low stamina, I cannot hold my arms up long because of my joints. I also have very small hands and fingers. Because of this, I'm not able to play most instruments, like the guitar, or drums, when I tried the saxophone, I ended up with a band of bruises from where it had touched my stomach! What instruments do you recommend for someone like me, as well? I can sing, and do a bit of clarinet."

"Hey everyone!  
  
One of the biggest struggles that my group of musician peers seemed to have when starting out was finding a producer in their area to collaborate with, to the point that I would often step in to help them - even if my production skills are not the best since I am mainly a singer/songwriter. 

This got me thinking - what if there was a platform that could efficiently connect singers and producers and break that barrier to entry a little bit? It would be a place where singers could post what they are looking for from a producer and what their budget is, and producers could respond with some tracks they have worked on in the past as well as their rates. I think some great matches and tracks could come out of it!

Curious to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think this could make your life easier as a musician or producer? Would you find such a platform interesting?

Look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts!"
"So this is slightly a rant/genuine questions. I've been putting my own original music out there for the past year and somehow cannot seem to get past my goal of 100 listeners on Spotify. I don't think my music itself is bad (I hope not...y'all can be the judge of that I suppose). But I have no idea how to build a fan base. I try to do the old fashioned way by giging around the city and playing shows which helps a tad as I tend to get a boost after shows. I have a TikTok/insta and post some covers and originals (all well lit and decent audio) and those do ok but never any retention ony streams. I tried my hand with a few submit hub pitches with my song Tuesday blue and it did ok but some many places them on playlists I'm convinced no one listens to üòÇ.

I just released my 5th single and am about to drop an EP in the next month but have no idea how to get anyone but my friends to listen/know about it. I don't have the time or mental bandwidth to put into tiktok s and don't mind interacting with people ony reels if they want covers etc but it's tough going. I've even tried stalking down and reaching out to playlist curators. I have gotten some radio play but what have y'all done thats been effective. Anything is appreciated tips tricks etc. thanks y'all have a good one

Imma share my Spotify so be nice if ya will

Piano is right next to a window &amp; when the sunlight hit the keyboard or sheet music, often I find it very hard to keep playing without getting distracted because it‚Äôs so bright. Happens even if I already memorized the music and know it through muscle memory. Is this normal/does anyone relate?

Also say if you have any sensory issues"
"My band has been on in-ear monitoring for around 4 years now. Quite early on, I got cheap custom molds from a small manufacturer here in Germany. While at first they were pretty good, the fit got a lot worse over time. Now the left side doesn't really seal anymore, only when I press them into the ear which isn't very practical as a guitar player.

I'm trying to figure out which IEMs to get next. Some people swear that a tight seal while sweating and singing is only feasible with soft/silicone molds. Others say they never had any problems with their hard/acrylic molds.

Going with silicone dramatically reduces the number of vendors I can go with and I heard they have to be replaced more frequently. Also, many people seem to be just find with acrylic ones. Maybe my old molds were just faulty?

What are your experiences with energetic live shows and IEMs?"
"I've been learning classical piano for quite some time I would say I'm late intermediate, I love classical music but I also love pop/jazz/contemporary music and I don't like the disconnect in term of what I'm capable to do.

It's frustrating only being able to play a specific piece after months of refining, I love to play for others but  when I do it's always like, ""hey do you wanna hear this 3 minute Bach invention that I've been learning for 2 months?"" Nerves kick in, I put all my mental energy in those 3 minutes an boom it's gone, sure I played fine, and then it's like, hey what else do you know? Umm.. well I have this other piece that I'm working on... Or that piece that I haven't played in 2 weeks that its not polished.... I tend not to hoard repertoire to increase my turn over and improve my reading/overall ability. In a nutshell I feel that learning piece at my level take too much bandwidth for very little reward.

I know my theory and can play I-IV-V-I voice leadings well but I can't play interesting rythms or voicings let along sing over my chords. I want to be able to accompany my family while they sing traditional folk songs and be able to pick up the harmonies by ear because most of the time they just play songs from their childhood in Spotify and start singing, I can't really find good sheet music arrangements. I'm talking about Mexican folk songs, rancheras, corridos, boleros, latin  stuff. Sometimes my aunt brings her guitar and somehow knows dozens of songs to go the whole afternoon, she mixes it up with licks/fills/solos and never sounds repetitive even if it's the same chord progression. it's a very musical atmosphere that I can't follow at the piano, I feel constrained by sheet music and my memory like I can't speak their language.

Although the genre Is not jazz, would learning jazz help me follow along those type of scenarios? I work better with a structure and it seems that jazz is the most academic genre besides classical that can actually teach you how to ""jam"". I haven't had good results trying to pick up stuff from YouTube."
Hello! I am a guitar player and I‚Äôve been having trouble adapting new ways of playing. I started playing while listening to a ton of Grateful Dead and Allman Brothers music. Still love it but I‚Äôve definitely broadened since then. I‚Äôm a way bigger Wilco (Nels Cline) and Zappa fan and I get what they‚Äôre doing and I listen to them obsessively but when I hear a chord progression I can‚Äôt get out of that Allman/Garcia way of playing it. Any advice?
"I‚Äôm in a small band that‚Äôs been garnering some decent social media attention as well as building a local following. We‚Äôve had to music management companies express interest in working with us for a small fee. They promise to book us on shows, tours, get us on playlists, etc‚Ä¶. 

I was wondering from people with experience if this is worth it? Do most successful bands or artists skip the whole working with a management company phase or is it something we should consider and something that can help us get to the next level? "
"I don‚Äôt think I get treated that well in my band. For reference we are a high school band and we are actually doing very well in the local music scene. Im the bass player and most of our songs really rely on my funky and complex bass lines I really enjoy playing. The problem isn‚Äôt that I‚Äôm not valued musically. The problem is quite literally most everything else.

My band is comprised of me (bass), a drummer, a guitarist/vocalist, and keyboard/trumpet player. The keyboard player and guitarist are constantly making band decisions without anyone else‚Äôs approval, writing lyrics and songs, and I just wish they included me more in the process. I have a lot of ideas and I‚Äôve brought this up to them and then they get defensive. On multiple occasions they have hung out without me and the drummer, start doing band stuff and then make decisions without our approval or involvement and then we‚Äôre just dragged along in the next practices. What‚Äôs very hurtful is that I‚Äôm friends with them. We were all friends before being in a band together so they way that they don‚Äôt include me in things makes me sad. They even hang out after gigs without us and then make lame excuses when I call them out for it. 

I expressed my concerns to the keyboard player who is technically my best friend and she said ‚Äúit seems like everything we do hurts your feelings so I don‚Äôt know how to help you‚Äù which sucked. 

I‚Äôm always getting talked over,, and not posted on our Instagram. Always being told I‚Äôm talented but never treated like I am. 

We screenprint band tshirts at an open studio in our city. Now the first time this happened it was just the keyboard player and guitarist. They made an Uglyass design and I‚Äôve had to roll with it. I was at this studio with the keyboard player just the two of us on a whim last week and I said I wanted to help design shirts and she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna do anything without [guitarists name here]. Which sucked because why do they get to do stuff without me all the time?

I‚Äôm sure it sounds like a no brainer to quit right now but the thing is that I really do like the music we make. And I have a great deal of fun actually just playing the songs. Plus we have gigs already organized in late June. 

It‚Äôs just that all of the social aspects have really taken a toll on me. I used to feel like people value me and now I j feel exhausted and that maybe I‚Äôm the problem. But everyone says I‚Äôm not and I can‚Äôt think of anything I did to get this treatment.

Idk, looking forward to college; maybe I‚Äôll find better people, plus it‚Äôll sting more for the band mates since one of them is going to the same school and one of them is still in high school.

Please, if you have any advice,opinion,words of wisdom, assurance it would all be helpful.

"So, my boyfriend has the clarinet as his main instrument for about a year. Before this he played sax for a bit over a year. 
He studies a lot and is very dedicated to music! I love this about him. But he is facing a struggle for some time now...
He says he can't remember songs that he knows how to play without looking at the notations. Earlier this year he refused to go to a presentation because he was unable to memorize the songs. I felt so bad for him.
Last week he was so frustrated that he cried a little and it broke my heart. He says he feels like less of a musician because people ask him to play something and he can't without having the notation. 
He thinks it's a problem with memory, because he can't memorize stuff like his social security number. 

Is there anything that I suggest him that he might haven't tried yet? Or should I just give him some consolation on this? 

I work in healthcare and I told him we have some cheat notes with reference numbers, because we don't need to know everything. Not a good example IDK, I just would like to help a bit. "

"Personally I've never been so big but I have at least gotten some decent stream numbers over the years.  I have noticed though some people in chullhop and even more in the indie rock scene (IE- the lead singer of Grizzly Bear) either quitting music outright or at least as their full time/main job, etc.

It actually feels reassuring to me in a way knowing you can do music for fun even with a full time career in something totally different...   I feel like it also highlights how complicated it can be to try to make it in this as well."
"Okay so this is my first song song with actual lyrics (I‚Äôve only ever written soundtrack styled music before) and I‚Äôve found out writing lyrics is so difficult for me and feels so cringey, and I‚Äôd love some feedback. The idea of the song is based on my fear of my own mortality. I decided to personify that fear of mortality with a repo man who deals with organs and human life. I‚Äôm calling him a Reapo man because Grim Reaper funny haha pun. I‚Äôm going for a flamenco/gypsy folky influence but the main style is hard rock. 

Anyways here‚Äôs my lyrics so far (I‚Äôm not finished but I‚Äôd love feedback for what I have now)

*Verse 1*

I was sitting on my saddle with my mind in a shadow 

And my nag on the gravel on a black winter night 

When he rose from the nettles and he casted his shining blight

üëπThough his mystery was not shoneüëπ

Well my hoar horse reared I know, I know my spine was sheared 

When I dropped straight to the mire

*Pre chorus*

Oh, a fall that took me to higher ground

A cable on my heart brought to my impound

I just need a reapo man to tow me to the shroud, no!

*Chorus 1*

You‚Äôll never take my heart, I‚Äôll never leave behind, I‚Äôll never leave, I‚Äôll never leave a forsaken ambition 

You‚Äôll never take my heart, I‚Äôll never leave behind, I‚Äôll never leave, I‚Äôll never leave an unfinished mission 

*Post chorus*

You‚Äôre never gonna take my life, you‚Äôre never gonna take my life

From me, no

I‚Äôm never gonna leave behind, I‚Äôm never gonna leave behind

Everyone I love

*then a break for music*"

"Just curious how many musicians spend some of thier down time (or breaks between sessions gaming?) I game on and off and am an armchair guitarist. I play my little games sometimes just to break up the practice. 
If you do game what are some of your faves? Do you get inspiration from games? "
"Our band has 2 guitarists, a bass player, and a drummer. Originally, we have been setting up with the drums in the back, bass on the left, guitar on the right, guitar in the center, with the amps placed in line with the bass drum behind each player. 

We are going to be performing at a small basement festival where we will only have sound from our amps, the drums (with a mic‚Äôd kick), and 2 mics connected to speakers.

The problem we are having is originally, we were using an electric kit with speakers, so we had not been playing at a significantly high volume. Now that we have switched to using an acoustic kit, we need to crank our amps quite a bit, which is causing feedback issues with the amps placed behind each player.

How should we go about our stage setup? We won‚Äôt have any monitors so we will need to be able to hear our instruments, but we need a setup that minimizes feedback since we play a lot of high gain.

Edit: Feedback through the guitars, not the vocal mics."
"I normally don‚Äôt feed into comparisons, as I believe we all have a unique journey. HOWEVER, I‚Äôm struggling with this situation and could use some community. I briefly dated a fellow indie musician who quickly became abusive towards me (emotionally, physically &amp; sexually). Was really hard to recover from it all. He recently launched his solo work, after getting married to a wealthy woman who bankrolls him, and as he used to work professional jobs on the label/A&amp;R side, he has a lot of connections and has been able to get some great bookings and press (even though his music is mediocre at best‚Ä¶. Not bitter in that aspect, he‚Äôs just really not that good.) 

I don‚Äôt follow him but we have mutual contacts or have played at same venues, so sometimes I‚Äôm bombarded with his work anyway. I‚Äôve really struggled, despite my talent/training/potential, as I have had serious health problems (a chronic cancer) that really wrecked my trajectory &amp; ability to develop my music &amp; career. Currently my life &amp; finances are in ruin due to these ongoing health problems, and I haven‚Äôt been able to push forward recording projects I have in the works. 

It‚Äôs hard enough with what I‚Äôve gone through/continue to go through, but seeing someone that was cruelly abusive to me advance, while something as tragic as cancer holds me back, really hurts my soul. 

Any words of wisdom or feedback much appreciated. Please keep it kind. I struggle with mental health and am currently in a fragile state. "
"Hello!

This question has been asked many times before I‚Äôm sure but after using the search function I can‚Äôt find the specific answer I‚Äôm looking for. 

I am a singer in a rock band.

I, like many, have a whooshing tinnitus that‚Äôs only gonna get worse. We play loud.

I have tried a wired IEM system but honestly, it pisses me off having to constantly fiddle with EQ and volume trying to find levels I‚Äôm happy with and trying to beat the occlusion effect as much as possible. 

I absolutely hate the occlusion effect, it disconnects me from the band, the crowd, the entire vibe of the show.

I can no longer be bothered with IEMs, I just want to turn up and play. They take up too much time to get right.

Do Loop earplugs / any other form of earplug simply lower the volume of everything but still allow me to hear myself sing?

Are there any other solutions I am unaware of? Customs?

Thanks in advance to anyone who knows the answer!"

"Hey there, just want to gauge some feelings here. When rehearsing with your band, how do you feel about spectators who pop in to watch? My friend has his band over every week for rehearsal, and I know some of the guys, so I usually head over and watch them perform when they're about an hour into their set (not every time, of course). I have no idea if this is considered rude, though, and my friend says it's totally cool. But personally, if I were rehearsing, I'd feel pretty self-conscious if someone who wasn't in the band was just standing there watching me play. How do, or would, you feel about it?

EDIT: Title should say ""yea"", not ""yay"", lol"
"Just looking for some advice and insights, I have about 10 songs now ready to record and have already recorded and released one, in the process of recording more. When producing my debut single, I asked some friends to play parts and hired out mixing and mastering. I did play a few live original shows and asked the same group of friends to back me up but obv they won't do it for free forever. It was alright for playing live but I would not record all my songs the way we arranged them for playing live, I would like to do some stuff with strings and other instruments and not have drums played on every damn song. My question is should I try to form a band or go solo? With a band, there will be other people helping out with booking gigs, production money and promotion etc. and I'll be able to put up good shows, also considering the genre I write in is art rock but I'd prefer to write the songs and the other members come up with their parts and we don't write all together. The other path would be to go solo and I'll have to do everything on my own and hire session players for gigs, which is a bit overwhelming financially but more marketable than a marketing a band, especially nowadays. So, please help me clarify this thing for me and enlighten me if I'm missing something, thank you!"

"Hey. Please entertain this question if you can, if you please dont use this time to bash the question. Im a frontman singer and I noticed that bass players have a different vibe to their demeanor because of the instrument they play.





This is my theory but when you are a bass player, the focus required to hit all the right notes and to control that deep sound requires a focus that is different from the drummer and guitarist. Im a Bob Marley fan, and Aston Barrett is my favorite bassist. Now a guy like Aston, looks like a posterboy of bass playing. He is a quiet man with a deeep voice and has the demeanor of what it takes to play bass. So on a personality level its just so interesting to me. 

  
But am I crazy that to think that bass players have a different edge on their persona, due to their responsibility of bringing bass to the music? Let me know. Thanks."

"Hi guys, I'm a guitarist and pianist, and I've recently also become interested in wind instruments, especially the tin whistle since it's very present in one of my favorite films and its soundtracks, Titanic. I wanted to recreate [this song in this video](https://youtu.be/2V7Fs_w9fH0?si=RK9ALDqxTvRR-iAX&amp;t=46), in the description you can notice that the girl specifies that the tin whistle is in F, but searching online I only found some in C or D, and nowhere in F, or in any case very few and they were very expensive or they could not be shipped to my country. I wanted to know if tin whistles in F are actually so rare to find, or if it is possible to recreate the song in the video also with a tin whistle in C or D, and also what the difference is between the two (for example, which genres can be played with C tuning and which with D?). be understanding, I don't understand much about wind instruments having dedicated years to the piano and guitar :')"

We‚Äôre trying to get to 100 subs on YouTube so we can have a custom URL and all that good stuff before the thing is done. It would be super cool if y‚Äôall could subscribe. Dropping the link in this post. If you message me and show me that you subbed I‚Äôll give early access to the track!

"I‚Äôve been playing guitar for 7 years and accumulated enough songs to finally put them down on a recording session. I‚Äôm excited but know the process is going to be stressful and expensive. Better late then never I suppose‚Ä¶ 31 m btw

Edit: Realized I should have asked for advice or lessons when it comes to your first album. Is it important just to get it out without over thinking it?"
"Sorry if I am asking a question that has been asked many times prior but getting advice that feels actually relevant to me is somewhat difficult. Music is one of those things that there isn't necessarily a ""correct"" way to do it which is good and bad in my opinion as it makes it harder for me to figure out where I should even start since there is simply SO much to music. And the best ways of learning music are unique to the person learning.

I am very interested in learning the piano (how to play and write) and did actually take lessons for about a year or two in the past, but unfortunately a lot happened during that time, the person who was teaching me is no longer able to.  So essentially I stopped playing and taking lessons for the most part I still did occasionally learn another song.

I would love to get back into it but with where I am now I just don't really even know where to start I know lessons are probably the best way of learning because I wouldn't need to worry about doing research into what I will need to learn but I have an issue where if it isn't a song I hear and like enough to actively want to play then I won't be able to get motivation to play it. (yes I know that is not a good thing I just don't know how to fix it) but knowing that I do not believe lessons would be the best choice for me. 

If I just simply wanted to learn how to read and play the piano it wouldn't be the ""best"" way of doing it but I would be able to by quite literally just playing songs until I get better so my question does still pertain to playing but is mostly talking about writing music. Now having a little vague bit of information about my experiences with music does anyone have any advice for how I could try and get back into learning?

  
- Thank you all for reading this I again apologize if this is a question that has been asked too many times and if it is feel free to just ignore it. But if any of you feel like you would be able to offer any advice at all it would be greatly appreciated. "
"Just joined up with a local band, they needed a second guitarist for a show that's coming up in less than a week.

Heyyy ü•∫ 21 F and I struggle with OCD and ADHD. One of the main themes I‚Äôm having right now with my OCD is fear of uncertainty and ruminating and spiralling in anxiety. I have a big live gig coming up and I think lots of people I know are coming to see me because I think my music has sparked excitement among my community. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs gonna be a sold out show. It‚Äôs a restaurant show but still it‚Äôs the biggest show for me. I‚Äôm so excited (when I‚Äôm not anxious) because I‚Äôm at a point in my music career where I‚Äôm not in the crap stage anymore and I‚Äôm actually making stuff that‚Äôs unique and engaging and people that are super talented and experienced want to work with me. 

I‚Äôm currently freaking out to the point of diarrhea about ‚Äòwhat if I forget my lyrics?‚Äô How do I resolve this concern? Especially since my OCD is taunting me with ‚Äòyou cannot be absolutely certain you won‚Äôt forget your lyrics so there‚Äôs nothing you can do but stress about it and replay imagined scenarios in your head about you forgetting.‚Äô Please don‚Äôt say ‚Äòdon‚Äôt be anxious or else you‚Äôll forget‚Äô because that makes it worse. Recently I was so anxious public speaking that I completely forgot a spiel I do at work every morning. My mind blanked. But I ended up recovering but how do I recover if this happens on stage?

I‚Äôve performed live on multiple occasions already. I‚Äôve started to trust myself that I won‚Äôt forget until just yesterday I was performing a song for a video that my audio engineer friend was recording. I was starting to get excited for my gig until a forgetting incident happened yesterday. It was a song that I recently performed live without issue a week prior. I stopped because my mind blanked on a line in the song and my guitarist stopped strumming and I felt like my world was caving in. I said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not in the right head space can we take a break for five minutes?‚Äô And I left the room and I couldn‚Äôt even remember the line while I was trying to think of it while walking out of the room. 

I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that maybe the autonomic part of my brain knew the line but not the hyperconcious part of my brain? I went to the parking lot and read the line and my brain ate the material as actual words that cemented into my mind instead of this abstract thing that would pop up if i promoted it correctly with the line leading up to it. 

Id appreciate any help as this anxiety is very distressing for me and I can‚Äôt let my fears get in the way of me bringing live music to my friends and family and my world cause it means a lot to me and a lot to everyone around me. I really want to be excited for this gig and I HATE having an upset stomach and feeling dread. Unfortunately I can‚Äôt simply ‚Äòtrick‚Äô my brain because it‚Äôs hyper conscious, so I need to approach this very intelligently. You may understand what I mean if you are OCD. 

Since I am a shame based person I can easily start over practicing and that is NOT GOOD FOR ME. Where‚Äôs that sweet spot where I can tell myself ‚ÄòI‚Äôve done just enough and not too much. The rest will just have to be what it is.‚Äô "

"I play keys in a band and use an expression pedal for certain patches such as pads and B3.

Guitarist wants me never to adjust the keyboard volume because he wants to mix recordings post performance.

We don't have a sound engineer in the front so I feel the need to balance my output for some songs using the pedal and sometimes forget to push it forward on songs that I don't use it.

As a photographer my philosophy was ""get it right in the camera"" rather than ""fixing it in post.""

Should I just nix the expression pedal? How do other keyboardists handle this?

"Basically I want to be a singer since a kid. 
I went to school's vocal lessons for 3 years, then to a somewhat professional teacher for half a year and now I have one year at a professional school full of experienced artists, there I get individual lessons with a professional teach. Yet, I don't seem to be able to have a clean voice, reach notes that are high (sometimes only) and I lack confidence. 
I have many songs written, but by songs I mean just lyrics, I have such cool ideas for songs like for the lyrics, mv and melodies but I just can't put it all together. 
I've have and electric guitar for like 2 years now, but I know only a few chords and can't play songs from start to finish, I can't make music with my guitar because I just don't know how to make music, I'm in a band but I'm always just playing easy power chords.

"Most of the time it's about competition, there's tons of...assault vibes, tons of emotional aggression.  It sounds like a nightmare with certain communities in different locations.

And for me, I do want to be welcoming to others, and I want to push others to be their best in my local community.  So I was curious if there were any observations by musicians when it comes to behaviors/actions of others around them, and what could have been done to make it better or more welcoming."
I live in central WV and have been working on getting a band together since the start of the year. I have 2 guys plus myself who are fully on board but we haven't been able to keep a guitar player. I play bass and I'm a little heavy handed with it so it doesn't sound completely empty without a guitarist but man I just want the higher ranges to be filled with something because the potential is certainly there. Problem is I've exhausted my options in terms of personal contacts and social media hasn't been much help. I'm really just considering doing this without guitar. I've heard people describe our sound as a cross between green day and Primus. Anyways I'm looking for advice on how to find a player that'll fit the sound and also be dedicated.

"Just a little background on me : I (M27) used to produce a lot of music a few years back 
But then life happened, I got a job which kept me busy
To keep the musician inside me alive, I took up live gigs during the weekend, and some freelance (guitar) sessions for other artists 

However, my productions skills have tanked since 
I have a good sense of music, but can't mix music even if my life was at line 

I feel like getting back into production so that I can make and record my own songs rather than relying on people 

Musicians, what is a roadmap you would follow if you were stuck in such a situation 

Ps. I still remember the basic of production so I don't have to start from scratch "

The last few years ive spent going back and forth between making music with beats, more trap/witch house adjacent music and indie/alternative styled music. The problem is that there tends to be little crossover between the two, and i feel like im not good at being an artists with the electronic stuff because it doesnt perform as well. Ive wasted years now going back and forth instead of focusing and establishing a following for one thing. 
My question is how do you as musicians know who ‚Äúyou‚Äù are without letting the music you listen to make you go ‚Äúi wanna make THIS kind of music‚Äù"
"I started using an app to write my lyrics in about a year ago. It is convenient since I always have my phone on me, but I'm actually going back to the pen and paper for two reasons. One, it just feels very impersonal when I read my lyrics later on the phone or tablet. Two, I often would type a lyric on the phone and then completely forget about it by the time I got home. I'll remember a piece of paper, and then I'll set it on my piano when I get home, so I'll see it and remember to work on it when I have time. I still use my phone when I just don't have other options, but when possible, I'll use pen and paper.

I have also worked with top music festivals like Rolling Loud and have connections across virtually all major record labels (UMG, Periscope, Dreamville, etc.).

I recently left working directly in the music industry to pursue a career in digital marketing, but I didn‚Äôt realize how much I‚Äôd miss working with exciting new artists. Which brings me to my request. I‚Äôm looking for an opportunity to work alongside an up-and-coming artist on a mission to make it big. I am not looking for any compensation for the work, just an opportunity to grow with an awesome artist.

If you're an independent artist looking to take your music career to the next level, I'd love to hear from you. Whether you're just starting out or already have a following, I can help you develop and execute a comprehensive digital marketing strategy tailored to your specific goals.

"I started learning guitar around 10 years old, and here I am at 28 and I've still never played a show. I'm such a coward about it. I hate eyes on me in any setting. I can play well when I'm alone, but as soon as I have an audience I start screwing up when playing anything that's not simple. Even if I write something cool and tell my wife to come hear it I'll screw it up every single time once she is present, and then when she leaves I'll get it right again. I was in a few bands as a teen and luckily could play in front of the few friends we would occasionally bring to practices, but I was terrified to get on stage when the time came. I was gonna suck it up and deal with it of course because It would have been more embarrassing to tell my friends I was scared, but fortunately we never made it that far so I never had to.

I've recently been getting into singing more, and my buddy and I have been producing some songs with me doing vocals instead of guitar. I kind of dig it and I think I like the idea of singing. But there's even more expectation for a stage presence as a singer because now you're talking to the crowd and people are paying more attention to you, at least as a guitarist I could just hang off to the side and do my thing. We're not even a band, so there's no plan to play any shows anytime soon. But last night I went to a show, and idk it just seemed so easy.  All these casual people just got on stage, did their thing, had fun, and got offstage. I kept just feeling disappointed that I've let so much time go by and haven't just done it yet.

I'm hoping to hear some of your first show nerve stories and how it went / how you felt afterwards to hopefully help me realize I can do it. So let's hear them!"

"Balancing self-expression with serving your audience is crucial for success as an artist. Knowing your target demographic allows you to create content that resonates with them, rather than shouting into the void. 

Your entertainment style (music, fashion, videos, themes, social media, etc) isn‚Äôt for everyone. So who‚Äôs the average fan it‚Äôs for specifically?

Make a list of traits you think they have. For example, a band that sounds like Mumford &amp; Sons will have a disproportionate amount of fans that drive Toyota and Subaru, enjoy hiking, listen to NPR, recycle, etc.

Marketing is a mixture of psychology and sociology. It involves building a brand your niche of followers identify with and nurturing relationships with them through thoughtful content. It's a symbiotic relationship where both artists and fans benefit.

Think less about what fans can do for you and more about what you can do for them.

Hope this helps!

"A band that was on my cover wishlist for a long time and on the top with mercyful fate. This one makes me very very happy.

The purest speed metal band and one band always mentioned when the genre speed metal is talked about. Plus speed metal is my favourite genre. Some more factors like Canadian speed metal being an underrated piece of art. These forces were at work pushing me to cover Exciter.

Also I find the genre particularly hard to cover because of the precision and all that speedy alternate picking and chugging. Well, gave my best, working on it and wish to perfect it someday.

The song is one of my favourite exciter songs and underrated, just like the album, the band, the scene, the genre and every single musician in the band. Bass mostly follows the guitars and relatively simple in comparison to other exciter songs. Carries the motorhead like rhythm throughout and takes a U-turn into blazing alternate picking with thunderous double bass drums. Amazing solos as well.

The challenge for me, again was the fast alternate picking and had to mix the song to increase the drums, as is the challenge in most of the 80s speed and thrash metal songs. Important here is syncing the tempo of the song in your head. 

Original Bassist - John Ricci
Genre - Speed Metal
From the album 'Violence And Force'

"Ok. So last Wednesday I was at an open mic and jam I frequent and after my set this one lady who was there and seems to be a friend of the MC/host of the open mic approached me about playing at a faire in the city. 

I said I was down and gave her my card. In my eagerness, I didn't ask about compensation initially and when I inquired about it over email later and she confirmed it was unpaid or ""about exposure"" as she put it ( I know, yuck), that I shouldn't bring a tip jar and that I'd be granted a pin that would give me entry to this festival for the entire week as well as a wristband for a guest and get free parking on the days I was playing.  She also sent a PDF with the address, some phone numbers, what was expected and what equipment they would have available. 

Looking back it was obvious why she was asking randoms last minute. At the time it just seemed like a good opportunity. 

Anywho, at that point I felt I had already committed, and that I should keep my word. And in my mind, it's not like I'm getting ABSOLUTELY nothing from it. Just no cash. I did end up putting a hat I brought with me at my feet incase somebody wanted to give me a totally unsolicited gift, tho. 
 

I played the first set I agreed to earlier today, and I have another scheduled for Sunday. I'm not dissapointed in my performance. And a lot of folks liked what I do, but I feel a little dirty.  Like I let my local music communtiy down as well as myself by doing this. 

It do seem to have a bit of an out however. They didn't actually have all the stuff they said they would. The pdf said they'd have three 1/4 guitar cables but they had none, so I performed mic'd. That's fine and all, it's not like I've never done it before, but they didn't hold up their end of the deal in this regard. Most of the other equipment was in a sorry state as well, but that's OK. At least they had a PA system. 

What do you guys think I should do?

I think accepting this gig was wrong, in my opinion, but I don't know what the right move going forward is. I feel like any choice I make as of rn is somewhat justified, but I don't know which is best. I don't think these folks are ill intentioned and I don't want to screw them. Many of the staff were very helpful.  But, I  also don't want them to make a habit out of trying to get free performances from people.

"In college my buddy and I took a music performance class taught by a well-respected jazz reed player. For an assignment we wrote and performed an acoustic guitar duo instrumental piece, and during the performance we were kind of moving our bodies and grooving to the rhythm. The instructor criticized this and pointed out in front of the rest of the class that what we were doing was an unnecessary, fake and ‚Äúmasturbatory‚Äù thing done primarily to convince an audience that you are special and gifted and are ‚Äúfeeling the music.‚Äù

I was kinda embarrassed after that and the situation affected me. I adopted a more stoic stage presence and tried to minimize my guitar face, modeling the professionalism of classical musicians. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd was my model of how this restraint could be shown in a rock music context.

I became judgmental of musicians who display this behavior, even if I liked their music. John Mayer was a good example for me of a talented musician who I unfortunately got second-hand embarrassment watching his head-bobbing and O-face.

I am now trying hard to reserve judgment when others express themselves that way as long as it is done genuinely and authentically.

What do others think? Is this behavior self-serving and done only for show? When you see musicians doing this what emotions and feelings does it invoke in you? Does it make you believe they have an extra special connection to music? Conversely, does the image of a stoic musician somehow diminish their impact for you?"

"I‚Äôm a singer and songwriter and I auditioned for a band a month ago, they said they were so happy and very keen with me they were absolutely amazed with my performance.
They said that they wanted to add me in the band and in the group chat of the band.
Then the next day they said that they actually have three more people to audition that they said they addition before meeting me in Person .
So I said, yeah, that‚Äôs fine even though in my head I‚Äôm like well if you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm in the band then why is it different now? But I just went along with it. 
They had to delay the Singer audition twice
First time is a week and the second time it‚Äôs just by a few days, but it‚Äôs just dragging along so much and I asked my sister for advice and what to reply to this and she said to say no to the band because it‚Äôs not fair that they‚Äôre stringing me along for this singer that they‚Äôre finding a difficult date to audition her for.
I don‚Äôt really know what to do in the situation because I do deserve some self-respect as I know my worth but also I really like this band."

"making music is amazing and streams atm are not my priority. But it still is and feels nice that you know people like your music in terms of streams and exposure.

2. play live and tour n stuff

"Just wanted to rant for a moment because this is 100% a ""problem"" that can only be solved on my own because everybody is different and has different goals in music and I need to figure out what mine actually are, but maybe I can get some inspiration here.

I am by no means an expert at playing anything, I am completely self taught and wouldn't even consider myself intermediate level at any single instrument, but I want to be proficient in playing them and I want to actually improve all the time. For the life of me though, I just cannot commit to just one of them. I'm fully aware that all of the time I spend on each one, (keyboard/synth, guitar, and tenor sax), is time that could be spent focusing on just one of them and actually seeing real improvement. 

But I can't help myself, life feels too short to only experience a single way to play music and I just don't feel too strong of a pull towards one more than the others. They're all fun and rewarding in their own unique ways! At the same time though I don't like the feeling like I'm just noodling around with three instruments and not seeing progress on any of them. In my hubris I convinced myself I could see steady improvement on all three if I stuck to a consistent schedule with them, but life finds a way to ruin your plans really quickly Ive found, making both time and energy really precious commodities.

If there was one I had the most experience with, it would be keyboard, and should probably be the one to focus on more because it's so much more intuitive in general and will give me the most applicable skills to apply to the others (not to mention that I actually play synth for two bands at the moment so that should be enough motivation right there, you'd think...) But I get bored with practicing a single instrument so quickly some days that I find myself rotating around all 3 in a single practice session. 

Can anybody else relate to this?? Are there any aspiring/successful multi-instrumentists that can share their experience or wisdom on this? Even anyone that specializes in a single instrument and why they feel such a draw to that one in particular? I am really curious about your experiences learning and performing music.



EDIT: Reading through everyone's anecdotes and stories is so cool and is really helping me contextualize my own journey with learning music. I think I have a pretty good grasp on how I want to go forward with it all now. Thank you everyone!"

"Hi,

So, everything is in the title. 
I''m currently running a DnD campaign and I wanted to use a piece as a theme song for the main antagonist. It's the Prelude in c sharp minor by Rachmaninoff, but transcripted for the organ.

I've found a couple of video online but this is a piece I really really like on a personnal level and turns out, I'm not satisfied with either of those interpretations. So, I was thinking, maybe I can commission an organist to play it and record it for me ? Is it even a reasonable demand to make ? What would be a correct budget for it ?

I have no idea where to look, so I just thought of Reddit as a start. "

"I played Clarinet for years and I travel a lot, plus I'm a circus performer. I've been interested in picking up a woodwind (but open to brass/string) that's very portable (like fits in a large coat pocket type portable), doesn't require much maintenance, but also has some range on it. I was thinking of recorder, but I haven't seen any videos really selling me on it and it has a pretty strong connotation of being a beginner/school kid instrument, which I know is more so just being cheap and easy to give to a kid. That led me to the tin whistle, but it seems very limited, which is a negative effect most small/portable instruments suffer from. 

I would like to avoid instruments with reeds that aren't built in, like the xaphoon, for example, or need electricity/batteries. I would prefer a whistle type mouthpiece, but I'm potentially open to something you traditionally see with flutes if it grabs my attention. I'd also like it to have pretty good range on the type of music it can play, which I know will also vary based on the music itself (trad/folk music from various parts of the world ex: Irish, Japanese, Native Am, etc). 

I even looked at non-woodwind like the pocket trumpet, but it seems to be unpopular due to poor construction, or the pocket violin, but would take a loooot more practice (but I'm comparing that to why I never learned my violin as an adult, because of the time investment just to get to mediocre). I do already have a kalimba which I dabble with, but lacks the range in types of music it can sound like. 

I know that greatly limits my options, but curious if I'm missing something after looking over recorder, tin whistle, pan pipes, quena, native flute, venova, ocarina, harmonica, jaw harp, and more. I'm probably leaning towards tin whistle, because the cost, ease of use, and portability greatly outweigh the con of its limits, but curious if there was something that might fit what I'm looking for better. 

I appreciate the suggestions and looking forward to researching what's mentioned. Thanks! "

"Hello, Im currently a sophmore in high school that wants to make a some sort of job out of music. 

I've done band and theater my whole life and have gotten into sound production for shows at a local community theater. I have been doing sound production for 3 years now and was thinking of trying to make a some sort of living out of it. I love singing and peforming live and I want to try to mix that with sound production skills to make music.

My quesiton is how?

I have very good grades and will being getting a scholarship that will pay for my tution in full for any college in my state (FL). I don't want to waste the oppurnity of this free tution but I also want to try to make a carrer in music and don't know how helpful college will be.

Should I move to a bigger city and try to work some sort of job to get by while trying to get my music carrer started on the side?

"I used to gig with someone and it was getting rough. He wouldn't make setlists and take long pauses between songs deciding what to do. He'd spring new songs on us at the gig, expecting us to follow along. He wouldn't play in time or listen to the rhythm section. 

Even though I enjoyed playing out it was draining and I also worried it would reflect poorly on me. I'm not perfect but I recognize when I mess up and practice. He didn't seem to do this and actually would get annoyed we didn't know the songs he had just come up with. So I stopped playing. 

He's reached out about playing again. Apparently he's had trouble finding backing musicians, so I feel bad. But I am wary of being in more bad shows. 

How would you proceed? Just say no? Try to be clear about expectations (like a setlist)? "
"So my band and I have gotten back together after a few years apart, and are releasing new music soon and were set to play a show to promote the new tunes. The day after our first post about it, the club emails us and says they‚Äôve been informed about allegations against my band mate, and will no longer be allowing our band to play. I was blindsided, I had no clue about any of this. My band mate informs me that a few years ago, while he was involved in another group, that he was having sex with a woman who had a boyfriend. The boyfriend found out one way or another, and my band mate claims that to save face, she accused him of assault. The rest of the group took her side, and he resigned his position. 

Now I‚Äôve known this dude half my life. I just can‚Äôt fathom him doing anything remotely related to sexual assault, but I also struggle with accepting that someone would lie about something so serious, although I know that‚Äôs happened. There‚Äôs no evidence in either direction other than the word of both parties, and I‚Äôm still vague on some things, including the exact nature of the allegations. But now I‚Äôm in the unenviable position of either believing my friend and appearing to be an apologist for abuse to at least some group of people, or terminating his role despite his possible innocence. Has anyone been through something similar, or just have any advice for me? Thanks

EDIT: just to add some details, there was never any police involvement, and he‚Äôs claiming they had multiple sexual encounters, and that she was living with the boyfriend at his parents house during all this. "

I'm self taught at pretty much every instrument that I play, this one in particular is an acoustic guitar. So the chords that I got out of the melody for an intro is EM7 then Ebm7 then C#m7, and the stanza just goes EM7 and C#m7 twice.

"Hey y'all, how are you?

So, in an attempt to help algorithms better understand my own songs and those of other talented musicians I've discovered here on Reddit, I'm creating playlists from time to time featuring bands that complement each other (folk, indie pop, dream pop, indie rock, shoegaze, and all kinds of dreamy vibes). The main goal is to have the algorithm recommend our songs.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone's interested, please DM me with Spotify links to your songs and a bit about yourself/your band (if they fit the project). Also, send a screenshot showing that you've saved the playlist. I'll disregard anyone who just dumps links without any context of their work or doesn't follow the guidelines for promotion.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this will only be effective if people also share and listen to the other bands. Engaging, liking, and commenting on their music also helps establish a connection to the algorithm between their sound and yours. So, if you could check out the bands from this playlist and, if you like any, show them some support! Let's grow together!

I'm not an expert at this, so any suggestions are also welcome!

Started singing, and came to love it. Got hired by another church to play lead guitar. Joined a country band from Craigslist. Band broke up after 1 gig.

Now I'm front-man for a 90s rock cover band, 'Abercrombie &amp; B\*tch'. Spent 5 months finding (and replacing) members, building set list. Had our first ""show"" a couple weeks ago at a friend's backyard. Rented pro PA equiment, had about 60 friends and family come, it was a blast. Took a little video: [https://youtu.be/j4e5sGKaMBw](https://youtu.be/j4e5sGKaMBw)

Today I submitted inquiries to 7 venues in town that I think would be a good fit. Not expecting much, but I'll follow up if I don't hear anything. Any advice or encouragement along the way would be most welcome :)

I‚Äôm a drummer in an indie/emo/altertnative ish band. We‚Äôve been putting on quite a few free shows at one of our band members houses. We haven‚Äôt done many shows where we charge. One of the reasons is they don‚Äôt want to charge their friends. I think we should put value to what we do and our real friends will support us by paying $2. You can‚Äôt even get a meal at McDonald‚Äôs for $2. A lot of our shows where we have had people have to pay to see us, there‚Äôs been a big chunk of their friends who ask if they could get sneaked in, and the band members have complied. I really disagree with this. What can I say to convince them without sounding like a dad? I‚Äôm older than all of them by about 6-7 years "

"Hi all!! I know this has probably been asked a billion times but here goes nothing.

"Hey, I hope this is the right subreddit for my question :)



About 2 weeks ago a content producer of a (serious) sync library emailed me saying he liked my tracks but asked me if I could make binaural mixes of them because they feel a bit ""centered"", I replied saying of course and that it might take a few days, he was fine with it and even texted that he was excited about the results. About 2-3 days later I sent him the binaural mixes and since then he hasn't replied... it's been over 9 days now and still no reply, I emailed him last Thursday to ask him if he had received my last email, no reply of course... I don't know, it's so weird to me and I can't imagine that my mixes are so horrible that he would ghost me.



Is that normal in this business? I'm pretty new to the sync licensing business."

For me it's a scheduling issue. I'm pretty busy, so I just don't want to set aside extra time to talk about playing instead of just playing. It also often means we'll never end up getting together, as it adds an extra layer of complication in front of just playing music."

"Not sure if you guys have any advice on this, but I started working as a part-time, self-employed private guitar teacher this year. Been reading up on tax stuff like deductibles and depreciations and I'm wondering what kinds of capital expense items I can claim without being audited.

I've been using a super old computer (for virtual lessons) and a budget guitar so far, and was already considering upgrading them. If I get a new computer ($800-1200 range) and/or a new guitar ($600-1000), would I be able to claim these for depreciation? If they are cheaper, does it reduce the chance of being audited?

Also, are there places on the tax form to write comments for each expense, so I can explain (if that helps)? Never done self employed taxes before.

"Being a full-time music student, I know some basic music reading and some music theory. I have been playing music since I was a young teenager, but didn't learn all of the other stuff until about a year ago. I keep worrying about not understanding it. Some of this stuff is hard to grasp, like how major and minor chords on guitar are different if you have root on E string and when you have the root on the A string for example. Maybe I'm thinking too hard about it. How long does it take a person to really learn and understand music theory? Maybe I need to hear it as well to understand it?

I am autistic, so I like a linear thought process...A is the note, the chord is formed from these intervals, etc. etc. Maybe I just need to watch a few YouTube videos before I grasp it? How long did it take y'all to get music theory and really, truly understand it and how it works? I look at all these things sometimes and my autistic mind is overwhelmed with information and I freak out."

"Most common lie new potential band mates say when you first talk to them before playing with them?

I hear a lot, ‚ÄúI play it like the record‚Äù

"My bandmates and I are moving into a new house in May and wanted to use the basement to practice and potentially host house shows.  We wanted these shows to be focused on people having a good time listening to the music and not getting wasted (like some other house venues in town promote) so we'd plan on trying to draw a pretty tame and respectful crowd.  Recently we learned that our next-door neighbor is a grumpy old lady who has harassed bands who have lived in the house in the past.  These bands used the basement for a practice space and she would yell at them to be quiet, spewing falsities such as lying about the way the noise ordinance works in town.  She would also threaten to call the band's parents (ok??), the landlord (they don't care), and the cops (the only group I am worried about).  I think we should be able to practice without much trouble but we are unsure about the house show thing now.  According to the band who lives at the house now this neighbor has never called the police on them but they have also never hosted shows there.  Generally, the cops in town are not assholes about house shows so I'm not sure there would be much of an issue but I'd still like to avoid it.  One other thing I should add is that this neighbor technically does trespass into the backyard to bang on the windows of the basement when bands have been practicing in the past."

 A few years back when i was making tons of music i got really friendly with some dude i met on a music production discord server. We started giving each other feedback and then i mustve sent him over 20 demos. And then at one point, his music was like suspiciously good and i realized he was literally sending me music from ncs and was asking me to give feedback on it. I also somehow didnt realize this but on his youtube channel back then(he deleted everything now i just checked) his songs were content ID by small artists! I even asked him about it lol but he just said ""idk people hate me."" 

I just realized that he couldve stolen some of my work or something after i came across some reddit posts of very similar things. Its been like 4 years since and like im getting back into music quite a bit again, and i wanna finish some of these unreleased songs. You guys think if he ripped some of my melodies or music and released it or sold it somewhere, I would still be protected by copyright laws(from Canada btw)?

Would anyone even be interested in that, and if so, is it saleable? Just putting the feelers out on it right now. 
Both sheets are VERY user friendly, only requiring you to enter in your info (ie, gig info, sales made, etc.).

"Before I stopped, I was a lifelong player of music. Bass and Bari Sax. Got eaten alive by college and the job market after, tried several bands afterwards that would go from 6 months to a year of nothing but accolades (top 40 classic rock/ RnB hits, 60s/70s Ska, proto punk like Johnny Thunders, etc).

Rock/punk bands were longer, bitchier projects; always a conflict over whatever could be identified as out of order. A few bands went over years that never returned on the time invested. 

I severely lost interest in music when I had a friend reveal that he was essentially poisoning the well of friends that we both shared in music. This after we more or less got scammed bait and switch style by a singer's ambitions to get laid with someone who more or less had her own musical ambitions that hijacked ours. Long story. 

I've always thought of myself as original, but when most people all the way from family to (what you know as) friends convey all your ideas are garbage, it's better to just assimilate to someone else's agenda, enjoy being the tool, you'll go places, it rips all connection I have with music out. 

I love music when I think it's appreciated. But my experience has been you're only valued so long as you fuel someone else's show. 

How do you put aside all the ""shit"" that you deal with trying to relate to people? I look back on a lot of what I dealt with, and despite getting a DAW and audio interface I just feel disconnected.

Recently we got a new drummer. He hasn't played for a few years and is a bit rusty. Especially when it comes to staying tight and on time.

We usually play with a click in our IEMs to make sure everyone is on time. This drummer, however, gets too excited playing and does not follow the click very well. The tempo is off.

What should we do when we perform? Should we just continue to follow the click or try to keep up with the drummers fluctuating tempo?"
"Hi guys, let me know some marketing ideas for boosting my Spotify reach?

"I've listened to a lot of amateur producers, and mid-level producers.  And while many of them are great, 95% of solo projects have a similar vibe.  Elevator music is the absolutely the wrong concept, but it's more robotic, it's not as organic, and it's hitting things exactly when it needs to be hit and it attacks you.

When you have musicians, and even producers, that take the time to give each sound it's own journey into the open space of that music, it's just distinctly different.  As opposed to someone just layering things over and over with ""that sounds great"" as the leading idea.

I'm probably in my head about this, though.  I know there's tons of nuance.

"Hey guys, I'm new to this subreddit and I'd like to ask a question to real musicians. 

I'm in late 20s, an instrumentalist(i play drums) and going to be a student at music uni. But recently I have big doubt about my dream. 

In my teenager time although I enjoyed listening music, I never thought to be a musician or make my own music. I started this thing just bc musicians seemed so cool and I wanted to be like them.
Practicing was fine. I liked making my skills better. BUT when I realize I can't do music alone, things started going worse. When I play with others, I feel somehow wrong. I always feel anxiety about I may ruin this so I can't enjoy that time and usually lack of confidence. Is this normal? I guess maybe it is because I've never been in school band or gig with friends. my only experience playing with others is ensemble class at academy. But still...

Also, I feel like I don't like listening to music much. I too easily get tired when I listen to any kind of music. I prefer to do other things rather than listening music in my free time. This is getting worse recently, but I think it's been like this since long ago.

I feel like I'm not going to handle this if I go to uni as I am now. I assume all students at there LOVE music and I know I don't. Tuition fees are expensive and I'm not sure this is worth trying. 

Am I burn out or is this really not my aptitude? Has anyone been the same situation like I am now? I look forward any kind of advice. Thank you."

"Hey everyone,

I know someone out there has experienced this and hopefully found a solution that I haven‚Äôt tried yet.

I have been releasing music for over a year now. Every time I release a new single, my monthly listeners skyrocket and the song is getting consistent attention. 

Within 1 month, my 24hr streams decrease to half they were the first couple weeks. But I never change my promotion strategy. I know this is a sign of people not liking the song and moving on, but if that was the case, I wouldn‚Äôt have a 10% playlist add rate. Right?

I use submithub, social media, and the Spotify algorithm to get my music heard. Ive never had a TikTok reach over 1k views in my career and I post almost every day. 

I know this may sound crazy, but I know some people who mention that deleting and remaking a different TikTok account may give you more luck and a fresh start. It seems like no matter the content, hashtags, sounds or length of my videos, they don‚Äôt get past 0 views majority of the time.

Anyone have any other suggestions to promote my music in any other ways? I feel like I can implement them and it will hopefully give me some long term listeners to develop my fan base. What am I missing?

I make rap if it helps with any ideas."

"Hi! I've been creating music for about 20 years. I've recently lost my non-music related full-time job, and am taking this time to find a new project where I can combine my passion (music) with what I most liked about my career (data). 

My musical process is mainly driven by my own personal tastes, intuitions, and creativity (what makes me me). Simultaneously, I am inevitably influenced by the songs and artists that I like the most or that are most successful in my chosen genres. For the latter, I often self-study by active listening and analysis or by consuming videos or data to understand what makes that music great, impactful, and palatable for the audience in these genres. I like understanding, musically, *why* we like it so much. 

I would like to build a project that allows musicians to easily access and understand data related to successful music and its attributes, such as tempos, key signatures, chord progressions, song lengths, themes, and instruments used. The data would be compiled and accessible to understand what current successful songs have in common on a broader scale, to help us, as musicians, be more successful by 1) adapting to trends or 2) differentiating ourselves from trends to help us stand out. 

The purpose of this project is not to encourage artists to ""sell out,"" but rather to leverage data to help us become successful. Just like any other industry, it's important to understand the market we're part of in order to achieve sustainable success, and that's my ultimate aim: helping educate and inform the creative process with data to help us live out our dreams.

I've put together a quick, anonymous survey and would be appreciative of anyone that would like to collaborate. Thank you so much in advance!

"Hi,

So the other day I get a DM from a individual in my Instagram. Stating that he really liked my music and that he wrote for a relatively big music blog/editorial. We then were talking about music in general for the last two days and about life etc. I ended up asking him how he found my music as I am a really small artist (15 monthly listeners) he ended up saying him and a team were looking for small prospects of distrokids ""slaps"" which tracks as I do put stuff on there. And the conversation was relatively normal asking about my writing process, influences etc and then they ask if I have ever been written about or would like to be? I ask them what they mean and get this response. Which when life says something is too good to be true I get weirded out but I have no idea how to check if they are legit. I can look them up and find their twitter, and their LinkedIn but don't know how I can figure out if this is real. Any advice?"

"Hi there,

A bit of context: I joined a blues rock band over a year ago as a singer. It's a group of four friends from the same village, all in their forties, and I'm the newcomer, the youngest, the girl... 
I got back into music after a long break and I really clicked with the atmosphere. We don't have any ambitions other than having fun. At first, I was finding my groove, no problem, but the more we progress, the more I feel limited.

Well, they're not great musicians, they know it, but I don't hold it against them; playing for fun is also good, and I have another more serious project on the side. I won't dwell on all the problems, because ultimately, they'd probably all be solved if we had a decent drummer.

But our drummer is a nightmare. Can't keep the beat, gets lost in the songs, and is very (very) limited technically. It's awful. I've put in a lot of effort to help him improve, but everything I try fails.

I know that without him, everything would be better, and in fact, I took advantage of a day when he wasn't there to suggest to the others to play along with a drum machine. They played better than ever and they noticed it. 
But here's the thing: as bad as our drummer may be, he's also a good guy. And especially, he's the mega buddy of the two guitarists. So, I don't come out as a winner if there's ever an open ""conflict"" except that...

...They've also all noticed that I push them to do better. Let's say that my outsider perspective encourages them to challenge themselves more than they did before, just among friends... And I can see that they feel inspired to try more complicated things. They would definitely be capable of it with another drummer, once again.

So, the question is:
How do I convince them to say goodbye to the drummer?
Or from your experiences, is it a lost cause, and should I leave the ship or keep my mouth shut? (Which would be ironic for a singer...).

"Hello all, my name is Gideon, I stream music live on twitch. I am struggling to overcome tech issues using OBS, a USB controller, and FL studio. My first issue is the default audio driver is very weak, offering poor midi latency and often craps out on me. There is a better audio driver (ASIO) but it doesn't play nice with other software and shuts down audio from all other applications. I plan on buying an audio interface then running the audio output from the DAW to it, then back to the computer as I've heard it has a built in audio driver (or a sound card? Still learning all this stuff). Secondly, OBS has an audio mixer built in to master all the volume levels (vocals from your mic, audio output from the DAW, audio from other applications) and it's garbage. It's okay for playing video games or just talking but it's not designed for music.  I have no way of listening back to my final mix live (what my viewers) hear, so when I watch  my VODS back sometimes my vocals are drowned out by the instruments. Any advice?"

"As the title says, where do you guys go besides CL to find bandmates.  My band has had an ad up for like 6 months.  We're established and have our own studio recorded originals.  People seem to like our music.  We've played around town and looking to expand.   We're basically a turn key solution for a singer that wants to join a band but 90% of the replies we get eventually just ghost us.  I expect a certain amount of that but not after we've met and texted/talked back and forth.  

I've thought that maybe we're sending red flags somehow but I don't think that's it.  We're all responsible adults, some with kids etc...

"Hello, talented humans! I‚Äôm seeking recommendations and advice for how to encourage my 4 year old (soon to be 5) kid who loves music and has an obvious natural talent for it.

He was playing drums at 10 mos and strummin on the Loog by 2. At 4, he makes up his own songs with advanced rhyme schemes, impressive timing, and hilarious story arcs. He knows genres by ear and is able to name musicians he knows by hearing any song from their discography. (played some jazz one morning &amp; he goes ‚ÄúJazz musician‚Äôs name again?!‚Äù Haha)  His father &amp; I are decently smart folks but this kid is blowing our minds. We aren‚Äôt the type to toss around the word genius but we do want to do everything we can to help flourish whatever musical talent that is clearly waiting to come out. 

His birthday is right around the corner and we would like to get a few things to set him up to explore his sonic youth. (Corny, I know) Does anyone know of any good kid‚Äôs pianos that have teaching apps? We may buy another Loog cause he smashed the other one like a lil rock star (in reality, he was just too young to have one at the time). Does anyone have any youtube/online music learning channels/classes? Is a drum/midi/synth controller/pad a good idea? He loves the stylophone, is there a larger/louder version that is kid friendly? We don‚Äôt want to break the bank but we do want to invest in something he obviously loves.

Also, how do we do our best to encourage him to continue exploring? We don‚Äôt live in a town with a lot of live shows and the ones that are here happen to be kind of one note (lots of blue grass &amp; country). Is 4/5 too young to start trekking outside our area to go to live shows and concerts?

"How the fuck do you get to do it? 

I got myself a remote job so I could focus on random shit I love when projects aren‚Äôt heavy. I used to tour in my twenties but it wasn‚Äôt sustainable. I settled down‚Äîfocused on a safe career that made money.  That wasn‚Äôt to say that every time I saw a live band I didn‚Äôt kick myself for not putting in the work to bring up there onstage. 

In fact as a dropout in high school and then finishing that, dropping out of college ‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt make music a focus in my life until I could support myself. For anyone who grew up poor and with no safety net‚Äîyou probably get it. But with that I didn‚Äôt surround myself with people who let me live in that world. 

I really do stereotypically believe music IS my life and as a performer all my life I wish I had people around me to jam with. 

Every musician who I hooked up with just didn‚Äôt feel that magic with me and I never played music with someone I was dating. There‚Äôs a huge part of me that wishes I did have that type of love but alas, life goes on‚ÄîI got married and had a kid. 

Then out of performing again I‚Äôve been asked to play and do backup vocals with a really amazing local band that does my genre and style. It‚Äôs honestly really nice even if no one in that band is within +/- 7 years of my age.  (I‚Äôm really grateful to find an opportunity like this late in life because the musician community I grew up around lived ate and breathed it but I could never be that brave.) 

And now in the age of doom scrolling whenever I see advice to do the thing you love so your tribe can find you playing music resonates louder than ever.

"I‚Äôve been learning guitar (and drums) for the last 6 months and something I struggle with mentally is how late I started. I had a decent home life as a kid but I was never encouraged to explore my own interests so I didn‚Äôt seriously pick up guitar until 22. I learned maybe 2 simple songs previously but that‚Äôs it.

Now at 22, I‚Äôm realizing that being a career musician is always what I‚Äôve wanted, but being behind my peers who started young I feel like I‚Äôm at a disadvantage to achieve the level of greatness required to be a successful musician. 

I‚Äôve always had an ear for music and singing but I didn‚Äôt capitalize on it in my teens and I sort of regret it. My folks pushed me down the STEM track and only now do I realize it‚Äôs not my gig.

I‚Äôve been on a certain track for years because it‚Äôs what my parents wanted and now I have to make this change in order to be happy and I need a lot more experience to make it work. Ik a guy who started touring at 18 and I‚Äôm not even ready to think about touring! Some people start younger, are excellent players, but still take them a decade to be financially successful. I just have no idea how I‚Äôm gonna make it work when most serious musicians are well on their way by now. 

I guess I recognize the benefit of starting young and sticking to something. Now I‚Äôm sweating practicing a couple hours a day trying to ‚Äòcatch up.‚Äô Nobody believes I‚Äôm serious when I say this is what I want, because they think I‚Äôm just gonna drop it within a year, which is also discouraging, but motivating too. 

The angst really gets to me at times, and I‚Äôm not sure what to do like I need a mentor or something.

"Hi, everyone. Recently, I've had some doubts of my skills as a composer, particularly, when working with others. I keep getting hired to create soundtracks for video games, and I put my heart and soul into making them sound as good as possible, but the client nearly always either seems unbothered by the quality, or doesn't like it - this isnt one or two, this is majority of them. I'm confused though, since there's always a smaller portion of others that say they love it, and I always got good marks for my music at school. This confusion is really making me feel burned out, and very imposter syndrome-y. I don't know how I'll ever know if I am good enough if my reviews are always so mixed"
"Hello, I am currently a violinist deciding between the Royal College of Music and the Hannover school of music, media and theater for my undergraduate degree.

For the royal college of music, I've chosen my professor to be Ani Schnarch, and for the Hannover school, Elisabeth Kufferath. I think their way of teaching is great, albeit different in some ways. But I think if I were to study with one of them, I'd most likely be okay with either.

Right now, I'm totally at a loss in decision between these schools. On one hand, I'm afraid I won't be able to communicate with the German students in Hannover and make friends, as I've only learned German for half a year and am barely at B1 level. On the other, I'm not sure what the environment is like in RCM, as I heard from my cousin at RAM that some students aren't given enough attention due to favoritism or something like that. (I don't mean to offend RCM students, as I'm just copying what he said.)

  
Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you. "
"So, I have a pretty common name, and I release music under my own name. It doesn't conform to a specific genre--pop/folk/rock/classical/jazz/soundtrack is the only way to describe it.

To differentiate myself from the zillion other people with my name, I include a middle name. Trouble is, it feels a little stodgy and square, maybe even pretentious, and that's not the vibe I'm going for. It might cause people to not want to listen to it. (It's not that I'm trying to become famous. That ship has sailed, but I'd like to have a little more exposure--who doesn't? I don't gig, so I'm pretty much totally obscure)

Another option--come up with a ""band name"" that is unique and cool (easier said than done). Pros--maybe more people would want to hear my shit. Cons--what about everything I've already released under my own name? It's on all the streaming platforms. Will it be forgotten? Could the potential two names somehow be linked? And could it also be considered pretentious to use a fake name? 

Compare classical music (pretty much 100% using actual names), soundtracks (99% actual names), country (‚âà95% actual names), jazz (‚âà 90% actual names) to pop/rock (maybe 35/65 in favor of stage names).

My stuff takes elements of all the above, so I don't have that to use as a guideline. Anyone have any strong feelings either way?

"Hi there everyone,

I am part of a small startup trying to make a platform that makes it easier for newer, independent artists to grow their fan base and get more listens for their music by offering a marketplace of vetted (guaranteed no bots), more established artists (1,000+ and can go as high as 100,000+ fan base) where you can pay for Features and Promotions from the established artist.

Thanks!

Anticipated Platform Highlights:

* Vetted Artists: Access a selection of handpicked artists by genre, guaranteed bot-free with 1,000+ fans and ranging up to 100,000+. Choose based on your budget.
* Customized Options: View artist profiles for effectiveness ratings, music compatibility, social promotion offerings, availability, pricing, and their average response times (or even schedule a Feature).
* Playlist Integrity Monitoring: Our service will actively monitor releases to identify and flag botted playlists, ensuring your music reaches real listeners. Plus, we handle all communications with platforms like Spotify to maintain the integrity of your music's performance.
* Secure Transactions: Funds and products are held until all parties have met the agreement terms.
* Growth Guarantee: If there's no growth, we refund our commission. You only pay the artist for their work.
* Transparent Ratings: See actual growth rates and successful song features for each artist so you can make informed decisions.

Area we are interested in exploring:

* What are your biggest concerns?
* What are your biggest pain points as far as getting more listens, as an artist?
* What are your biggest objections for a product like this?
* For those of you that have already paid for a Feature before, what were the most time-consuming/annoying parts of the process?
* Issues/complaints about the colors, font, etc.

How much is our commission? How much do Features cost?

TLDR; 10% for our commission (though it's zero if you get no benefit). Features in the industry currently run $200-$500+ (plus commission).

Presently many agencies offer a similar service, but they do so for hundreds to thousands on top of the artist's fee. We're hoping to change this and make this great growth method much more accessible (and streamlined).

Growing as an artist and getting ears on your product so you can grow a dedicated fan base shouldn't be as hard as it currently is. We're looking to change that.

**Summary:**¬†We‚Äôre keen to align our services with artists' needs and avoid any community guideline violations, so we won't post our website link here. If interested, drop a comment with your¬†**genre**, and we‚Äôll reach out with a link. We're rolling out based on genre demand‚Äîso your genre will help us know which genres to roll out to first. This is our second time posting about this, we got taken down before for posting the link."

"Soo I'm 33 years old. Ive loved performing and  been writing music all my life but I've always been too anxious to actually sing (even though that was my dream to sing in a rock band).

Ive loved all types of different singing styles over the years, but I want to rock so bad. I thought I had a voice for it but something didn't feel right.

I finally started vocal lessons a few years ago and Ive been practicing and listening to myself sing all types of different styles. But the one that feels the most comfortable for me is folk music üò≠.

I know all I have to do is write folk rock but I'm just pissed off that my voice is meant for that and I'm not made for harsh strong sounds that rock needs. I have a strong powerful sound but it only works properly with the ups and downs folk has and I'm unhappy about it.

Do any other singers have this? Or any one have any advice?

Edit: OK the response from the community here has been incredibly supportive and positive with a lot of good advice. I'm sorry I can't respond to all of you (I don't have the time to type out everything I would want to sayüòÖ). Let me just sum it up and say thank you to everyone! I wasn't expecting anyone to get back to me let alone all of you and so quickly. I'll talk all of your advice and focus on what I can do.

"Buzzing on live sound, potential grounding issue? How to fix?

At my gig earlier today, I have 4 speakers daisy chained and the last one is experiencing buzzing on the live audio, but not on recorded audio. Low volume gig, playing background music for ambiance enhancement. My set up is:

Power
At a convention hall. No wall outlet. Extension cord &gt; power strip &gt; 2 pedals, 3 amps, 1 extension cord to last amp in daisy chain.  for main power. I have the last speaker which is a CoolMusic BP60D (edit: oops, listed this in reverse)

Audio
Instrument &gt; pedals &gt; Eon One MK2 &gt; Eon One MK2 &gt; CoolMusic BP60D amp on stand &gt; Cool Music BP60D on floor (grass/sod) as monitor.

Have switched all cables around, does not resolve buzzing. When the BP60D is unplugged running on its internal battery I'm not hearing a buzz. Buzz exists when volume is on. No buzz when volume is off. 

See pic for set up. A buddy suggested it was a grounding issue and to ditch the power strips. But I don't want to run on battery when I don't have to. I cannot plug in directly to power.

Any ideas on a fix? It's mostly an annoyance. The buzz is not heard on the other 3 speakers that are used for ambiance enhancement, but it is very audible on my monitor. Thank you!"

"I don't have perfect pitch. I can't sing or name a note without a reference note. I can try to play a song in my head with perfect detail, but no matter how hard I focus it will always be in a completely random key.

But sometimes when I'm drifting off to sleep, or when I start daydreaming, a bit of a song will leak out of my subconscious and play in my head. Unlike when I actively recall a song, it will somehow *feel real*, almost like I heard it with my ears rather than my mind.

I downloaded a pitch tracking app out of curiosity. Whenever this happens, I hum what I heard into my phone to see what the notes are, and then I listen to the actual song to see how accurate I was. Most of the time, it's spot on! (Well, within a semitone at least.)

It seems like my brain has the absolute pitch of songs stored inside it somewhere, but I can't access them. They only slip out when I'm half dreaming, completely outside of my control.

I've never heard of something like this before, but I'm really curious. Is this a common thing? Does it have a name? Is it possible to use this to train myself to have perfect pitch?"

"   I did a mall gig playing piano last week and the mall staff kept telling me I was too loud, in stark contrast to every single customer walking by and store employees giving me thumbs up and encouraging comments. One customer was even present when the staff member told me to quiet down and actually told them off for me lol. I wouldn‚Äôt have been so direct myself. This is after I had closed the lid completely, used the soft pedal the whole time, and switched to soft easy listening music.
    
Seriously where to these people get off? It‚Äôs not the first time this has happened, it happens at restaurants too.
   
My dearest children, you set up a GRAND piano in an echo chamber, hired me after I sent in video clips and described clearly the kind of music that I play (Chopin, Liszt etc.), then complain about the noise? What do you want from me? Why waste money on a grand? Why waste money on my skills? Why have live music at all?
   
I know this is nothing new, but getting back into music after 10 years has made me much more aware of these things lately. The things we put up with for music.

Update: 
The mall manager who hired me responded. What she said: 
‚ÄúWhat? Who said it was too loud? I loved listening to your playing from my office! Some of the store managers want you to come back every day haha! I heard you drew quite the crowd too, we‚Äôd love to have you back. You won‚Äôt have to worry about volume, like I said I don‚Äôt know why you were told that. Let me know if you can!‚Äù

"Proof of being a metal heart. Coz accept are goddamn metal.

A simple, signature accept song, one of the crowd favourites. Surprisingly no one has covered it on bass on youtube, so I chose it.

Peter plays open E string with the rhythm in the main riff, mimicing guitars in the rest of the riffs. Simple yet complete.

No challenge, an easy one, prepared it in an hour. Figured out the tabs by ear and isolating the bass from the mix.

Genre - Heavy Metal

"Hey all, My name is Tozen and I've been making music for a while now. I released my first song in January 2024, and have been releasing consistently since.

I come to you today to share a dilemma I have run into. My following on socials and streaming platforms is very very small, and I don't have any friends in the music industry/pathway or even pursuing music as a hobby, so not really any connections either. 

I'm a solo guitarist that can play guitar to pretty much anything music related, since I've been playing guitar for a couple of years and have good music theory knowledge. I've made and released some of my own songs with guitar in them and REALLY love playing as a solo artist (a.k.a. the skill set is already achieved).

**The problem I have** is that I have never played a single live performance (other than my old high school's annual show) and really want to get myself out there and just enjoy performing for people live, but I have no idea how to even start the process. My town is a relatively small town outside of Atlanta called Johns Creek, and it doesn't really have a huge music scene. I don't even know about any open mics or jams in the area. Everything I have read online is telling me to:

* **Join a band** - but I don't think I have the time or overall commitment for that and enjoy being solo
* **Book a venue** - I have no idea how to get this process even started, and don't know about any in my area
* **Use any musical friend connections** - As I stated before, I'm not in contact with that many people, and none of them are in the music area
* **Use live performance experience** - I have none :( so I can't use that as a way to get anything
* **Play at local bars** - I have no idea if the type of music I'm going for is played in those places

I do plan on adding to my playable material and such while also doing cover songs from artists like **Masayoshi Takanaka** and some solo rock guitarists for these live performances.

If anyone wants a sample/example of my guitar playing or one of my songs, feel free to comment asking for that and I will gladly provide.

In this case, I am literally starting from 0, and don't know how to do anything related to live performances, other than the music itself.

Any help at all is GREATLY APPRECIATED (by me)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"A song of mine made it to the finals of a songwriting competition that gets a good bit of publicity - it's the only song I have out so far.

Should I drop a couple songs ASAP? The day of the event? A week later? Only one song for now and then more singles and an album later? My goals are to increase followers on social media and streaming platforms, increase streams on the one song that's out, and maybe get streams on a new release?

My initial thought was to drop an EP the day of the awards show and announce it at the show, but I've heard people don't really listen to EPs and it's best to do singles and then an album.

I'd love some guidance on what sort of release schedule might make the most of this opportunity. The song that's out is kinda Jack Johnson-esque. The other ones I have ready are folkish, indie rockish, and psych rockish, depending on the song. Thank you so much if you took the time to read all of this."

"Hi I‚Äôm 13 and I started playing guitar about a year ago and piano a couple months ago. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm at an amateur level on guitar, I‚Äôm not sure.

I think ai companies should be forced to pay artists that have had their music ripped for the sake of making an ai song. These ai models are just code and the code leaves an unbiased digital trail. Royalties can certainly be traced this way. The corporations need to be held accountable and the artists, who are unknowingly being used to help produce these songs, need to be compensated.

"Obviously there is a lot to unpack from the title, like you can get to work and make any band of your liking with anyone around you, what does it mean to be ""successful,"" isn't having fun all that matters, etc. But I'm sure the question is fair at face value.

I'm in Buffalo, NY. We definitely had some hits. Goo Goo Dolls, 10,000 Maniacs, Cannibal Corpse, Every Time I Die, Snapcase. Obv not every diy band is going to make it out of the rest, I would consider even 1/10th the success as the aforementioned bands as success. Even if there is great value to just being a part of a scene, whether or not your music lives or grows outside of local shows, I still feel like many people don't have the drive that I see in other cities and other scenes that get bands touring and eventually headlining.

There are the no-duh places out there like NYC, LA, Chicago, Philly. But also Richmond, Providence, Pittsburgh, San Antonio all seem to be much greater hubs to find people who are willing to be dropouts and live out a band and have fun. A lot of rust belt cities seem to enjoy the band stuff on the weekends as a night out but the drive really stops there. Idk. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like after my first band or two here I may well just pack my things and go to another scene where there is a better chance at finding people who want to give it their all."

"hello! im considering working on and releasing some artistic projects and while this may be a long reach, im thinking of how to gain peoples interest in my work without having to clout chase on instagram by commenting on famous peoples posts or posting every day or the like. 

i know the first step is to have good music, aka music im genuinely proud of but sometimes even good content doesnt get engagement if its hidden or if people just havebt built a connection to the person posting or so. but i also dont want to make myself seem too accessible to people so i dont want to be too casual and overshare in my posting on social media or make everyone feel like theyre my friend - i want to maintain a professional distance a) to make sure there are no problems later on down the line where i feel like i have to maintain all these people or have overly familiar listeners and b) make sure the people who like my work especially at the start like my work for the actual work itself and arent just engaging out of obligation or so

im sure i contradicted myself a couple of times but im just trying to loosely debate this in my head and thought doing so with some input could be insightful

maybe im not at a point where i should be worrying about things like professional distance and should just max out every sort of interaction or chance for someone to support me that i could get but idk i have faith that another way or even multiple routes are possible. also if youre a musician who lands gigs or considers yourself to have achieved some goals when it comes to listeners and wouldnt mind sharing how that worked for you please do! i'd appreciate hearing some evidence of how it can work out in non traditional (or traditional!) ways

"Hello! I need some advice from people in bands. Recently, my band has been going through some turmoil because I feel like my band members aren‚Äôt taking up the responsibilities of being in a band, but expecting to have their vision of what they want come true.

 I am the lead singer, I write all the lyrics, and most of the guitar, and bass parts. I also do all the art for merch and fliers and social media stuff, as well as our booking. Now you might be thinking I‚Äôm a control freak, and while I do have my own vision of what the band should be, I CONSTANTLY ask other members to take on some of these responsibilities or to give me meaningful feedback. I always either send mock ups of the art, conversations with organizers, or WIPs of the songs that I‚Äôm writing and ask what they think. And they either straight up don‚Äôt give me a response or give me vague critiques like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it‚Äù or my favorite ‚Äúmy opinion is nebulous‚Äù. I‚Äôve asked them to help me write riffs, make their own merch designs, or to help out with logistics ect. But then in return, they get upset with me when the output is not what they imagined or I make creative decisions on my own. And the few times that they have stepped up to do something they expect that what they make will absolutely not be criticized in any way. 

I told them that essentially I can‚Äôt read their mind, and if they want more of a say, they can take up more responsibilities and use clearer communication. But that was brushed under the rug, do I quit? Or do I figure something out."
"I have recently been contemplating going to trade school, as my current college is being defunded.

I also love to work with my hands, which makes it seem like an ideal career path for someone like me.

However‚Ä¶

Though it sounds ridiculous, the only thing keeping me from pursuing a trade is the fear of losing hand functionality due to a workplace accident; I would be so depressed if I lost the ability to play music. I have heard so many horror stories from electricians, carpenters, etc.

I‚Äôd like to hear some honest opinions from anyone who has gone the trade route while also pursuing music. Are there certain trades that are safer than others for musicians? Any recommendations or advice is greatly appreciated!

We went to go ask a bartender about getting paid for the show. There was a woman probably in her mid fifties that was staring at Me. I looked at her and nodded. She blew me a couple kisses and did that cat paw thing and made the noise associated with it. I immediately turned my head away.

"My threepiece band stumbled into a rather dissatisfying situation and I'd like to hear your advice and opinions. 
We've been booked as the band for a TED-talk in our hometown. When we agreed on this gig it's been said there was full technical service (FOH, mixer, PA, etc). No fixed payment but a tip jar plus a follow-up interview on the local radio show. This was months ago. 
Even though we've asked multiple times, it was only a couple of days before the gig until we got contacted by the ""sound guy"". That guy is actually a DJ and has little to no experience in mixing Bands, neither does he have a console, mics or anything else. 

Right now, it looks like we'll have to bring everything by ourselves except for the PA. We've discussed this within the band and decided we'll play the gig for tips, but we'll charge a flat fee for the technical equipment (mics, mixing console, etc). If the organizer refuses to pay, we're not gonna play.

Is this justified, reasonable behaviour in your eyes? How would you handle such a situation?"

"Hiiiiii

I'm F23 studying a remote part time university of music production to achieve my dream to became a music producers. For a project I have to create a couple of original tracks with the collaborations of musicians.

Unfortunately as a anti-social persone i don't know anyone that play an instrument that could help me. I ask to friends of my friends that  at the beginning accepted but then refuse cause to busy so I hoped I could find some help here. 

I ideally need to create a song in jazz fusion style and I would like for it someone that play guitar that could play a simple jazzy sample where I can work on. 

The second idea is create a song in style Bjork, where I would love a clarinet or something similar, to imitate her genre.

"TLDR: I'm an amateur player but I can play by ear pretty well on guitar (my friend say I have relatively perfect pitch) but I never know what notes I'm playing or what key which makes me feel stagnant.  


So for context, I had basic musical training when I was a kid (reading notes, learning keys and scales) but that's pretty much the extent of my formal training. I started with piano and learned guitar and then went to boarding school, so I couldn't get the instruction I was receiving anymore. 

My mum noticed pretty early that if I heard a song, I could fairly match the basic melody on the piano if I heard it enough times. Since then and now in my young adulthood, I've become more of a guitar enthusiast, and over the years, I can say that most of the time now,  if a song is playing, I can pick up the melody (and sometimes harmonize) in a couple seconds while it's being played. The main issue is I don't know how. 

I have no idea what notes I'm playing most of the time unless I actually try and pay attention to my finger position (which is hard to do if you're trying to match something on the fly). I can't explain to people how it happens but it just feels like if I can hear the song in my head, I can try to guess/predict where the next note will be. I'm grateful for the ability to do this but I'm also deeply frustrated by it sometimes because I would like to know what I'm playing. I would love to be able to identify what key I'm in, and even go up a level by figuring out what chords to play for the song rather than just the basic melody. However, I feel stuck and unsure of how to proceed from here (I'm also not in the position to get lessons because I'm a broke college student :( . If you guys have any tips or thoughts regarding any of this, I would greatly appreciate it!"

I prefer to use amp simulators to real amplifiers when playing guitar, as I can get a wider range of tones with amp simulators and can record my practice more easily. However, I'm having a problem with the sustain. I'm currently practicing vibrato exercises using a metronome. I've noticed that the guitar(I have a squire strat) cuts out sharply after it gets under a certain volume. At first I thought it was a guitar issue, however after playing around with turning up the gain on my audio interface, I noticed that I got more sustain(however the signal started distorting very badly). Does anyone have any idea what the underlying issue causing the lack of sustain and what I can do to help get more sustain.

"I think it‚Äôs important to get rid of reminders. I realize that it‚Äôs better to let it go and forget about it. Any memory is a reminder that I didn‚Äôt get anywhere any my life has been pointless ever since. I had posters and framed albums throughout my house. They are now in the trash where they belong. Why would I want reminders of my failure? We were one of the emo bands on Victory Records in the early 2000s. I never found a proper backup plan if the band failed. So now I‚Äôm 40. poor as fuck. Hate my career. Just a nobody that never achieved shit. The only thing people remember about me is a horrible tragedy. That‚Äôs the only thing on the internet when you seek me out.

"1.
every time i love i feel a new emotion
love
it feels like a ribbon flowing 
dancing around my heart 
every time i think to much it gets 
hard to try to cope and  
too many tears i can‚Äôt see 

i cant breathe i wanna sleep wanna go to sleep 
wake up the next day wondering 
why i decide to keep going on 
this feeling in my chest is growing so strong 
this ain‚Äôt even lyrics 
i just feel like i can‚Äôt go on 
emotions keep on changing 
forming newer ones never can understand
 i feel like the stupid one 
that cupid don 
he shot my heart 1 too many times 
now i‚Äôm done for once  
can‚Äôt seem to find a reality or some eternal bliss i‚Äôll put a switchblade to my wrist

rotten feelings in my chest 
feels like i‚Äôm unwanted by the rest 
horrid thoughts that taunt me 
history that feels like it‚Äôs haunting me
someone please hear me i yell out screaming 
a voice in my head tells me 
i should be dead
and that others around me 
want me laying in a ditch
 i don‚Äôt wanna live
 i don‚Äôt wanna die 
i don‚Äôt understand love or why 
i can‚Äôt understand myself
 i‚Äôll end my life quick

i would give you happiness

"Hi guys, how do you manage to get booked into the events? Like, clubs or festival? Is a matter of numbers or just good management? (which I don't have)
Because I've seen a line up of a festival and, some of the small acts barely made to 1k of monthly listeners. Could It be even a geographic reason? I mean, I know it's not all about the numbers, but even with very good tracks a nice stats, looks like I can't even get to play into small clubs. 

So, anyone can give me some advice? Anything I can do to have the opportunity of play my stuff out there? My country and my city sucks and are into really basic music and, in order to play, you need to lick their asses, no matter how good you are (with tracks and with cdj, of course)

"Hey! So I‚Äôve had a weird time lately with my band. Every time we play, we get rave reviews. People want CDs/recordings, they can‚Äôt wait to hear us again, venues say we killed it, they want us back. But for whatever reason, we‚Äôre not getting hired again. The venues I‚Äôve reached out to, I‚Äôve gotten a common response - they‚Äôre ‚Äúlooking for the perfect night for us,‚Äù and/or they just need to get past the rush of such and such. The more I‚Äôm hearing that, I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs code for ‚Äúyeah, we‚Äôre not really going to book you.‚Äù I mean‚Ä¶they‚Äôre booking other, somewhat similar bands‚Ä¶??

The problem is, I‚Äôve had so many people tell me we‚Äôre their favorite. I‚Äôve been compared to idols of mine and told I‚Äôm actually better than them. üò≥ I don‚Äôt truly think that, but I mean we‚Äôre worth having back! What gives??

Has anybody else heard this weird response from venues, they‚Äôre ‚Äúlooking for the right night,‚Äù??"

I start to think about little things. 

Like the mixing of the song. 

Is it even good or am I just impressed with myself bc I put some chords together? 

When I try to publish this, will it blow up or will people criticize it to the point where I will never dream about making music again?

Is this a constant mental struggle that other musicians go through as well? Is it something that I‚Äôm not alone in. Because I already want to quit even though I haven‚Äôt put anything out, but I get really proud in the stuff that I make."

"Wondering if anyone else here can relate: lately I have been experiencing mild to severe depression following performances. It usually sets in after everything is done and I‚Äôve gone home, beginning sometimes that night and sometimes the next day, and often lasting well into the next day or two. It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter if the performance was good or bad and if anything it seems like the better and more fulfilling the performance experience, the worse the depression is. This experience is relatively new to  me and is consistent enough to be noticeable. Does anyone else here experience anything like this?

For context I generally play a mixture of classical and original music either solo or in small groups, and I do experience depression at other times but music has previously been a reliable antidote. "
"It was awesome. Our band had a few nice shows at bars and the local moose lodge, but there was this house party where everyone was more baked than drunk, no fights, sex weirdos or none of that shit. We did a few covers, a few originals, and me and my friend sang as a duet.


The point of this story is.... immma do it again. I had to move to another state, make new friends, and now I have more practice time than before. Gonna become legends again people! Now I'm passing the positive vibes on to you!"
"I know some people pursue music privately and don't care about whether anyone likes it. But I know I'm not like that. Sure I can keep things private for a while but eventually I need to come out of my hole to catch a breath of air and to get feedback from the world. But with that comes the ups and downs of praise and criticism, and personally I get really distracted by that. Its especially disheartening when people seemingly fail to see the value of what we hold dear, probably because to them it's just another post to consume, whereas to us it's a piece of our vulnerable self. But then putting things out there also is motivating in itself. Its been a difficult balance. How do you guys manage that??"
This is probably better than I could do at least sonically in my home studio. I'm amazed

"I‚Äôm (28, male, drummer) in a band that I love. I love our music and I like the guys that I‚Äôm playing with. We‚Äôve got music released this year, more on the way, and we‚Äôve been playing a lot this year. 

The other guys in my group are 21, 20, and 19. 
A lot of their friends are under 21. 
An issue with our shows is that they want their friends to come in and watch us, which happens when we do backyard shows, but it‚Äôs more difficult when it‚Äôs at a bar. 

We just played a show at a bar, and one of the guys said that he doesn‚Äôt want to play there anymore because his girlfriend (age 19) can‚Äôt be inside watching us. 

I understand where they‚Äôre coming from, but in my opinion, it‚Äôs important for us to play to people that aren‚Äôt just our friends and peer group, we should play to as many different audiences as possible, and venues and bars are some of the best places to do that. 

I‚Äôve expressed this to them before but, they still don‚Äôt like the fact that bars and venues have age restrictions. 

What can I do more to let them know that it‚Äôs important for us to grow by stepping out of our comfort zone and playing for ‚Äúgrown ups‚Äù and strangers? "

"I've been experiencing occasional tinnitus or ringing in my ears for many years now, and as I've entered my 30s, it still pops up, especially after playing piano for extended periods or mixing music. It's not severe enough to cause pain, but it's definitely annoying and happens once or twice a few weeks, particularly when I'm tired.

I'm wondering if this is something I should be concerned about? It's not debilitating, but it does make me wonder if it's a sign of something more serious lurking beneath the surface.

Anyone else dealing with a similar situation where tinnitus isn't severe but still bothersome? How do you manage it, and have you found any ways to reduce its frequency or intensity?"

"Have been a musician for most of my life. I play keys and guitar in a variety of genres, though I mostly dabble with Latin styles (Cumbia, ranchera, bolero), r&amp;b, and rock. I love collaborating music writing with other people, but would love to make my own independent songs as well.

There are many songs I have written with a fleshed out form, harmony, bass, and melody, but I‚Äôve been sitting on for years because the threshold for me to lay down lyrics is so incredibly high. Coming up with musical motifs is second nature to me, but once I start writing lyrics, I hate them almost immediately, and then I stop altogether for months at a time.

Does anyone have any tips for writing or drafting lyrics in a systematic way? I feel like I need a system to get through lyric writing or I‚Äôll be always stuck.

"I‚Äôm being asked by some DJs what my rates are for writing/recording vocals for their tracks and I have no idea what the industry standard is for something like that. 

I‚Äôm assuming there‚Äôs two different rates; one for just recording vocals and one for writing the top line *and* recording it. I would assume any writing would come with a writing credit on the song. 

What‚Äôs typical to charge for these types of services?"
"Personally I think I sounds horrid. I am watching on stream, but anything above the lowest octave on the instrument sounds like a cheap bass being pushed too hard through little cheap Ampeg combo. The rest of the mix sounds good, so I'm assuming it's on the performer's side and that is the intentional sound being produced.

I'm aware of a certain desired tone/sound especially for the more ska, punk, and reggae influenced sounds, but it's so obtrusive in the mix. I'd def chill on those low-mids that sound like their being pushed really hard on the performer side of the gain staging.

I'm curious what others who have watched the stream think about that choice of tone, or if you think it's something lost in translation due the stream mix. Obviously this just my opinion but I'd love to hear what other musicians think about it and if my judgement on the tone is misplaced or not.

Note: I mixed live sound (primarily rock, punk, ska, reggae, metal, etc.) for about 8 years. Also, I have a friend (non-musician) working the festival who says it's probably the stream mix."

"Hi everyone :) 

I‚Äôm looking for some advice and thought maybe some users here would have insight.  I just released my very first single. I‚Äôve pasted links below for Apple Music and Spotify. 

I have five other songs that have been produced and just need to be mixed and mastered. 

But I don‚Äôt really know which direction to go‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt foresee myself spending hours a day on social media, curating content. 

But I also don‚Äôt see myself going out and playing covers in bars every night. 

To be clear, I‚Äôm happy to play live. I‚Äôd just like to do so in an intentional setting. 

I‚Äôd really like to attract the attention of a record label that shared enthusiasm in my work and such. But I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs how the cookie crumbles nowadays. Any ideas? 

Edit: my focus with this post is to try and hear NEW IDEAS. I agree 100% that the standard avenues today are to gig and put content online. 

Here‚Äôs a few suggestions I‚Äôve heard in the past and in these comments: 

‚Ä¢ entering singer/songwriter competitions 

‚Ä¢ attending music conferences with a music portfolio 

‚Ä¢ create a schedule of open mics in your area and do those weekly

‚Ä¢ dedicating extra funds to booking agents, social media management, etc. 

In the not-so-distant past, people who marketed themselves online were laughed at. Now, it‚Äôs the only way. Does it seem possible that in the future, there may be alternative routes for attracting an audience?

"About 10 years ago I had a band with a few close friends. We've since faded, but still have each other on social media and whatnot, we haven't caught up in years but are still on good terms.

When we used to jam, my buddy had this warmup riff he used to play that I LOVED. I don't think he ever did anything with it, or if he even remembers it at this point. I'd love to use it as a song intro, but I'm not sure if it's appropriate to ask him if I can have it or not. What do you guys think?"
"I think my problem as a solo singer songwriter is that I've been trying to interpret my 'full band rock song' style songs on stage as a solo singer songwriter. It just ends up sounding incomplete somehow when played live. 

So... I'm thinking like... when Richard Dawson or Jake Xerxes Fussell play live, it doesn't sound like it's missing anything. It sounds like it's *supposed* to be played solo - one guitar, one voice, even when - in the case of RD - it's climactic and loud and almost metallic sounding.

Even Elliott Smith, or Junior Brother, who has been recommended to be off the back of loving Richard Dawson's work, augments his live shows with other musicians.

I want to be influenced by music which is authentic, idiosyncratic, and sounds like it was supposed to be played by one person and a guitar. 

I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me some artists to draw influence from. No particular genre, but preferably not Jeff Buckley or that type of thing.

Who should I look up? Thanks folks! "
"So I've always wondered how else this works around the world but I wanna talk about unsigned bands getting paid. Here in the UK, mostly when you start out, it's very rare to get paid for a show. Here there's a lot of door deals, where a venue give you a cut of the money from the people that came to the venue to see you specifically. Obviously no one knows who you are, and getting just a small handful of friends can be very difficult if it's a crappy day of the week and you don't play until 10pm.

I've always thought about it this way, a venue needs to make money, if you don't bring anyone then no money is going over the bar and the venue are losing money with staff and running costs. It's the music BUSINESS, so if you can't make any money for the venue, then why should they give you anything?

But let's have a healthy debate over this...how does it work in your part of the world?

"Is it normal to wait months and have poor communication from producers? I am feeling incredibly stuck because I can't get any of my songs back. I get drafts and then provide feedback, and changes are extremely slow. I sent several songs in January and it's always ""will work on it this week."" I'm getting a great discount/deal and even offered to pay more for faster timelines but he assured me he would get it back to me. I have been very gracious and accommodating and made the mistake of saying ""no more timelines"" one day because I didn't want anyone to feel pressured. But now, time is slipping by and I am unable to release songs or make my ableton live sets without these masters. I don't feel like i can just find someone new because I like the quality and style I'm getting, but I'm at that point where I pretty much have to start finding someone new. Or is this just how it is? pls help :'( Also please advise how I can turn back the no timelines comment without being a jerk, I didn't think it would be taken that liberally.

I have been trying to get my music taken down for 7 MONTHS. 7 months &amp; nothing from customer service. It's basically non-existent. I must've sent at least 20 emails &amp; support requests at this point. It's ridiculous.

I switched over from Distrokid because when they first launched they were promising a ""blue checkmark"" for those who signed up, that never happened. I figured my audience is from Tiktok so I'd just switch because it was free as opposed to Distrokid's $37 a year fee. BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY CAREER.

"I've grown up listening and playing music but for the past few years I've started to hesitate when people ask if music is my passion LOL

i have love for it but at the same time SOOO much heartache comes with it (and so many breakdowns) because as the improvement curve becomes gentler and my expectations increase with my increase in skill level, reaching expectations becomes harder and I just get less satisfied that i see little to no improvement. It's honestly what holds me back from pursuing music professionally. I enjoy it much more when im messing around and not caring, but thats at the cost of good playing

Does anyone else have this issue?"

"An underrated song from the most underrated motorhead album. Heavy is the word. Just 3 musicians and they make it sound like an entire army is playing the war anthem.

Mikkey Dee is the MVP here, killer playing, killer writing and killer drummung. Especially during the solo, which was quite common when he had joined motorhead, especially in bastards and sacrifice. Phil is great at his job too.

Lemmy seems to be on some good goodamn intense high, vocals are as hellish as they have gotten in motorhead. The bass is at the peak of distortion, mostly complements the guitar on this one. 4 minutes and makes the body sore as hell.

Only challenge is the intensity of the song, one of the most intense songs I have covered. Figured out the tabs by ears. 

Genre - Thrash Metal / Heavy Metal 
Original Bassist - Lemmy Kilmister
From the album 'Snake Bite Love'

Hope you enjoy, please drop a like and subscribe to my channel, thanks ü§ò

"Have you ever done a gig where there was another band/performer in close proximity to your thing, scheduled at the same time (or overlapping), to where you and your audience could clearly hear the other performance as well as yours? How was that experience? If that venue offered you more gigs, would that become a factor?  

And if that *hasn‚Äôt* happened to you, how do you think you would feel about that if it did?"

"So my husband is in a new band and they were discussing merch. Obviously Tshirts, mugs, etc came up in conversation. I can make the mugs hell I can make the tshirts myself too if I wanted but I‚Äôd rather not. Anyway. I 3D printed some keychains with the band logo on it. I have a huge printer. I could probably print at least 50 of them at the same time. They cost almost nothing in filament. I can do different colors etc. But the other band members don‚Äôt think anyone would buy a keychain for a band they don‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôm more of the opinion people would buy a $5 keychain over a $20 tshirt or a $15 mug. (Hypothetically numbers but you get the idea.)

From June on we'd like to play a sjow a month but we've never had gigging experience. How do you do it? Maybe try to open for other bands? And how so?

"Hi all, 

I am planning my wedding for this coming June. My wife (we got married - just couldn't afford the wedding until now) has played violin for almost 10 years and one of her only requests during early planning was to have live violin during our ceremony. 

Due to some unexpected issues with finding a venue, we haven't been able to start looking for a lot of our vendors until recently, including ceremony musicians. Most musicians we've reached out to have been unavailable, so we started reaching out to people we knew, friends of friends, etc. 

My sister's roommate volunteered to play. I asked my sister for her contact information and if she has a rate that she already charges. My sister is majorly busy (engineering student), so I haven't heard back from her. We are requesting she play a specific song for the walk. She would be playing for 1-2 hours. She would also be invited to attend the reception as guest (if she wants) if that changes anything.  I want to be able to to properly budget for paying my sister's roommate and was wondering what people would recommend as a rate for this. 

Thanks in advance!"

"ETA: in general, seems like I‚Äôve been overthinking things and expecting too much(makes sense, I do it all the time), so I got high, cleaned the living room (messes bug the crap out of me), and am watching One Piece. Later when my brain comes back I‚Äôll go do something fun on bass - and tomorrow deal with *just* the two songs that my band leader pointed out after the last show, and not every other thing that was wrong when I watched the video back.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
What do you do on those days when you need to work on your playing, but every little mistake just feeds into the ‚ÄúI suck, how did I ever think I could go pro with this, if I haven‚Äôt gotten *this*(details in a second) by now, how will I ever get it‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I‚Äôm on meds for my depression, stuck with female plumbing so hormone whackiness may be exacerbating things‚Ä¶ but I need to practice, I can‚Äôt just wallow in negativity. We‚Äôve got band practice on monday and I need to have a couple tunes down by then. They‚Äôre not that hard, but I need to woodshed on them.

I always wonder if I‚Äôm expecting too much from myself‚Ä¶ I joined this band 6 months ago. We‚Äôve got some 60+ songs in the repertoire, no charts on stage, and the band leader wants to be a grateful dead style ‚Äòno set lists‚Äô on stage. I play bass, and it‚Äôs folky stuff (so no crazy Geddy Lee level bass lines)‚Ä¶ but am I crazy to try to expect to have all these arrangements memorized by now? This is my first dive into being a full time musician, with a local band that‚Äôs *just* starting to break out nationally.

Trying to find a house and move states definitely hampered my practice time the last 3 months‚Ä¶ but this band is my job - it‚Äôs my responsibility to have my shit together. It was a little easier in November/December because we were playing or practicing once or twice a week. Along with moving, we‚Äôve only had 2 gigs a month in feb/march/april, and I haven‚Äôt been practicing with the band leader at all. All the band practice has been on-boarding the new fiddler or working on studio prep for our first album.

"Hello, I would be very grateful if someone could help me with this. I have a piece of music for the piano as part of a band for a show but the music is really horrible to read and I need to learn it quite quickly. Here are pictures of the score and you can see all the double flats where surely it could be written in an easier way by changing the key signature but keeping the same notes so that for example a D double flat would be written as a normal C (C natural)? Is this possible? If anyone can help me with this either telling me how to do it or doing it for me that would be so helpful thank you! I am an advanced pianist who's been playing for 11 years but I did my music theory exam years ago and have forgotten a lot of it and how to alter music online as I have never played in a band before."
"I've never been a big fan - always found him predictable and boring. But I was intrigued enough by a YouTube short title (something about him showing some speed) to watch, and I was quite amazed to see that his whole lead was just using the 1st and 2nd fingers of his fretting (left) hand. I was wondering if this has always been his ""technique"" or if he was compensating for some sort of injury for this specific performance. Clapton fans - is this how he always does it?"

"I‚Äôve never considered myself a particularly good sightreader. I‚Äôve gotten much better over the years, but this past year or so, more and more, it‚Äôs been getting worse. Not in the way that my skills are degenerating, but I‚Äôm having new issues.

For example:

I‚Äôm reading notes as if they are a step or so off from where they actually are. I see a note, and i can play the note that my eyes think it is automatically, but i look closer and it‚Äôs not the note i SAW it as. 

Lots of ink can mean i can‚Äôt decipher anything. My actual rhythm literacy is just fine, but everything just melds together when i see it too close together on the page. This goes for rhythm, for a ton of accidentals, whatever else.

In addition, things like noticing myself sitting much closer to my music, leaning in more during more complex passages, and writing marks in my music noticeably larger, darker, and more frequent than my stand partners and neighbors all make me convinced that I do indeed have problems with my vision.

Has anyone else had this problem? Was it because of bad vision? Did you notice a significant improvement in sightreading ability or general comprehension once you got glasses? 



TL,DR: I misread notes, lots of ink means i can‚Äôt see, and i sit closer and add more and bigger marks to my music. I think i have vision problems that are crippling my sightreading. has anyone else dealt with this?

"myspace would give you 100 listeners in a week without any promotion. Soundcloud 5 months ago did the same. But today, if you don't promote your own music, it won't get any listeners anywhere. 

Distribution platforms just want your money and won't promote you at all.

There's no platforms for new listeners to go after new music.

If you're an artist on spotify you don't even know the people that listen to you. You don't have a way to connect with your audience!

I'm not saying you don't need to promote your music. I'm just saying there's no platform that will at least make you be heard if you don't go around posting some links. And this is not  good!

I don't know about you guys, but all my friends only discover new music on spotify. Not sometimes on soundcloud, sometimes on youtube, ONLY on spotify.

There's no mail list, no liking or replying comments from fans, no way to make your audience feel like they are part of a group.

"Short version:

I have (in the past) blown off an opportunity to live out a part of my dream to make a living playing guitar, due to anxiety and stress. I have another opportunity now. I'm forcing myself to go thru the motions this time, but just thinking about memorizing 50 songs, playing 'good' on stage, stage presence, social aspect.. makes me weak. 

---Tips on how to deal or work with this anxiety?   
Stories of your experiences of making the switch from amateur endless-repetition bands to (semi-)professional musician life?



[Long version, extra info and blabbering]

So I've been playing guitar for a long time and one of my old bands' bandmembers, has since gone 'professional'. Also, since then he has forwarded or recommended me to similar bands 'in his scene' at least twice (he's such a great friend and bro for that and I feel like such opportunities really are not be wasted.. but I know I'm a guy that wastes opportunities..). 

These bands are regional party-cover bands that play 2-3x a week for ~1k to ~3k people.

I just can't seem to take the plunge, my heartbeat goes wild just thinking about it (being on stage for large crowd, being expected to sound good -to drunk crowds but also bandmembers and mostly myself probably-, I'm not much on the social part and as a non-alcoholic don't enjoy staying around long after jams or shows).

I am a more technically developed guitarist than my friend (I am a practice nerd but to be fair I also started playing the instrument years before he did), but his confidence and trust in me is much bigger than I have for myself. I make up a million excuses for why I couldn't do it, or imagine myself on stage and somehow my stomach churns and I think I'll do bad or something? I know I can play okay on the guitar, but I suffer hard from the imposter-syndrome ish thoughts and often project my insecurities in imaginary future situations.. I hope you get the point.

I feel like the cliche where at this point the biggest thing holding me back from achieving my dreams, is me lol. 

---How do you know if you can do it? 
What was it like for you?Does anyone of you struggle with anxiety as a performing musician? Can you point me in the right direction, do I need to 'just do it', am I not cut out for it? Also, How did you transition from the 9-5 salary life?"
"I'm a Catholic church organist (3 yrs experience) and pianist (16 yrs experience), and I have 6 prospective clients this year.

Fellow wedding musicians, esp. organists &amp; pianists, what are you charging this year?"

"After years of playing in bands for other guys, I finally started my band about a year ago. We‚Äôre playing original songs which I wrote myself and then taught all my friends (bandmates) how to play.

We‚Äôre practiced enough now to the point now where we‚Äôre show-ready and have our first single ready for release but since it‚Äôs sort of ‚Äúmy band‚Äù I‚Äôm more or less responsible for reaching out and getting us gigs.  In previous bands, it was usually a different guy in the band handling all of the booking stuff and I would just show up and play.  

Do you reach out to the promoters? The venue? Bands playing a specific show? Are there any secret techniques for getting cool opportunities and not playing five hour long sets of bar covers?


tl;dr: I started a band but don‚Äôt know how to approach getting us out there playing shows and so forth, how do you guys do that?"

"The reason I ask is because this drummer got back in touch with me. The way he left was really bad. He accused me of stealing ""his drum ideas"" for songs I had already written before I met the dude. He didn't have nice things to say about me when we parted ways. He said I was wasting his time. But he apologized to me recently and im a firm believer in forgiving people. 

It's just drumming is nothing I can't do and im not sure the guy deserves another shot. Even if I forgive him. The point is he might think if he decides to leave again that the music belongs to him or something. It really doesn't. My music is very guitar driven with some room for spicing things up on the kit. But drumming can always be redone or altered. I didn't steal a song I wrote before I met this drummer. It was already my original work. Anyways, do we jam or should I forget about it?"

"Hey all :)

So I'm a semi professional keyboardist, my current rig consists of a Roland JDX-i 37 keys and a Yamaha P-125 88 key. I currently play in a metal band and in a wedding band. 

The metal band is mostly originals and just a few covers, where I'd need mostly a good strings, choir, strong church organ and ocassionally some electronic stuff. A good guitar like sound (jordan rudess style) would be very useful. 

In the wedding band we mostly play pop and rock songs but I need the synth quite a lot for that and sometimes it's difficult to get the sound I want, not that I can't edit it but I need to be able to access these sounds quickly and easily really. 

Im looking to upgrade mostly as I feel the sounds I have just aren't that good and the roland jdxi means it takes me a while to switch sounds sometimes. Ive checked how to save sounds to favourites on the roland but, honestly, it's pretty buggy. I had the Novation mini nova before and although the sounds were a bit too weird, the sounds were much easier to access quickly. 

Im tempted to try a midi keyboard where I can load the sounds but a laptop during a live show worries me cause what if it crashes or something so I'm a bit skeptical about that.

Im open to any suggestions from more experienced people perhaps, really appreciate any feedback or suggestions you've got :) "

"So I'm doing my first longer performance/tour de force of four songs. I'm getting serious anxiety over my chosen songs. I'm worried that they aren't the best that I could have chosen. Two of the songs I love, and really want to sing them. But the other two I'm not so sure about. It's not like I'm worried that I can do them technically, I'm more concerned about not being able to perform them comfortably interpretation-wise. Like If I start to feel embarrassed about their overly vulnerable and romantic lyrics, or if the songs are too slow in rhythm and people start  to lose interest in the midst. I should send my sheets to the piano player like yesterday so this is the literal last chance to change anything. I'm not sure if it will be worth it to me to harrass my teacher and piano player with last minute changes, on the other hand, this is my opportunity. Am I overthinking? Is it more important to stick to the choices?  Have y'all been comfortable with all of your songs or do you take it as part of the experience if your choices were less than ideal? Some advice, support or sharing your experience could really help me out thank you ?"
"I knew they were expensive but I didn't think they were *this* expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

Molds were $75 per ear and the plugs I'll get back with one set of filters (-15db) were $225 per ear. Total $600. If I want extra filters like a -25db that will be an extra cost. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked if I could take the moldings they made and shop around for different plugs since the audiologist was only selling that one brand for that much, but the doc said if I bought online there's no quality assurance, whereas with her I'll come back and she'll do a leak-test. Rationally it seemed legit but emotionally I'm feeling a little strong-armed.

"Hi!

EDIT&amp;TLDR: View AI as another paintbrush or as a new form of keyboard‚Ä¶AI in and of itself is no more art than a paintbrush, in desperate need of a painter to steady it‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

What started out as a rant against those who are afraid of AI in the arts, evolved into a tip that I believe will help many of you who are concerned: using AI to further your compositions. 

Any great artist knows that exposure and reference are huge assets (primarily in developing talent) but also in becoming inspired. Instead of viewing AI as a never ending source of soulless music - view it as the next evolution of iTunes; the Record Shop; the Library; the Opera House; simply a place to find new ideas

Imagine you have an idea in your head. You type it into Youtube to try and find something similar but alas, to no avail. Instead, take it into something such as SUNO. Knowing how AI works, it is fair to assume this is an amalgamation of existing compositions. So generate your prompt. BUT don‚Äôt stop there! Bring that piece into your DAW or transcribe it. Rewrite the melody. Sample it into a new beat. Deconstruct the harmony and harmonize against it. Take the melody and write new lyrics. A prompt isn‚Äôt yours. MAKE IT YOURS. 


Look, i know it‚Äôs easy to think that this is uncharted territory. But it‚Äôs not. Humans have innovated since time immemorial. Make it your tool. Don‚Äôt become it‚Äôs b*tch.

"Hi I'm a clarinet player I'm going to a university next week for an audition for get into their music school. I'm really worried because on of the prepared pieces I have to play is in cut time and my teacher recommended I try to play it at 160bpm in fast four. I've not been practicing as much as I should have I admit but every time I practice I feel like I get worse and I miss notes and rhythms I shouldn't.

I tried to major in music before and I quit bc of the stress and I lost all of my confidence I barely played my instrument for a while and I really want to get into this school but they're really well known and a lot of people want to be there.

What can I do to be as best as I can by next week?"
"I‚Äôve got 60 solid cover tunes, killer rig, pa, lighting, YouTube page, FB page. Now I just need gigs, and they seem really hard to come by. Maybe I‚Äôm going about it wrong?

Is it a bad idea to follow up the emails with maybe a FB message, or a call? I‚Äôd hate to pester managers or bar staff, but it seems like I‚Äôm spinning my wheels. 

Is it necessary to show face at the venues and just keep asking and just bide my time? Some gigs lead to more gigs kinda thing? I know I can‚Äôt expect to take over the local music scene overnight, maybe patience is the biggest thing here. Any kind of input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. "

"Hey, fellow music enthusiasts!

**Advice needed!!!!**

So, picture this: I've ( 27 F) been serenading shower walls and kitchen utensils forever. My love for music? It's been there like a loyal sidekick. But then life happened, and I ended up majoring in something that promised more cash flow than melody. Now that I am a little more settled and have some money to invest in my musical interest, I want to keep pursuing music.

I've decided it's time to reignite the musical flame within me, but I need your help, oh wise ones of the musical realm! I'm looking to invest more into my musical abilities, with dreams of teaching music to kids and maybe even gracing more stages with my presence. **But where do I start?**

Group lessons seem like a solid first step, but beyond that, I'm navigating uncharted territory. So, fellow musicians, teachers, and music aficionados hit me with your best advice! **Whether it's tips for finding the perfect vocal coach, recommendations for getting involved in the local music scene, or pearls of wisdom for aspiring music educators, I'm all ears (and vocal cords)! Also, do you think I must go back to school for a BA in Music to pursue music education?**

I appreciate all the advice!!"

"I've seen a couple of local bands putting cards out on tables with QR codes for sending tips via Venmo.

In the past we've set up a sign next to our tip jar with a code, but it never brings in much, if anything.  Has anyone tried the card idea, and if so, how did it work for you?

EDIT:  Just to reiterate, we use a code already next to our tip jar, but it doesn't work.  I might get $5 in e-tips and $200 in cash.

I'm asking about **separate cards like business cards** that you can put on **each table** to solicit tips, not the general concept of e-tipping.  There are bands doing this in our local scene, but I don't know if it works for them.  That's what I'm trying to find out.

"I've seen so many posts about people complaining that their music is not making it, yet they do 0 PR, Don't invest in a manager, don't build a brand and image. Don't actually engage with fans, ect. One of my biggest lessons was to start taking myself seriously as an artist and stop just dropping on Bandlab and Snapchat with a song I made in a day posting it on my story and calling it good.

I have no tik tok, do not even know what a PR firm is or does, have no marketing plan, no costumes, no videos, no plans to do live performance 

why did I expect to ever blow up? 

From now on i plan to take songs slow 100s of takes if I have to, only make music that actually means something to me emotionally, and actually pay for stems send projects to professionals to get mixed, have a marketing and roll out plan. I hate even making this post instead of just doing it but I feel like it needs to be said and maybe actualizing it into words is good.

sometimes I feel like leaving this reddit because of all the sad people who want to be famous and the lack of actual creative conversation. 

It sounds weird but maybe because you want to blow up, you're making music for it to be received well rather than truly expressing yourself and that hides the uniqueness that you could be bringing to music.

Yeah that rapper kinda sucks and has millions but he also is himself and took his music and art seriously and went and learned the professional route to producing and marketing a record.

Even your favorite great artists or underground artists, they didn't get traction until they got professional help in some shape or form and they invested thousands and thousands into even the earliest records

Get references, and inspiration, plan hard and invest into a more professional route, to the rappers out there, even Kanye has to have his beats go through multiple people and levels of mastering 

Take yourself and the art seriously to the most meticulous level of expression,  produce records that actually mean something deeply to YOU, and Invest into professional help and knowledge to get them out to the world and I guarantee you wouldn't be on Reddit complaining about others making it."

"Hi, all! 

I have a wedding coming up. It'll be pretty small, and I found a song that I'm in love with that I think would sound amazing with a singer with a guitar/ukulele singing it. It's Rather Be Me (With You) from Steven Universe if you're curious. 

The song is only a little over a minute long, I'd probably want the song to be sung a little slower and maybe just have the instrumental playing until I walk all the way down. 

Ofc the ceremony will be probably no longer than 20 min. How much do you think that'll cost? 

I'm in Austin, TX if that matters. 

Thanks!"
"So I've been playing music my whole life, and guitar especially since I was in middle school. I've loved it and enjoyed it my whole life. Music has been a major part of who I am. I've played for fun, played gigs for money, played just for the sake of it, etc. I enjoy all genres, country, math rock, metal, gospel, everything. I just loved music.

Writing music has always been my favorite part of music, and composition is the main driver for why I have continued to play. I can't listen to songs without ""hearing"" new parts, so as a result I've never really listened to much music, plus I get more obsessed with whatever new earworm popped into my head. Moreover, I sing my own made up melodies in church (we do acapella only) since I can express the music I feel like should be. I can't even walk around without getting my own made up melodies stuck in my head, and the only cure has always been to learn the part on an instrument. As a result, I've made a lot of great songs, some fading into obscurity and some gaining some traction, though I only ever did it for its own sake rather than that it would be appreciated--like if a song I kept hearing against my will didn't exist and I didn't actualize it then it felt almost like the world was not right and thus I must actualize it. Music has become such apart of my life, my son's middle name is a pun for music (that I can't share since this is a throwaway).   


Lately, though, I just look at all my gear, all my skills, the time I've spent on its vanity, and I just find myself filled with disgust and resentment. I hate that I spend time playing music rather than learn a practical skill like wood working or being with my family. I hate that I am so drawn to an instrument, and I hate that I can't bring myself to rid myself of them as many were gifts. I find myself now even hating everything about the concept of melody, harmony, rhythm, the fact its intelligible, the fact it manipulates emotions for better or for worse rather than what the person genuinely feels without modification. I hate that it distracts me, I hate the fact that I can't be free of it when I sleep at night and a melody comes to me against my will. I hate that I can't go to church and worship without hearing music, that even when I try to ""shut off"" and just focus on the Lord. I hate that I can't escape the unheard melodies plaguing me as a lock up my house at night, nor can I walk around listening to a podcast without some made up sound tormenting me. I hate that I can't sit in silence in my car without an old song coming to mind, or a conversation with someone reminding me of a song I once heard and the melody embedding itself into me. I hate that I can't listen to other people's music without wanting to join in or appreciating it as it already is. I hate the idea of monetizing my music to the extent that I live off it, but I also hate the idea of not monetizing something I've spent so much time and effort refining. I hate the feeling of shame of playing instead of doing something else, and I hate the shame of feeling like I wasted my life refining a vain skill.  


I don't feel burnt out; I feel cursed. I love music, I think, but I am becoming overwhelmed with disdain and hatred for it. Honestly, I **never** want to hear another note again in my life again, questioning if I would be happier deaf, but I also shudder at the idea as I doubt I could escape my curse of creativity."

"Update: Thank you everybody for your responses. After considering all your perspectives, getting an opinion from a good buddy who has worked with the artist numerous times in the past, and having a follow up convo with him not having time for a jam sesh but explaining his music mentality and methodology, and weighing the risks vs benefits, I have decided to give it a go with the artist I posted about. Mahalo!

I have a VIP client that I do all their expos for as a duo. My bandmate recently quit music so I've been building up an alternate roster. We do live looping, live jamming lounge instrumentals. The gig is to provide low level background music to greet expo attendees at the front door. I've brought on one new bandmate that I've busked with several times, so there's been a certain level of vibe and trust established. There are two days, my new bandmate is taking day 1 with me. I would ideally like to use day 2 for another musician to expand the bandmate roster for future gigs. If not, I'll bring in the new bandmate.

One much more established musician in my network has expressed interest in the gig. I've seen him perform many times, we know each other through these performances as I have worked many events with his talent buyer. However, we don't know each other on a personal level, have never hung out outside a show, or ever played music together. Show is in a couple weeks. I've asked to jam first to see how we vibe and he says he's too busy. I'm only considering him an option because I've seen him perform before several times, like his music and it would be fun to perform with him. I have expressed to him that this is my VIP repeat client and I do not want to deliver a less quality product than what they are used to. He says as long as he knows the keys it'll be fine. I get this, but I think there's a lot more to vibing in a performance duo than just knowing the keys.

I've only ever performed a paid gig with people I've jammed with before. Am I being too anal here? Do you guys have wisdom to share? I'm currently leaning towards a no.

Edit: My instrumentals, while not overly complicated IMO, are originals."

"Just want to know people's thoughts? I'm an a few bands and run my own aswell. This does not happen a lot but whenever I come across a player that came unprepared the normal thing I do is to ask someone else next time to take there place. 

I used to give these players some slack and hoping they play better next time but almost always they mess up. So now I'm a lot less patient, especially if the gigs I get are paid well. 

These actions have gotten me in a bit of bother. A great guitarist and good friend of mine was this kind of player who didn't practice. I passed the next gig off to another guitarist and he was really upset with me, saying that ""as a band leader, I would have appreciated a lot more direction from you and we would not have had this problem"". 

Btw, all my music has recordings, demos and charts written out. 

I find it really hard to confront people about there playing, that's why I have stuck to my normal method. But now I'm open to more solutions.

Not on streaming quite yet but I‚Äôll get on that 
Me and friends formed a band about a year ago expressly to bring my original indie rock compositions to life. 3 out of the 4 members (including myself) have families and live a fairly busy life. Initially we agreed to meet up once a month to jam and rehearse. But every time we get together we can't seem to nail the 4-5 songs that we've been working on. A couple of the guys think it's because we only meet once a month. They're  saying we need to play more. Unfortunately I really cannot get out of family commitments unless the sessions are scheduled a few months in advance. Is once a month really not enough to learn 4-5 songs? Am I expecting too much?

"im basically just seeking job ideas for someone in their early 20‚Äôs thats trying to be in a band for a living. currently, my friend and i work at a regular fast food job just to pay the rent and bills, (and we‚Äôre saving up for studio time) but we really want to find a place to work thats going to be more aligned with our ultimate goal. working fast food 40hrs a week is not good for our mental health, and makes it hard to practice. even on the days we‚Äôre off due to being tired and mentally preparing for the next shift. does anyone have any ideas? we arent classically trained in our instruments, nor have we studied music theory in or out of school. we‚Äôre just two guys who finished high school and immediately started trying to pursue our dreams at any cost. that being said, im just not sure if something like a studio assistant or music teacher would be a good option for us. ive been racking my brain but i cant seem to think of anything that would make sense. the best i can come up with would be to work at a music venue or something like that. any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated. thank you!!"
"So recently I‚Äôve seen some applications that can create some really incredible simulations of music. I think this is awesome and is (imo) kind of one of the final steps toward true ‚Äúpunk‚Äù expression. A literal music generation technology from the psyche of any person would be the only think I can think of beyond that.

I think it‚Äôs amazing how far the technology has come and has increasingly made ‚Äúnon-musicians‚Äù be able to make music. I know that sounds elitist, but I mean it in the best way possible. I don‚Äôt literally mean I don‚Äôt consider purely production or raw perseverance based musicians musicians, but if we consider the act of musical performance a trade in itself I think it is a fair argument to make that there are musicians and then there are MUSICIANS. Feel me?

Anyway with this being the case now, what is the future like for musicians, and do you believe the trade of music will become irrelevant or more respected?

I personally believe that if literally every person could just start generating music down the line it would definitely topple the recording industry entirely at some point and would take a lot of emphasis off of celebrity as a method of ingesting music and art. However, I do think maybe the perceived value and appeal of those that can learn, perform, or improvise music would go waaaay up. It would kind of recast musicians as what they are meant to be, which is a tradesmen of entertainment. Not a special genius that speaks for a generation or some corny shit, just dudes good at making sounds happen fr.

I also feel like if people can generate recordings themselves, the value of seeing music that is not immediately being performed would be diminished. Not entirely, but I definitely think it would be less sought after.

Also, down the line if people can generate ideas brain to reality in the future, imagine how insane bands could become and what fusions of analog performance with bio-digital could entail?

Idk what do you think?

"I play bass in a band whose name follows the formula ‚ÄúSinger Songwriter and the Something Band‚Äù

The singer is the band leader and writes all of the songs before bringing them to the band to put together. We each write our own instrument parts for the songs. 

The singer books gigs which we split evenly. The singer also financed the recording of the EP that was just released. 

None of the band members were paid for writing and recording their parts,and also won‚Äôt get any royalties because we didn‚Äôt write the songs, but did write our parts.

I guess my question is, when you are a band member and not just a hired gun, what should you be getting paid for and what should you be getting royalties for? Should I ask for a minimum for every gig regardless of how much we get paid total? Should I ask to be paid for rehearsal time where I write my part to his song? Should I be paid for studio time where I record the part to his song?
(I realize at the level we are at, the financial aspect of royalties are far less important than the principle) 

EDIT: Thanks for all the thoughtful responses 

For Background‚Ä¶ Singer wrote and recorded an album with session musicians, then decided to put a band together so he could play it live. All of the songs he‚Äôs written since the first album have been written by him alone then arranged by the band in rehearsal. When he said he wanted to record the EP with those new songs, he took care of everything. But the line is kind of blurred between band member and hired Gun because Singer paid for the studio, mastering, etc, but the idea of paying the band for studio time never came up and I‚Äôm wondering if it should have, if we have no true stake in the band. Or should we have a small percentage or the royalties for being the band that recorded all of the songs and had input on putting them all together in rehearsals? "
"I‚Äôm looking for recommendations on a device I can load .wav files onto that has buttons to trigger an audio clip so my band can use it at shows for intro samples.

Ideally it would be a button I can step on like a guitar pedal. 5 or 6 buttons to be used for each specific song would be great. 

I have my eye on the Behringer FCB1010 but am open to any suggestions! Thanks "

I‚Äôm a 21 year old dude who has a 2016 Chrysler Town and Country and I have no kids. Just music gear I carry in the back. I carry my bass cabinets and amps along with my guitarist‚Äôs gear and drum set. I‚Äôve been made fun of it because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsoccer mom van‚Äù and of course I like to make fun of myself for it too but I‚Äôm curious if anyone else who has one for the same purpose I do. 
"*cross-posted, sorry if this isn‚Äôt the right place for this!

Hi all, I wanted to ask some things, and I don‚Äôt really have anyone in my life that can answer them right now? I‚Äôm a music major (22f), so far have talked to a therapist who said I most likely have moderate ADHD, and I‚Äôm struggling SO MUCH to practice. I‚Äôve tried to look up other stories online to see if anyone else has the same experience as me, but it seems like the majority of people are able to really easily focus on music because it‚Äôs something they‚Äôre really passionate about? I‚Äôm struggling to have a routine, actually put in work for my degree, etc, and it constantly makes me feel like maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be in this major because I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot as passionate.‚Äù

Once I start, I love practicing, but I like playing with other people in the large performing ensembles more. I‚Äôve always really, really enjoyed it, and ever since elementary/middle school when I picked up an instrument, I haven‚Äôt had any rhyme or reason with practicing (which at this point, isn‚Äôt helping me at all, it‚Äôs SO HARD to learn what I need to learn, and I feel like I‚Äôm sabotaging myself). I feel like I used to totally hyperfocus more on music too when I practiced, but as I got older, I shifted focus more away from music. I love it, so much, but I feel like something is wrong for me for not actively hyperfocusing on music like I think would be nicer at this point. One thing I DO hyperfocus on is crochet, I got back into it a couple of years ago and have done a ton with it. But, I wish I could just apply that passion to music, something that I know I love, everyone around me tells me I love, but I can‚Äôt seem to actually show that love, I guess. 

Would anyone have any tips or tricks? Planners really haven‚Äôt worked for me in the past, and I‚Äôve had a terrible track record with trying to establish new habits. I just want to feel like the main portion of my degree isn‚Äôt such a struggle, maybe know how to motivate myself, and feel like I deserve to be there in the first place. I‚Äôve had a ton of imposter syndrome over the past few years, and I wish I didn‚Äôt treat practicing like every other procrastinating assignment. 

Thanks no matter what :)"

"I‚Äôm sure a lot of the common etiquette and things to know/prepare for seem obvious to those who have been in the game for a while. But to someone who‚Äôs a bedroom musician looking to start playing live, it may not be so evident.

What are the most important/essential/beneficial/(etc.) things to know when getting into the live scene?

And what do you wish you knew about before you began gigging? As in, what you would go back and tell yourself from the past with the knowledge you have now.

Would really appreciate any and all replies. Thanks! :)

[If it matters, my plan is to perform live as a solo artist (primarily focusing on original material) but with a fuller sound than just 1 instrument; I‚Äôll create fully instrumented tracks, remove the parts I can play live, then play along to what then functions as a backing track. It‚Äôs unideal - obviously I wish I could convey the full experience 100% live - but alas, I only have 4 limbs and 1 mouth, and am lacking the finances to constantly hire people to play my stuff.]"
"So me and a couple buddies from music school got together and made a band. We are in a small town with no local band so word traveled fast. We keep getting offers to do gigs at local bars and event centers. We have a full band (sax/trumpet/trombone) plus guitar,bass, piano, drums and a singer +backup. Our group was thinking of doing a compressed 4 person band at each gig rather than hauling 9 people stuff through a bar. How much do you think we should charge? We are college trained musicians but still playing for the community we a apart of, so we would like it to stay fair (money wise)on both sides.

(TLDR; college trained musicians questioning how much to charge at gigs) "
"We all l hate the idea of not being paid for ""exposure"", but looking to hear stories from people that have had a positive experience of playing for free.

No chance I'd play for free now, but my bands first ""gig"" was busking on the periphery of a local town festival. But busking that day for ¬£20 each led to about ¬£6000 of bookings by the next year and a half just from that on day."

"Just wanted to express my feelings about playing for the very last time at the church I‚Äôve attended my whole life.

I‚Äôm a (27M) guitarist, started playing when I was 13 and have only ever played at church, and tonight was the last time I played with the band. 

I started way from the bottom and I‚Äôve been band leader for about 3-4 years now. It‚Äôs bitter sweet bc tonight I played with the musicians I started out with and felt great to give it one last go together.

It‚Äôs beautiful to look back on all this years that have passed and seeing how much I‚Äôve taught to others even without trying. 

I hope I find another band where I‚Äôm going and hopefully I‚Äôll appreciate them as much as I‚Äôve done with the bands I‚Äôve played with at my church. 

Not a question but a musician being a bit sentimental.

"I‚Äôm writing a dissertation for my final college project on the impact of visual media on the music industry and I‚Äôd love to be able to interview some people via email. You don‚Äôt need to be an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù in this field as such, just have good knowledge on the topic. The questions are as follows:

Without visual media (i.e. tiktok, screens making concerts more interesting, websites etc), do you think music would have such a prevalence today?  

How have music videos and live visuals changed the way we experience popular music compared to, say, listening to the radio? 
 
Do you think visuals can make a song more popular, even if the music itself isn't that strong? 
 
Has the rise of streaming platforms like YouTube changed the expectations for how music should be presented? 
 
Do you think there may be a risk of visuals overshadowing the music entirely in the future?

"Hello. I am a 13 year old amateur pianist from Kazakhstan. I compose classical music and make music scores. I already composed plenty of pieces already. The problem arises when I want to publish my music. Minors cannot get paid by music distributors such as DistroKid, and even if I lie about my identity, one must withdraw their earnings from other apps, which require identification. I will drop that as an option unless there are other ways to earn money without needing verification. 

If I drop that as an requirement, I believe I get a lot more options to distribute music (Music Distributors that do not pay musicians).

"Hello!My band just got the invitation to hop on a tour as the direct support for a band for about a month. As we're trying to get everything figured out, would love to get your perspective on what vehicle works best.

It will be around 5 people traveling in total (3 band members, guitar, bass, drums, + 2 crew, luggage, and hella merch)

We have done shorter tours before, previously in a camper van w/ converted beds + trailer and had a lot of space left in the trailer.

&amp;#x200B;

We've traveled in a Sienna before for a weekend show and had a lot of space, but also we didn't bring the drum kit.

Do you think a smaller vehicle, like a Toyota Sienna or a Honda Odyssey would work? Or should I look more at a Ford Transit or Sprinter van?

I don't mind being a little cramped (plus, the sienna is like $2k for the month, vs a sprinter is more like $5k and worse on gas), but what worries me is that we start loading everything up and realize that we can't fit all our gear &amp; luggage in!

"So I‚Äôm a songwriter and acoustic guitarist, not much of a singer, and I mostly write for others to sing. I‚Äôm looking at getting in a studio down the road with one of my songs that is gaining traction, and maybe reworking it a little while in the studio to get it where I want it to be. I have zero experience with recording studios and even less with mixing, mastering and engineering, and I really don‚Äôt know how all that works. I have a musician friend who does not live in the same area as me but he has a home studio and he has been  recording the instrumental tracks. He sends them to me, and so far I‚Äôve been recording in my city with my singer friends using my little audio interface and DAW, which isn‚Äôt much and I don‚Äôt know but the basics on the DAW. But it has been okay for my purposes up until now. I also have a producer friend, also in a different city, who wants to come to town for about ten days and go in a studio with several different singers and possibly a band, although we could also use my musician friends tracks so I guess in that case would only need the singers in the studio. My musician friend is not able to travel and so unfortunately can‚Äôt be in the studio with us. So I guess we‚Äôll either be using his tracks or starting from scratch‚Ä¶I guess neither is ideal as he is familiar with the song already, so if we pulled in other musicians there would be more of a learning curve.  Anyway I‚Äôll be leaning on my producer friend to help with all of this, but I thought I‚Äôd put this out there to see what others experiences and advice might be on something like this, as I am very much a newbie. Thank you.

"I have a beautiful acoustic instrument that I‚Äôd love to get connected to an amp via a pick up mic of sorts, and play around with looping‚ÄîI get overwhelmed when it comes to figuring out what kind of equipment to get/where to start, any one have recommendations?"
"I'm a 19 year old bedroom musician and I just want so badly to be able to play gigs at restaurants for some cash every night. I have solid enough guitar and piano skills to play full sets of songs from memory and I can sing fairly well. Granted, I don't have the greatest voice, but I've seen plenty of guys as ok as I am do what I want to do. I play mostly folk/jazz/indie pop songs and some jazz standards. But in my area/city, the main style of live music places usually show is country, and I don't really play country. I'm also a non-white teenage girl; I don't really look like the typical older white country musicians who usually perform.

I've gone to open mics and I've performed in school shows, and I'm currently about to join my college's music theater department. I've wanted for a few years and I've tried to reach out to restaurants to play some gigs. I have my own amp, an electric and acoustic guitar, a mic, and a speaker for it. The problem is I don't really have any kind of professional profile. A video or two up on TikTok, but usually I send out video/mp3 files to whoever I want to convince. I'm polite and professional in conversation, but I have no website and no professional gigging experience to back me up.

Mostly I've just cold-called restaurants who I know have live music to ask if they're looking for musicians, but usually they either aren't looking, don't get back, or they hear me out but end up being unable to give me a gig. I've also contacted a local agent but they didn't get back to me after I sent them my info. I think they usually give half-hearted excuses, maybe because I'm not very good, but I genuinely think any semi-decent musician who just knows how to play enough likable songs would be able to do what I want to do. I think my problem is I just don't know how to establish a professional platform for myself. I don't know how this kind of gig industry works. I'm making this post for professional rather than skill advice. How do I get people to respond to me? What's the right method for reaching out to places for live music? Should I get an agent? How do I get an agent to hear me out? I know I should probably make a website, but what do I have to show for if I have no professional experience? Also, what's the right gear for solo gigs? Is what I have enough?

I don't want to be famous, I don't really even want to release my own music or be an artist, I just want to play local gigs and I don't know how. I don't have connections or music industry friends/family. But this is kind of my secret life dream. If I could just start playing at restaurants or coffee shops or anything, that would be enough for me. Advice would be really appreciated. Thanks."

"Hello everyone!! So I have a Scarlett 2i4 second gen for a while and I am looking for upgrading. I will try to explain my best while keeping it short. I have a Elektron Syntakt, a Roland SH-4D and a Akai MPC live. I also have a Arturia Keystep Pro and a Native Intruments Komplete Kontrol S61 Mk2. 

My idea is to have everything connected, through Ableton via MIDI, at any point for ease of use plus a microphone and a guitar. I was thinking about getting the Arturia Audiofuse Studio which would cover pretty much everything (inputs so I can have everything connected, 2 headphones out and MIDI connection plus the usb ports). In this way I can have everything connected to the same spot without having to fiddle with cables. However, the more I read the more I get scared of making a wrong buy mainly due to the audiofuse being usb 2.0 and the preamps not being good enough or have some noise. 

Therefore I have another option which would have to be a more long term accomplishment. I have been hearing great about the SSL 12 but it would be some what a compromise for me. The 4 extra inputs would be handy as well as the usb ports included in the Arturia. If I got the SSL 12, later on I would have to get an expansion(through ADAT possible) and maybe a good expansion to get the 8 inputs I would like to have would be the SSL PURE DRIVE QUAD (or maybe the OCTO)

It‚Äôs so much information that I am getting very confused so I am asking for the help of this wonderful community to bring me some clarity. Any more info that might be helpful please ask. Thank you in advance üôè"

"I'm in the scenario of being surrounded by ultra-realistic people who stopped living in the beauty of things, and play capitalism.  I play it too, but I don't let it affect me.  I am never the person that lashes out and puts my anxiety/frustration on others almost ever.

I've gotten to a point where now things are getting serious, I'm preparing for different scenarios, getting ready to treat this as a job.  

But people around me don't really show support.  In fact, I'm usually the emotional support and pusher, I'll get people art supplies, offer to buy drums, woodworking equipment, the whole spectrum.  People like my songs I'll send them, they'll like my live playing, but I don't think they understand where I want to go.  And it's not because I haven't communicated it, it's because it's not a realistic goal to some people.  They don't see a vision/goal because it seems cartoon-ish to them.  But I am just keyed into the world differently than them, BUT I respect their perspective and their realistic views.

But I'm hiding a lot of my progress from the past year, I'm like treating it like I'm doing heroin sometimes, just trying to get a hit and hide away sometimes.  I'm in a situation of JUST getting a new job after a few months, so I've had to hide a lot of things because of course ""why are you playing music when you should be looking for a job.""  All fair, makes sense.  But it's interesting to be stuck in a scenario of progress where you know you can only rely on yourself, and you need to hide your actual goals, because people will pounce on you if you were truly honest.  Again, I believe it's fair to criticize it, but on the other hand, it also sucks a tad to be surrounded by little positive influence. "

One of my friends has a small band and they are playing a little outdoor venue. It will be 2 singers who play guitar and keyboard, and one bassist who does not sing. This venue will not have a PA, so I am trying to think of the best way to go about making them sound good. We have 3 amps and we will have power, so I am thinking one amp for vocals, one for the keyboard, and one for the guitar+bass. Obviously this is not ideal but I think it should be better than nothing. Alternatively we could rent a PA system but I'm not super keen on spending the money to do that for this one gig. Am I on the right track here or way off? Any tips on positioning the amps would be great as well. Thanks so much in advance!!"

"Hi all-

I'm a 31-year-old musician and university student, and for whatever reason, I am struggling to find bandmates who want to jam or record here in Halifax, NS. I mostly record at home nowadays anyway, so as long as folks are set up to record at home and we can bounce tracks back and forth, why not explore who is out there on the web and see who is interested in writing/recording on a project together? My question for the group is, is there a place where I can find others looking to do this very thing?

"I'm not jealous - just frustrated :) It's frustrating to witness my friend's sudden rise to fame on TikTok. Overnight, he went from having 3K followers to a staggering 200K on Instagram and half a million on TikTok, with his Spotify garnering 10 million listeners and reaching the number 1 spot on global charts. 

I am genuinely pleased to see my friend experience this success because his songs are great. I am just frustrated and feeling hopeless because this success seemed entirely random; his song went viral without much effort or consistency on his part - he made the song, hasn't really been posting much TikToks and doesn't know much about marketing; just posted a TikTok (nothing special) and it popped off. While you may suggest it's an attestation that his success means others can do it too.. it's disheartening seeing other artists including this friend who have some other OUTSTANDING songs, market them so much, put so much effort into writing/production/marketing... and nothing happens. 

It feels like success in the music industry boils down to luck so much.... leaving us feeling demotivated and overlooked despite our efforts.

Anyone felt the same? Any advice?"

I am over 18 but I'm considered a dependent on my parent's taxes. They don't know I'm making music and it's super complicated. I didn't feel good about just asking a friend to use their bank account just for my music, until I got an idea. A close friend of mine has been in financial troubles and needs money to move out of a non trans-friendly state. So I talked with her about if she would let me help her by having her get the royalties I earn which I didn't mind. She insisted I get at least a little bit of the money so we agreed on a 75% 25% split, in which she would get most of the money. Only problem is that I'm not sure if this would cause legal troubles. If her information is put into the account, would there still be a problem?"

I am about to open a bar and I am just wondering about the booking process for musicians these days. Are there any good platforms out there or is it more word-of-mouth?

"Hey, I‚Äôm a professional guitarist who recently started training backing vocals. And the next day after I practiced I had this strain in my vocal chords(especially when I look up I can feel it). 
 
So basically I was wondering is it a thing that will fade out(like after a few days of working out) after the first few times. Or do I need to pace myself better during practice routines or put more minutes into warming up rather. Is this a concerning thing, if so what can I do to improve it, or is it normal?
 
 Also if it is a factor do I need to quit smoking? Because I actually am one."

"I started practicing music when I was little, I started with piano. In that time I learned much about music theory. But only 3 months ago I started with music production, using fl studio 20 (now 21) and I am learning every day. What made it a lot easier for my is that I already got the theoretical knowledge. The only challenge I face evertime I start producing is converting what I think into an actual idea. My biggest problem right now is my sound selection, which at the current time I have to spend most time on in order to sound decent. I was pretty lucky to meet some more experienced music producers who would teach me some stuff, making my learning progress faster.

My newest ambient single is about to be released and I am really proud of it. It is really nice to listen to and the mix sounds good on every device I tried (I tried a lot).

"One more band I love a lot, an underrated song from a perfect album. Facelift is my favourite alice in chains album.

I feel that this one is similar to black sabbath, classic heavy metal. Great in every aspect, Layne was a killer apart from the bass on this one.

Where it is common for the bassists to follow the guitars, on this song, Mike follows the drum for most of the part, even the bass fills complement the drum fills. It has a damn perfect rhythm. Mike is one of the biggest inspirations and one of my favourite bassists. He has a multilayered style of playing and is a multidimensional bassists with so nany weapons in his arsenal, can play with a finger, a pick, can slap and his usage of chords and slides are godly.

Not much of a challenge for an AIC song, just memorizing the changing bass fills maybe. Figured out the tabs by isolating the bass from the mix.

Genre - Grunge / Heavy Metal 
Original Bassist - Mike Starr
From the album 'Facelift'

"1. Depreciation: Your guitar‚Äôs value drops by about 1/3 the moment that you purchase it and leave the store with it. You can post that SG Standard for $1200 and refuse to budge, but nobody is going to buy it from you. They‚Äôll just buy a brand new one.
2. Obscurity vs rarity: You have a model that was only manufactured for one year? Cool. That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make it rare and valuable. My 2014 SGJ is definitely obscure and hard to find. It‚Äôs still only worth about $650. I audibly laugh when I see people post them for $900 knowing that they‚Äôre not very good guitars and were available for only $500 brand new. Same goes for Airline, Kay, Harmony and either dirt cheap vintage guitars people think are worth $1,000 just because they‚Äôre old.
3. Aftermarket parts: I don‚Äôt care if you spent $6 million on parts. They‚Äôre useless in the guitar value wise. If you want money for them, take them out and sell them separately. Regardless of what you paid, nobody is going to pay you near retail value for the aftermarket parts in your guitar ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôve ruined a high end USA made guitar with unnecessary ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù.
4. Vintage: Your vintage gear is only valuable if it‚Äôs all original. If you‚Äôve painted it, changed  parts, etc it is now just a regular guitar with no special value.
5. Selling an expensive guitar with no case is like selling grenades with the pins removed.
6. Headstock repairs: Headstock repairs cut the instrument‚Äôs price in half. Your Les Paul was worth $2,000 brand new. The second you left the store with it, it was worth $1,400. The second you broke the headstock, the value dropped to $700. I don‚Äôt care if Jesus Christ himself did the headstock repair. It‚Äôs a $700 guitar.

As a general rule when selling ANYTHING, it‚Äôs almost definitely worth 20%-25% less than what you think it‚Äôs worth.

"In today's digital music age, building a loyal fanbase is crucial for sustained success.
The primary purpose of an entertainer is to entertain their audience. If they don‚Äôt have a loyal fan base to entertain, the artist either isn‚Äôt entertaining or just hasn‚Äôt found the people who will enjoy them.

As a professional songwriter with over a decade of experience helping fellow artists navigate their careers, I‚Äôve witnessed firsthand the evolving landscape of the music industry. In this era dominated by social media and streaming platforms, success is now more about capturing and retaining audience attention, fostering genuine connections, and building a loyal fanbase.

Here are some key strategies to foster fan loyalty:

- Know Your Audience:
Invest time in understanding your fans' brand preferences, habits, motivations, values, etc Utilize analytics tools and direct feedback to gain insights into what resonates with them and tailor your approach accordingly. You should have a concrete idea of who your average fan is and what their specific interests are.

- Know Your Value: 
People engaged with content or listen to music to be entertained and validated. Know what entertains them and do it consistently to build loyalty. Being a successful artist is a happy balance between self expression and giving fans with what they want.

- Collaborate Wisely: 
Partner with influencers or fellow artists who share your audience to broaden your reach and credibility. Collaborative projects and cross-promotions can introduce your music to new fans while strengthening your connection with existing ones.

Stop looking for step-by-step guides, hacks, and quick results. Building fan loyalty is a gradual process that requires patience, content that entertains those people specially, and consist follow through. No matter what. Get curious about your ideal fans and what make them tick. Then entertain them!

Feel free to comment with follow up questions. Good luck!"

"Hello everyone! I just wanted to introduce myself. My name is James, and I am a blues pianist. I am self taught and have been playing piano for 17 years. I never had a lesson, I was just inspired and wanted to be a pianist more than anything. 

Around 18 I started to love the Blues genre. My best friend introduced me to Stevie Ray Vaughan and i was hooked. So anyway, I got accepted to my music program in my university, and I just wanted to show you this little improvisation I did in their band room. I am very informal when it comes to reading music and music theory, so taking this plunge into proper music is a bit intimidating. 

I was hoping you guys could tell me what you think of my style.

Is it worthwhile to buy a better microphone to record the sound?

Can I get one that will connect to the i-phone so the i-phone will use it instead of it's built-in mic?

I want to avoid recording the audio and video separate and having to sync them up in a different program. Would like a simple set up, set it and forget it, maybe ask my girlfriend to babysit it during the show.

"I am currently in a band that has no real goals outside of playing at local bars.  It's totally fine.  I am a rhythm guitarist for the group, while my band member is the lead guitarist as well as the lead singer.  He's very difficult to work with.  He won't listen to my ideas, as well as the others.  He comes up with the setlists himself and doesn't ask for our input.  And above all else, he is very condescending whenever we provide an audio clip of us playing or practicing in person.  Always says things like ""oh, that's good bud.  A little slower than the original but not bad.""  I also asked if I could play a few piano songs on my keyboard, showed him a song.

As this record was generously funded by Arts Council England, I'll be giving away digital copies of the album for free; be sure to subscribe to my Bandcamp to recieve notifications when tracks from Microcosms are published.

Microcosms came about through a realisation I'd been living until the age of 27 with far-sightedness.

"So i play alot of instruments...drums, percussion, piano, bagpipes, bass, guitar, ukelele, snare, anything i can hit

I have played instruments ever since i was little, and i am honestly sure playing instruments is my hyperfixiation.

So naturally i want to play more,  however i just cannot decide between Trumpet and Tenor Sax as my next adventure.

I want to play both for the same reason, jazz i have had an interest in saxophone ever since i was a little kid thanks to one of my classmates, but my parents never allowed me because they hate the saxophone with a passion, now i'm 23 and no longer care about what they think of my choice of instruments (as you can see from the bagpipes)

But trumpet also greatly interests me thanks to things like jazz, Chet baker, Lucky Chops.

Trumpet would be the cheaper option as we have a trumpet at home because my father played trumpet when he was in the airforce and it still works fine.

So yeah TLDR i can't decide on my next instrument : D"

The reasons for wanting a ukulele is for more portable play and a different sound and also because of Israel ‚ÄúIZ‚Äù Kamakawiwo‚Äôole and my love for his music.

The reasons for wanting a kalimba is for the melodic sound, because it‚Äôs something different and because of my favourite track/song by Jarrad Wright ‚Äúflying dream‚Äù (if you haven‚Äôt listened to him before I would highly recommend).

"I am in the youth group of my church, and every year the youth takes over for a service. Last year, the worship group had no drummer and it sounded weird (yes, I know that the music is not the important thing of church but you know what I mean). So this year, I decided to sign up. I've had my electric drum set for a few years, and I took it seriously for about 6 months, watching lessons and reading stuff out of a book, and have only been doing freestyle stuff for the most part now. I also do not play to worship music (contemporary christian), mainly just doing rock or a little bit of jazz stuff. Any tips on how to approach this? I'm just worried because my playing has just been playing along and having fun, so I don't even know if it is good, and also I have never played for or with anyone."

"The more I put my music out on social media, the more I run into this. Some folks will go out of their way to comment on my videos to say that the performance or the music sucks. I try to pay attention to all the other positive and uplifting comments I get, which are the majority, but these hateful ones tend to affect me regardless. 

I just want to understand what kind of person thinks like that. If I‚Äôm on social media and see an artist I don‚Äôt like, I don‚Äôt immediately get the urge to comment on their video letting them know I hate their music. I just scroll past it. I never wanna bring down someone who‚Äôs making themselves vulnerable and creating things for others. I don‚Äôt understand what goes through these people‚Äôs minds to make them wanna do that. I know big artists get hate all the time, but how must you‚Äôve been feeling inside to wanna comment that kind of stuff on a small artist‚Äôs feed? Like truly, what irks you to spend a minute of your day bringing someone down? "
"Do you feel like having beats/loops/demos stolen is a huge problem we face in the music industry?

"Bandleader here. We're a pretty active band in our area and play lots of local and regional shows. Originals only - not a cover band. Genre is indie/shoegaze. I invest lots of my personal funds and time into the band: recording, physical record/CD production, marketing, buying merch, etc. The other band members do not put money into the band, and I don't ask them to. People like our band, and we have good attendance at shows. We also make money from tickets/cover charges and merch, but not a ton. I keep detailed accounting and we're perpetually in the red. My understanding is that this is the normal state of financial affairs for bands like ours.

My question is whether I should be paying the other band members with what we make at shows. They've told me they just love being in the band and are doing it for fun, but I know similar bands in our area DO pay members after shows. What's the etiquette here? Should I be paying the guys?

I'm not trying to be a Scrooge. And honestly, there's no money to Scrooge over. From a financial standpoint, the band is literally just a big debt I carry. There are no profits. All the money we've earned has gone back into the band. Should I pay the members nonetheless? I just want to do the right thing here.

EDIT: Thanks for the responses! I've decided to start splitting compensation for shows among the performing band members."

"Hey there fellas
I first started using ditto and it was ok, but now that i learn more and more about business side of music i am getting more and more disappointed. I feel like i got no tools on ditto and their publishing service does absolutely nothing. To top it off, they are taking too long to send music to stores and now i am less than 24 hours from my next release i still haven't got my smart link (pre save link) and it is still not reflected in my Spotify for artists daahboard.
So. Here is the question.
I have been eyeing the Music Gateway portal and i like their sync licensing and tools available to grow.
But i also have some music friends using Distrokid. 
What is your insight regarding these platforms? Any insight would be much appreciated. 
Much love and darkness"
"I guess I‚Äôm trying to figure out why other musicians enjoy playing their music live. What are the honest reasons that performing gives you fulfillment. I‚Äôm newer to recording music and have found a ton of catharsis and enjoyment in recording and producing my own music, as well as collaborations (via file sharing). I‚Äôm in a group with 3 men and none of them seem to mind playing out and they even enjoy it. I have extreme social anxiety, and I am a working wife and mom of 2 young kids and while we don‚Äôt play out often, it‚Äôs such a drag for me to cut my work schedule, find a sitter, lugging gear around, be out late, etc‚Ä¶on top of hating performing and only being comfortable in my studio alone with my laptop. I‚Äôm about to throw in the towel and tell them I don‚Äôt want to do any more live shows (we‚Äôve only done 3 and have a 4th coming up next week). But I don‚Äôt want to be a party crasher and basically kill our live presence since I‚Äôm a bit of the main feature in our band by contributing vocals and multiple instruments and providing the structure of our set. Please tell me some positives you get from it. Bonus is you‚Äôre a mom too:)"

"I'm about 6 months out from releasing a new single. Our last release was in 2018 and MUCH has changed, so I'm trying to absorb as many FREE helpful resources as possible. So far, I've listened to:

* Podcasts **(Music Bi Weekly, Music Marketing Manifesto**, and **Music Industry Blueprint**)
* Read **Two Story Melody** blog posts
* Plan to watch **Jesse Cannon** and **Two Story Media's YouTube videos**

Are there any other FREE resources you would recommend that you've found most helpful when planning a release? Our goals are to increase Spotify plays and listeners, Facebook page reach, Instagram followers and engagement, and TikTok followers and views.

We're preparing to release a single a month for a while instead of an album all at once to regain online engagement. We're less focused on money funnels at the moment, though planning to do an email marketing funnel, using a free download as the incentive. We've already started posting consistent social media content on FB, Insta, and TikTok. We were very active 2012-2018, so we have a TON of content in our back catalog.

Thanks in advance for your help!"

"After studying music for many years and graduating my music bachelor, I find myself wishing I‚Äôd done something else. 

I see my peers go viral, get playlisted, get radio play and playing gigs every week. I constantly stalk their numbers and see how mine are barely existent.

I truly believe my art and music is good enough, but I lack the willpower and nerve to put myself out there enough. I have tried my best to network but due to not being a conventionally attractive girl in the industry I struggle immensely to connect on a authentic level as they are superficial. 

This is no excuse but I am very alone in the world as I only have my brother and friends (my family isn‚Äôt in my life). I have never had a stable place to call home and I long for a peace and love I lack right now feeling like a failure next to my amazing peers. I don‚Äôt know if I should keep going or accept that I don‚Äôt want to give more of myself as it‚Äôs making me unhappy as of now.

EDIT:
Thank you for all the lovely replies. This morning I started missing the fun of writing songs and remembered why I even started doing music to begin with. All the different opinions and stories you have commented reminded me that being born with a creative drive is something beautiful, and regardless the outcome it‚Äôs a talent we should celebrate wether it‚Äôs alone in the rehearsal room or in front of a big crowd. I finally sat down and made a new playlist (it‚Äôs been 1 year since my last) and suddently I feel a little more alive again. I had forgotten how amazing it feels to discover new music‚Ä¶

In two weeks I have my final exam concert, a 40 min set with all my original work. I worked so hard and made a team of my band, strings, sax, dancers and a choir. I‚Äôll cherish the performance and be proud of doing what I always longed for.ü•π"
"I'm a young prog musician (only 17), and have been posting onto social media fairly regularly for the past year, or so: I had to change accounts at one point, due to an invasion of privacy, and on the music account have only amassed 87 followers, most of whom are all people I know.

I consistently see people my age or younger, often less skilled (not to seem arrogant) with far more reach and attention, and was wondering how I can further engage other musicians future fans.

I don't have a means by which to record music at home, with no audio interface, DAW, etc, but I write consistently, post (sometimes infrequently), and yet seem to have little to no growth. Recently I saw a huge influx of non-followers reached, yet few engaged with my content.

Do you guys know of any ways to do this, and to keep people engaged for future release of music?"
"Background: I am an upright bassist/electric bassist/singer-songwriter/guitarist.

I have usually played with a band, sometimes fronting, sometimes as just the bassist, but never a solo show. 

I was told it was on a Saturday, from 12-4. I gave her (my colleague who first asked me, ""What do you charge?)"" samples of my singing and playing bass.

She seemed interested but I didn't have any recordings of me doing covers, just my originals.

I figure I would mostly be singing and playing funk/r&amp;b guitar. I do have a loop pedal that might expand my sound, though I am still new to using it.

Anyway, wondering what is reasonable to charge if it's just me? I don't know yet how long I would be expected to play, but I imagine it's at least two sets."

"So I have already played multiple instruments when growing up. I first played the piano until elementary school. Then I switched to orchestra and private lessons in middle school and beginning of highschool . Then I started playing guitar mid-highschool till the beginning of last year when I decided to stop cause I couldn't juggle both classes at the lessons. 

I am kinda having a crisis and I would like to refund myself and start enjoying doing stuff again instead of just consuming content, and I miss just playing music. 

However I just feel tired and just do other stuff that is menial and low effort. I feel like I can't find the energy to do anything meaningful (which is another issue by itself but related to my want to play again.)

I am also considering what I should play. I don't have a piano or keyboard anymore, my violin was a rental. I just have the guitar now. Idk if I should play a new instrument or just do one that I have played before.

So I guess I have a few questions. How do you keep yourself motivated to play an instrument? And how did you choose what instrument you wanted to play? "
"So I‚Äôm a drummer with a decent few years live experience.

Supported Tame Impala once!

However my second instrument is guitar. I‚Äôm pretty mediocre at it.

Soon I might want to play my songs live on guitar. Would be a band context so not just me.

Thing is I used to get quite nervous before gigs.

And the idea of guitar live terrifies me. Mild shaking before a gig? Not a big deal with drums. But guitar? Another story. Some of my songs are mostly strumming others are arpeggiated kind of riffs Johnny Marr style. 

These are so easy to mess up if shaking or overthinking or having self defeating negative thoughts. I have many of these because I am an OCD and anxiety sufferer. But it‚Äôs my dream for my music to reach an audience and play live.

Any advice specific to playing guitar live as a stage fright sufferer, would be so appreciated."

"Hey, folks. I have a 6 month old daughter. I would like her to have access to a small assortment of well-made, child-appropriate instruments. This could be instruments of any kind: string, wind, percussion. I'm thinking of 1/2 guitars, small hand drums, small keyboards, recorders.

While some of those wouldn't work for a 6 month, I was hoping over time, having access to them as she grows and learns would go along way in helping her develop a musical mind.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. "

"OK so I'm a teen aspiring artist (15yrold) and I've been playing drums on and off for about a year, I'm slowly starting to play again and improving but I really want other people to play with outside of school. I don't care how good we are or anything I just want to make some friends to make some shitty music with and have a laugh but idk how I'm gonna find the people for that. I've tried watching YouTube videos but they don't sound very practical and I'm not looking for experienced players, improving with other people would be very beneficial for me since I'm self-taught and can't afford lessons.

Also I'm not picky to genre either so I don't mind playing a genre that other people like, so there's no creative difference between members.

Could anyone help with advice? Or is it just a natural occurrence?"

I just want to replay them to self-critique our live show. I've tried recording a few times with the built-in mic and Voice Recorder app and it came out OK once, but otherwise has always been unintelligible distortion. I realize placement of the phone has alot to do with the resulting quality, but I figure a slight upgrade in the setup (particularly something with gain control) would help alot. Thanks!"

I'm a Berklee Alumnus and I have been licensing my own music, and teaching other musicians how to do the same, for 15 years.

I've decided to change my focus this year and give away a ton of resources I used to charge for, in the spirit of giving back and helping other musicians reach their goals.

I'm starting with my flagship course, The Ultimate Music Licensing Guide. It's a four-hour audio/video course that I used to sell for 77 dollars, but I've had a pretty big epiphany recently about how I can better serve the music community and so I'm giving this and a lot of other resources away for free.

"Hey guys,

I have a question: I have been using the music distributor ""LevelMusic"" for months and everything has worked without any problems in the past. Since the beginning of the year, however, there have been problems with the payout. This also applies to many other artists, as there have been a lot of bad reviews on Truspilot since the beginning of 2024. This is due to the fact that support only writes back after months or does not pay out the funds. I have now been in contact with ""Spotify for Artist"" and they have suggested that we switch to another distributor. But now my question is: If I transfer my songs over to another distributor, will my royalties still be counted? Currently, only a small part from December and January is counted. Only the US streams and not the streams from the Netherlands (or EU). Could you help me with this question?

"So basically I have a wedding gig booked in late August and I‚Äôm playing for my cousins son who is getting married. I put together a band and asked one of the band members if he could give me a list of 20-30 songs that he knows and I also asked if he would be willing to learn any extra tunes (if requested by the bride and groom). 

He told me that I was ‚Äúputting too much work into it‚Äù and only gave me a list of 15 tunes. He also said he wasn‚Äôt willing to learn any extra tunes for ‚Äúonly one show.‚Äù

I was kind of shocked by his response, because I‚Äôve played many shows where I‚Äôve been asked to learn new songs, and my list of songs that I know is at least 50+ songs, so I feel like 20-30 songs really wasn‚Äôt that big of an ask.

Really, I just don't know where to start. I live in a relatively big city, so there can be many potential options. I don't know if I should start performing (or where), or if there are other ways I can start to build the foundations for a future career in the music industry.

"I just put out my first album a couple days ago. Did the whole thing myself and was a long, tiring process but really happy with the turn out in every way.

I was thinking I‚Äôd need time away or to recharge a bit from writing, recording, demoing but I carry on a have a decent amount of new material already. 

Do you think there should be time taken away from these things to recharge? If you have put out a few projects and have a routine, what is that routine/ turn around to the next project/ album. Do you find yourself not as inspired if you start on another project right away after coming off the last one?

"Hi all! I live in an area with a really booming art/music scene. I‚Äôm super active and I host pretty successful art shows once a month in my area. 

I know a lot of small local bands and had an idea to do a battle of the bands to kick off summer but I wanted some advice. 

I‚Äôve heard a lot of mixed things about these types of events and want it to be fun for all without it being a slimy money grab.

I was thinking it be free for bands to enter and give about 15-20 minutes between bands to set up/soundcheck etc. is that enough time?

I‚Äôll be having a group of local art vendors participate in the event and help contribute to prize baskets for the bands. What else should be included in prizes?

I was thinking of doing $7 pre-order tickets and $10 door tickets and paying the venue 10% of proceeds. Should there be an adjustment to the percentage?

I‚Äôd love to hear any of your experiences and know what you would like to see out of this type of event! I think it could be really fun and any advice is appreciated!

"I'm in a small city with lots of pubs but only one dedicated live music venue. 

There's one local promoter who puts on free shows (with several acts on the bill) every week at a bar, plus he does a few 'weekenders' during the year, with lots of bands/duos/soloists performing across a couple of days. I would say it's like a hobby/obsession for him that he doesn't seek to profit from.

Lots of musicians like him and appreciate his contribution to keeping the local scene alive. However, Recently I've started to feel pissed off that he holds such a monopoly over local music, to the extent that it's very hard to get a paid gig - because why would people pay when there's free live music every week? 

I saw him ranting on social media about our city's one dedicated live venue where bands play ticketed shows, like he resents the fact that musicians want to get paid - and I am keen to distance myself from this. I believe he thinks we're friends and - although I am grateful for the musical opportunities - he has overshared stuff with me before that I wasn't comfortable with.

In the past I have turned down a slot on another local promoter's radio show because it's someone he has a rivalry with and I wanted to stay on the free promoter's good side. Now I'm returning to local live performance and I want to make it clear that I am a professional and not interested in this guys petty personal beefs if it disadvantages my exposure. 

Do you think this ""big fish, small pond"" mentality is a common thing with local music promoters? How do I stay neutral without seeming aloof?"

"I had recently started dating this girl, and she was interested in hearing my music. I invited her to an open mic on Valentine‚Äôs Day, 2018, where I would play one of my older songs and a new one that I had just written‚Äîfor her.

The person who played before me was a crowd favorite, so that amped up the pressure. But no problem‚Äîmy stuff is good too. I‚Äôll get up there and prove myself. I‚Äôll amaze this girl with the beauty of my music.

So I get up there‚Ä¶and crumble.

I couldn‚Äôt get accustomed to the mic. My pitch sounded bad‚Äîvery, very bad. I had some false starts. I kept forgetting chords and lyrics. The best parts of these songs flopped badly. The audience was clearly unmoved and disinterested. By the end of the ordeal, my face was beet red and I was sweating. Of course, the audience clapped politely. I‚Äôm sure they pitied me and felt my embarrassment‚Äîwhich kind of made it worse.

And my date? She had to leave shortly thereafter. And then she ghosted me.

It took me 5 years to get back on stage.

Anyone else have any horror stories?"
