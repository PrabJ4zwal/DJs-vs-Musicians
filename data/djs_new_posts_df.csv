2,The zoom H4 essential is a great device for recording your mixes,2,1cet0ja,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1cet0ja/the_zoom_h4_essential_is_a_great_device_for/,1,"I just wanted to come on here and share my experience because I've seen a lot of posts on here asking how to record mixes and use a recorder but having issues with the recordings clipping. 

I have a xone 96 which has a record out option via rca so I initially started with the zoom h1 essentials. Turns out the 3.5mm mic line in isn't built to handle the level of audio you get from a mixer unless you use an attenuator, which I did end up getting one but I had to babysit the levels on the mixer and keep them at around 0db otherwise it would still clip or get fairly close so I ended up returning it and getting the zoom h4 essential.

This thing has been so great. It has 1/4 line input which is built to handle audio from the mixer. I just plug it from the record out on my mixer directly to the h4e with an rca to dual 1/4 input, hit record and play my set as normal. Don't have to worry about setting levels on the device and can push the gain to the upper levels on the mixer without the recording clipping.

This thing is so convenient, no more lugging my laptop around to record sets, just plug n play. Audio is great, I should have went with this one in the first place.",1714262951.0

I could have gone home to grab it, but decided to give dj pro a try cause I had all the required adaptors, and had a decent collection of music still on my iPhone 12 Pro Max. I was djing off a Rane 72 and a single Rane Twelve and it was pretty flawless.


Plus there’s tidal support, which btw, I haven’t updated to the dj plan yet and it still worked - with stems and everything.

Low key restaurant gig so no real pressure but I did play for 4.5 hour. I haven’t used the program since like 2020

And holy shit did this program perform! 

I’m a serato dj through and through - and have been using the software since 2007 and I figured it out pretty quickly despite not using it in 4 years.

There a couple key features that I miss from Serato, and a few performance/design/mapping issues that bugged me, but i was really impressed by the overall experience.

I definitely enjoyed it more than playing o cdjs and even the denon gear.

I’ve been hoping a dvs standalone solution that I thought would be in the form of a mixer with usb support, but I think djay pro is going to be the equivalent of usbs and cdjs for turntable/dvs djs.

Now don’t get me wrong, the E8’s are super crystal clear and honest which is perfect for Production but for DJ’ing I always feel like all these monitors there just something missing, it doesn’t have that sort of rich immersive sound lim looking for. 

So I took the E8’s and connected them to my iMac and they will be used for production only.

So I went to a mates get together the other weekend and he had a older Hi-Fi Yamaha Surround sound hooked up to his DJ setup and I was like “Yehhh this is what I’ve been looking for” 

So my question is, I’ve decided to go down the Hifi route, I’ve seen these Sony Muteki type systems on Marketplace going for cheap but is there a setting on these amps to bypass the DSP so I can avoid any latency and lag? Or does someone know straight off the bat which one these Sony amps models/year/make that has direct through sound to avoid the latency/lag problem?

One of the things you get to learn obviously is how people get themselves on the bill. And we’re talking here just your good local venues not big warehouse project nights or touring events.

Everyone gets in different ways. Very common to see people running events who put the same three mates on everytime, I get it. Another is maybe the venue owner puts their friends on every weekend, not many else get a look in. I get that. And then the rest of us are left to just put ourselves out there in hopes or  through becoming known slowly you get an opportunity to showcase your stuff at event once in a while. 

One I don’t understand is how sometimes there’s like that one guy who’s on every single event poster. Like every single one. I know loads of good DJs who aren’t getting this much play time in the local scene. Like are they just impeccably good at networking like what’s going on that everyone wants them on their thing?

17,PSA to clean out your playlists/collection (also hit me with your organization tips!),12,1cd2aih,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1cd2aih/psa_to_clean_out_your_playlistscollection_also/,5,"This is obviously basic info, but I've been doing some housekeeping in Rekordbox and it's so rewarding! I'd love to get some insights and tips on how you keep things organized!

I play (very) open format and have been building my Rekordbox collection since I started in 2017. In the early stages I had the approach that it's better to have too much music for my 4hr set, and still I kept running out of songs to fit the vibe. So the collection kept building.

Some of my playlists have been big umbrella lists like ""Everything Hiphop"" or ""Everything 80s"" playlists. These last few years though I've been avoiding browsing those 1000 song lists while playing because they're just overwhelming and fruitless. So instead I stick to my newer, more specific playlists, e.g. ""Lo-fi House"" or ""Latin Disco"".

I realized there were an astonishing number of tracks I've never even played since 2017, which can be either reasonable or unfortunate. So I've started going through all the songs with 0 plays (then 1, 2 etc.) in my playlists and removing a whole lot of meh songs from the collection which were really just added in fear of running out of music. Some get to stay but in some other playlist, some get updated with new tags etc.

It feels so inspiring knowing that there are a lot less filler tracks in there and that the songs are in the playlist they belong! It's a never-ending work of course, but it's so worth it.

I know it’s a tale as old as time and will always be a part of the industry/culture, but, for those of us that just love music and the craft and don’t need substances to find joy in sharing music you love with others, how did you differentiate yourself? 

To me, hiding my identity makes it more believable that I’m in it for the music and I don’t need to worry about always maintaining appearances/looking cool for instagram. Also I feel like so much of the discourse around music revolves around identity politics these days which to me (queer POC) still feels backwards. Music is one of the most powerful tools of unity we have as a species - it’s a truly universal language! Yet it feels like we often use it as a means of exclusion and ego/status. 

It’s one of the things I’ve always admired most about daft punk (I know their faces are out there but to most people who were unfamiliar with their faces but loved their music, daft punk could have been anyone) and other similar artists, although in recent times, it’s turned into a bit of a gimmick.

* DJ was working on a transition but everytime he was about to blend the new track in, the original track skipped, causing the tracks to no longer play in sync. He then immediately cut away the new track, beatmatched it and then tried again. Original track kept skipping. Above happened 3-4 times. Eventually he just pressed the stop button of the original track, let the track come to a full brake and just started the new record from the beginning. Despite the 'fuck up' the crowd was cheering a lot!
* Can't find a link on youtube so excuse the facebook link, but [this](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=299175728054417) needle skip fix by Fjaak is really cool. They just hit the turntable at the right time causing the needle to hop over the skipping point.

39,Reloop Tape 2 Transfer...Recorded but with NO Audio???,0,1caosba,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1caosba/reloop_tape_2_transferrecorded_but_with_no_audio/,6,"Hi y'all,

Has this happened to anyone with the Reloop Tape 2???

I recorded a set on my DJM900 Nexus with the Reloop tape 2. The levels were fine (according to the Signal light, and the Record light was flashing normally), and I'm sure I set it up correctly. I've used it many times.

However, this time I went to transfer my 3hr set from the device to the computer and when i uploaded it into Audacity, I see there is NO sound--no waveform.

But it still recorded the 3 hours because the two files are around 2GB and around 250MB. 

I double checked the input gain on the Reloop, and it was at an appropriate level, and the Signal/Peak light was green whenever i looked at it throughout the set.

Is it possible that the audio is SOMEWHERE inside the Reloop's mini SD and i just need to...find it??? Or is it lost and I just need to accept it?

(I think i'm done with my Reloop Tape two and ready for a Tascam...but I'd really love to have the recording of my set if it's possible!).",1713826523.0

Every time I post questions about using Rekordbox or Virtual DJ in combination with Pioneer or Denon DJ controllers that have a screen i get the same answer:

""You shouldn't use a laptop. Use the screen on the controller.""

But I absolutely hate using that screen. My personal reason is that with my dyslexia a laptop is already hard enough to read and type. Reading and typing on a controller is absolutely exhausting for me. It's just one wall of words. Also, i mistype a lot and in an laptop it's so much easier to correct spelling mistakes. I would spend more time finding a song than actually on reading the crowd 

Plus I don't think the screens on controllers don't have the technological features a laptop has

The event organizer has requested that I set up amidst the trees and provide a lively soundtrack to keep the runners motivated as they pass by—think cheering, name-calling through the mic, the whole nine yards.

However, there's a challenge: there's no power source I can connect to. I have a Soundboks speaker and DDJ FLX4 that are easily carried to the spot I'm supposed to be in (can't get there by car).

Now, here's where I could use some advice: Is there a way for me to link up the controller with the speaker without a power outlet? Through the battery? Perhaps via a phone or iPad to the controller? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",1713798729.0

Here is the argument:  When the uncompressed version of the track is played with the big speakers, some of the inaudible frequencies that are cut for the mp3 may be felt *physically* *different* in the uncompressed versions when played with proper speakers.

According to this idea, with the uncompressed music, the massaging /thumping sensation of bass and other physical aspects of the overall music is enhanced. So with the mp3s part of this *physical sensation* may be lost. This means that you hear the same sounds with mp3, but *might* *feel* less of it throughout the rest of your body.

So for the people who are willing to do this, it is of utmost importance to pretend that your ears do not exist. Try to feel the music only with the rest of your body, do the bass, the highs, the mids of the track feel somewhat *physically* different when you perceive their vibrations in wav or aiff vs mp3 formats?

So the question is, i have probably around 2k€ (2.1k$) to invest into new gear. 
Should i buy Technics, which probably will run me 1k per piece and opt for more less fancy mixer, break little bit of my back financially, but then be happy with my workhorse, which will probably last me for the next lifetime.

OR

Opt out with Audio Technicas or Pioneer PLX-500/1000, which will be cheaper, and also buy a fancier mixer with leftover money?

I’ve been thinking more about the other side of djing, the social status/ clout chasing element. I feel like I just don’t understand it. No one likes to talk about it, but it really does feel like a popularity contest when we really get down to it. Some djs are more artistically motivated than others. But it’s impossible to ignore the forces at work. There are so many young kids just looking for attention and social status and to party with famous hot people. Obviously there are little pockets in each scene where people try to filter out that energy and enjoy a more communal experience that values authenticity. When we get more into the commercial side of the scene, obviously streaming numbers and ticket sales are what make the difference. But what about the less commercial side of djing? Is it more based on who you know? Or how long you’ve been around? How do you get your foot in the door when you’re just a normal dude without a huge following or critical acclaim? Do local venues just see how many followers you have on IG and decide like that?",1713744855.0

please also mention if you generally play in particular styles/genres and if you mean in a bar/club context 



i’ve been playing regularly at this local bar which has a nice energetic atmosphere and a chunky sub (an RCF system - a bit ‘pointy’ to my ears, but gets things done:) generally i like to start around crunchy instrumental hip hop tempos and then into 105-115 funky crunchy electronic beats (breaks, house, techno, electro and disco)…. and then i like to move around, jumping between 120-135 (doing sections of them). and i enjoy dipping into some 140, both straighter and more dubstep leaning (i mean proper more mnml dubstep). and if the night calls for some 150bpm madness and some footwork/jungle, all the better!

anyway…. im wondering if im spending too much time in hip hop tempo….? i’ve noticed i could use more tunes around 110bpm

these sets are (unfortunately) being played on CDJ-350s (i have & love my 2000s and Technics at home). 350s are fucking difficult to ‘make a story’ with. the displays suck, like playing on a calculator. but the gigs are fun once a vibe has been built:) i’ll always improvise in these gigs, which keeps things interesting (for me, anyway!). tonight i blended Kraftwerk with some Norwegian abstract house (if i remember correctly). about 40 years of electronic music in 7 mins? 😎

just curious what others do to build a vibe 😎

I consider myself a beginner DJ because I only really started DJing back in September 2023. I use Virtual DJ with a DDJ200 mainly because I come from a lower class family and don't really have the money to get Serato or upgrade my equipment. I've played at school events, a few birthday parties and at some cafes/ lounges and people always say I'm good at DJing. My friend hired me for my biggest gig yet a few weeks ago, a yacht party which was earlier today.

So I reached there half an hour early to set up. One thing to note is that when I've needed to use my own equipment at venues where a controller isn't provided, because the DDJ 200 doesn't have audio output, I always carry a 3.5mm to dual 1/4 inch splitter with me that I connect through my laptop aux to a mixer. When I got to the yacht today and started setting up I realized that the yacht's sound system didn't use a mixer with the input I needed. The company who owned the yacht provided me a controller though, a DDJ1000SRT, which I quickly downloaded the drivers for and started trying to get used to. That was when I hit my biggest roadblock: because all the DJs who the yacht company employed used Serato, the mapping was all over the place for me. Deck A gave me no problems, but the knobs for Deck B weren't mapped for VDJ at all. 

By the time I realized this, the party was supposed to start in 15 minutes so I started freaking out. I tried restarting my laptop, redownloading the drivers and going through everything in the VDJ settings and I still couldn't fix the mapping. People started coming on to the yacht and the employees said I needed to start playing music at the point, so I gave up and loaded up my tracks. My first few transitions were really basic but in around 10 minutes I started to get the mapping. Although there were still a few features in the software that the mapping on the controller didn't allow me to use, I started using some new techniques for mixing that I've never used before and slowly started to adapt. Despite how awful the set started out it ended as possibly my best set yet. 

I guess I'm just trying to say that I learnt an extremely important lesson today despite my good set: ALWAYS CHECK WITH THE VENUE ABOUT WHAT THE SETUP IS LIKE. Most people in this subreddit most likely already do that, but for those who don't you definitely need to start.",1713659884.0

I play Friday nights while a guy who works for the same dj company I do plays Saturdays. He is in his 50’s and has been djing for way longer than I have (I’m 23). Every time I have played at this bar I have packed the floor and had people chant for an encore so I am familiar with this crowd and know what they like and how to get them hyped. 

Anyway my coworker stopped in tonight to watch me and I let him hang out with me in the booth. I was kind of put off when he told me to move over while he mixed a few tracks without asking me permission if he could. After he went to grab a drink he started texting me that I went into a “hood” rap set far too early in the night and that I should make more of an effort to blend my tracks better despite the fact that I was key and beatmatching and mixing in each song at least 8 bars before i made a full switch. 

Later, he came back up to the booth and hijacked my controller again and kept criticizing everything I was doing. The last straw for me was when I saw him load up a track I was hoping to save for later in the night. I told him not to play it because I wanted to save it and he went ahead and mixed it anyway. I then told him that while I appreciate his feedback and recognize that he has been doing this way longer than me, he was overwhelming me and that I wanted him to leave me alone. He told me to relax and have fun and that he never intended to piss me off, but that I needed to listen to him and learn from him. He could then see me become visibly upset and started apologizing and telling me I was doing a good job afterall. After we went b2b on a couple more songs, he finally left me alone and left the bar without saying goodbye, which is unlike him as he is usually very friendly. 

I look up to this guy a lot and worry that I came off as sensitive and unteachable, but like I said before I worked my ass for this residency and feel like he had no business “schooling” me on the spot like that, especially when he will be playing that same venue the following day and has had his residency there for years while this is finally my time to shine. I still get nervous at the beginning of my sets but once I get into the flow I’m good for the night. His barging in like that threw me off and stopped me from getting out of my head.

Been toying with the idea of changing my gear up from an old pioneer SX and becoming increasing intrigued by something without jog wheels. I use pads a lot when I DJ but I also use stems a lot and Traktor doesn’t natively isolate stems.

I wish I could enjoy the whole scale to fade in/out a song and not just a part of it. 

Is this a common experience among other users? I use linear curve settings

Thanks

109,Question re: Setup,0,1c466o3,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1c466o3/question_re_setup/,16,"I DJ at a restaurant. They don’t want me to touch any of their configuration of their speakers setup. 

They have 6 JBL 12” speakers with an input and output xlr only no 1/4 mono. One of them we will call the master outputs into the next one and so on. They allow me to go into their input of the master and run it that way and that’s it. 

I have a simple setup. Laptop to mixer and 2 speaker output. So what I did was took the right speaker and powered the master. The issue is I only get the right channel sound on the restaurants speakers. 

At least if they had a 1/4 mono I could run mono from my mixer and it would sound better. My speakers sound fine, it’s their speakers that are daisy chaining that sound bad. Is there a solution for this like a splitter that I can go into that will run both my channels output into 1 xlr input and make the daisychain sound half way decent?

I guess DMC Championship is still a relevant event in the modern djing communty, but im trying to recall an specific set from the first decade (or maybe two first decades) where the DJ (and im not sure it was a solo dj or a team, actually think it was a team) they took all Vinyls off the turntables and then pitched the static sounds in order to create a melody with the crossfader. 

If im right that it was a team, they were a pretty strong one (in terms of the djing community back then) but i cant recall the name, and therefore cant find the set. Ive tried google and all the basics but since im not native english i cant find it (specially since there are Dj static and Dj noize that are the results that pop up when trying to search it).

The current state of software according to the latest Digital DJ Tips survey is

|Software|Marketshare|
|:-|:-|
|Rekordbox|31%|
|Serato|30%|
|VirtualDJ|14%|
|Traktor|10%|
|Engine DJ|7%|
|Other|5%|
|Djay Pro|3%|

On the hardware side its

|Company|Marketshare|
|:-|:-|
|Pioneer|56%|
|InMusic\*|25%|
|Traktor|8%|
|Others\*|12%|

\* Denon 12%, Numark 9%, Rane 4%  
\*\*Other 2.8%, Technics 2.7%, Hercules 2.6%, Roland 1.7%, Reloop 1.6%, Allen & Heath .6%

Outside of Engine, most InMusic hardware is designed to work with Serato, but has compatibility with other software like VDJ, DJay Pro. This merger is going to give Pioneer / AlphaTheta 61% of software market and will eventually decimate the hardware market.

InMusic doesn't seem to have a solid hardware or software strategy - they created Engine DJ to be embedded only with the desktop software only used to organize libraries and export to portable media. Maybe its because they didn't want to compete with their partner Serato - but their partner Serato will soon be their competitor.

Other brands that collab with serato will soon also see their marketshare diminish.

I believe Pioneer will take the best parts of Serato, implement into RekordBox and slowly disinvest in Serato (or vice versa for more of a money grab). I would love to be proven wrong, but I don't see why they would continue to develop these two softwares separately.

Lastly, it seems like InMusic is experimenting too much with its product lines and oversegmenting. The club level gear for Rane and Denon make sense, but then they release the Denon SC Live 4 which is more akin to the Numark line (which used to be pro before InMusic but is now really consumer only). The Rane One/Four controllers are club quality but not really club gear. Lastly, InMusic seems to be moving many of its Engine controller features to software only - which makes using laptop/software limit access to features. (Example, mic eq on SC Live 4 is accessible via touch screen but if you use Serato/VDJ, you lose access to mic eq)

Not saying other companies are better, but we need the industry to figure itself out before we end up with a bleak future.

With another 4 local DJs we have formed a DJs and Event Planner organization that cover only ""darkly oriented"" alternative music. Keep in mind that the ""darkly oriented"" music genres cover a lot of things (from goth rock to darktechno, let me put in this way), and we have different tastes in music and libraries as well.  
Today we are starting to plan the events for next year (so we are also talking of concerts and live act).  


Trying to make sense to our different tastes (and personal libraries) I try to associate every live act for next year to some of the dj.  
It was the most logic thing to me: if we call an Aggrotech band we cannot let a coldwave dj play after, same if we call a darkwave band we cannot let a darktechno dj play after, and so on. The public will be totally different and the dancefloor always empty and/or angry.

The other djs instead are arguing that: ""we can all play every genre, why are you assuming that we can't?"" 

It was a group chat but after that reply I'm honest I was a bit lost and drop the discussion.

For me divide our group in the most effective genre for every dj was the most reasonable solution, I was wrong at assuming this?

We know our style, history and library very well, so we know if one of us can cover a genre or not.

What did you think?   
I was wrong at assuming this kind of separation for future events?

I'm confused by this, and here's why. If you activate autogain, it attempts to set the gain for you. However, you can manually adjust the autogain level, and once you find the right level it is saved. I like this a lot. I manually determined the gain based on levels and perceived loudness, and that info is now saved with the track.

I get that it's pretty stupid to just blindly allow autogain to pick your levels (I can't think of a single example where I didn't adjust the gain manually), but I do not think it is stupid to have a saved gain level based on manual adjustments.

In the dead ass Traktor sub, and to my knowledge here as well, Traktor autogain is universally shit on, and nobody has even mentioned this aspect of using autogain.

Am I stupid?

2 Pioneer PLX 500 turntables w/ a Headliner R2 Mixer

I currently record the radio show strictly from the Prime 2, but I'm looking to have one combined setup where I can mix vinyl & digital tracks.

I am considering a few options and would love any insight you have!

First, I plan to get an XLR mic (Rode, Shure, etc). Second, I plan to upgrade to a Mastersounds Radius 4 MK2. I love rotary mixers and can't afford many of the bespoke brands, so the Radius 4 seems like the one for me. Nonetheless, I'm open to any rotary recs you may have!

Where I really need help is in deciding which digital media players would make the most sense in my setup. I would ideally spend less than $1.5k USD. I'm considering the following (probably used):

XDJ-1000s

XDJ-1000MK2s

XDJ-700s

CDJ-900NXS

CDJ-900

Denon SC5000 & LC6000

I'm not married to any brand or model. My top priorities are connectivity (the whole system just ""works"" together), Ease of use (some people who will be using the set-up aren't super experienced), and hopefully keeping these for a while.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated :)

After that they disappeared for 3 weeks and a week ago sent me an email offering to meet once more and discuss if and how exactly we could work together.

Playing at top venues in Berlin and have a residency, however, the amount of gigs is very low- sometimes I dont have them at all the whole month, sometimes just 2-3 max. And this fact was something that confused them during the first interview.  They told most of gigs should come from a dj, not from them and sometimes its too early for a dj to enter the agency. My point is to help me to enter international market since I only play in Berlin for now. In general their behavior looks a bit confusing for me.

Now, I'm looking to expand my horizons and venture into playing at restaurants.

I've even seen[DJs mixing in restaurants](https://youtu.be/jDvvW0pf8wA?si=D-g65lHpwkQgjid9) on the internet and I love the idea. As a restaurant owner, it's for sure a cool way to add something extra to your place.

I'm curious if anyone here has experience with restaurant gigs. Specifically, I'm wondering about the practical side of things - do most restaurants have decent speakers, or do you need to bring your own gear? Did it take a lot of ""convincing"" to play there? Also, from a broader perspective, how do you view restaurant gigs as a DJ opportunity in general? Couldn't they be a fun and relatively low-effort way to make consistent money compared to the bigger bar and club gigs?

I would mention the venue in question are just town bars/clubs, a venue for punters to have a Saturday night out, have a few drinks and have fun. I presume that as the venues get larger, its more suitable to use more professional heavy duty equipment.

At a recent open deck spot, I had been given an hour set that stretched out to three.

For me as a DJ, I am inclined to put on a good performance, however when the kit changes often from venue to venue, spending a bit of time assessing the equipment for any deviations from other layouts drew time away from track selection and keeping the crown entertained.

I have been offered a paid spot in a few weeks time, so I feel inclined to put on a good set.

Some of the steps I have in mind is first checking with the promoter/venue,

Then other helpful, preventative tasks, such as coming in early, offering any help around set up, checking my gear and sound, preparing how it will be set up if a deck change is required etc etc. Got no issues paying my dues, just seeing if I would be wasting my time asking if I get any more offers to play in the future.

You keep it on in case of emergencies? Do you occasionally scroll here or there and then get back to business?

The reason I ask is because I get very easily distracted, and I have often pondered what I would do during a set to prevent accidental muscle-memory scrolling/distractions.

I have in the past vinyl only and put on my own small acid/Chicago nights which has its own appeal but as I’ll now also be spinning indie music on some of the nights it just isn’t practical lugging loads of records about. We will still be mixing old skool house and acid for some of the nights, so a controller that is suited to both would also be great.

Just killing some time, hoping to be proven wrong about Overmono-type music, looking for recommendations on the future of dance music as dance music rather than elsewhere....

--

Watching people from the Overmono boiler room set made me think structual complexity in house music or other genres is not going to be a crowd pleaser until it is because it was defined that way by marketing machines and big money driving culture through repetition.

Difficulty in predicting the transitions, or the thematic vocal driving the vibe, or never getting to a drop, or even the awkward beat structure is as uncomfortable as Jazz progressions that never resolve to tonics. 

Just as a first listen through to Overmono's work, it seems like the exact opposite of dancefloor vibes, even if it is house music or danceable whatever-genre. But look at the dancers in the crowd reacting to transitions. 

I get listening to them in a different context, having them played to add a vibe to a room where you're not focused on dancing, having them on in the car, or putting headphones on and walking around. It's stylistically appealing, it's mood music, it's not fully in the foreground or background.

Every time you see people follow along to their anticlimaxs and then become awkward, self-conscious, bored. Then a new vocal comes on and people are comfortable again.

I'm currently using a zoom h1n but unless the input level is set really low, it has a tendency to clip badly.
It's fine for a studio environment but in a club where the levels tend to get pushed up higher it ends up sounding distorted.

Is there a better device available that has a bit more headroom so won't clip as easily?

Back in the day I used to use a mini disc and that was pretty much plug and play, with the internal limiter keeping the levels sounding good. Looking for something like that really.

I have had my DJM v10 since 2020 and I recently noticed that when using effects and turning the level/depth knob, whatever effect I am using cuts in and out.  

In observing it more and more, I noticed that the effect only cuts out when the knob itself is moved or forced in a downward direction. If I hold it an upward direction while I turn the knob,  the effects have no issue working.  I am guessing something has to be re soldered?  

I haven't found this issue described anywhere else and just thought id put this out there to help determine if this could potentially be an easy fix if i open it up myself or does it sound serious enough to send out for repaid at my certified retailer?

Wouldn't it be amazing if pioneer/alphateta/whatever released a controller that is basically just one deck off of a ddj1000/flx1000? So you can take those and add them as 3d & 4th decks to your ddj1000/flx10 and have a full ddj1000/flx10 4 physical decks controller setup with a laptop. Or add a few to a djm mixer to have the same thing with a laptop while using the djm soundcard. Something similar to a denon's LC6000. I believe the technology is obviously already here. You just need to cut one deck off of a ddj1000/flx10 and have it as a single midi controller. 

I understand that this might damage the cdjs sales, but if I am buying a set of 3000s, for sure I will be using them fully and not just as a glorified controller. They are so much more than just a MIDI keyboard and with a pricetag to fit it too. And from what I've seen in the dj space I believe many people think the same way. So this single deck midi controller would fit in a currently empty market niche (only Denon has something like this with the lc6000. The traktor x1 is different). So if they release a single deck midi controller in the style of ddj1000/flx10 I think it will be a huge hit imo. It will start making the controller market modular and will open the possibility of many new configurations between the already existing gear. 

Let me know what you think. Does it sound like a good idea to you or complete bs? If you agree share your thoughts on would pioneer even want to release such a product. ",1711920364.0

My partner is a DJ. I handle a lot of the backend stuff for him, accounting, website, promo, socials etc. I gig with him often as an assistant/under. He got a gig in Providence at a newish restaurant/lounge in a weird spot off the main strip. Owner hired him for karaoke and to play music between performances every Thursday night. Agreed to pay his fee, said he was gonna make a flyer, promote etc and said he expected it to be slow in the beginning. Partner discussed cash in hand same night for pay. Owner wants to start right away. 

First week is dead. We did our best with promo but the lounge didn’t promote and didn’t want us to make a flyer. owner asks if he can pay half the fee since it was dead… acknowledges the bad weather was a factor whatever. Partner accepts half as goodwill for a regular gig. 

We finally get a flyer and promote all week as best we can but we don’t pay for ads for businesses giving us a flat fee especially for karaoke so it’s all organic. We do invest in our promotion for our own organized gigs which have great turnout. But it’s for mixing sets and the crowd that likes my partner like to dance. Lounge once again doesn’t promote. Thursday comes, owner starts texting asking how many people are coming. My partner says he got about 30 responses to the fb event he made and he’s been promoting all week but it’s another bad weather night (highly walkable area with little parking - bad weather kills foot traffic especially since this place is off the beaten path). Owner says he personally invited 50 people. Cool. Partner asks why owner isn’t promoting on socials. Owner says they posted once on their story… and won’t share our posts because of the “ghetto” music on one of them (black eyed peas for those wondering… 🙄)

This thursday had like 15 people. Owner acts cool and tells my partner it’s the weather, yada yada no big deal. But at the end of the night says I’ll pay you at 10 am tomorrow. My partner was hesitant but agreed because the owner seems so sincere. Told him to call at 10 am and he would cashapp him. 

10 came and went the guy won’t answer the phone or texts. Every couple hours sends us a short text saying he is gonna call basically dicking us around all day. Finally around 3 sends a voice message saying he wasn’t gonna pay us our full fee again (will only pay half) because my partner didn’t bring enough people in, and he will get the payment taken care of but he wants to “see what you can bring to the table next week”. He never sent the money. Big surprise. Not sure if he seriously thinks we are going to continue a business relationship with him. 

I’m just so sick of these business owners conflating club promoters and DJs. Yes we do promotion but ur paying us to play music. They want us to have viral tik tok levels of followers and reach and make the establishment blow up overnight. For karaoke. And then he can’t even pay the agreed fee or do his own bare minimum promotion. 🤡 Now the whole gig is shitcanned 2 weeks in (for us, anyway). 

I know there’s nothing to really be done about this situation other than not work with this guy anymore but he sucks and I wanted to vent with some people who can relate to the frustration. If I had been with my partner on this night I would not have agreed to the delayed payment. If they don’t have the money that night chances are you aren’t getting paid. In my experience. We’ve run into this situation several times throughout the years and if we are together and in person we can usually get paid with a little pressure. I couldn’t fathom hiring someone for a gig (and we do put people on to work door for our self-organized events) and then not paying them for showing up and doing their job because I wasn’t happy with the turnout. We always pay our people. 

TLDR; Providence lounge owner stiffed us for a karaoke gig due to lack of attendance, despite not promoting their own event and expecting us to do all the leg work. ",1711863436.0

Follow the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies of your data, on 2 different media, with 1 stored offsite.

My backups personally look like this:

\- 2 external SSD's which are mirrors which I carry to gigs (this satisfies the 2 different media rule)

\- 1 copy on my server at home (this satisfies the 3 copies part, as well as 2 different media in a slightly different way)

\- 1 copy in the cloud (I use Backblaze which this is *not* an advertisement for, there's lots of good options, this is just what I use! This satisfies the 1 offsite copy.)

This is a touch excessive, I know, but it has saved my butt more than once.

And actually, here's an extra tidbit: if you have the ability to *version* your backups, do so. I haven't paid for the versioned edition of Backblaze, but now I'm kinda sad as I realized that my Serato library has been corrupt for some time (missing a bunch of files).

Hello!

I've been DJing for over 10 years, and I've always been interested in musical keys for my mixes. They bring coherence to all the sets I create. Up until now, I've always used the classic referencing method, but then I discovered Alphanumeric and Kamelot's wheel.

For those who aren't familiar, there are plenty of resources on YouTube on the subject.

My question is: What do you use? Classic or Alphanumeric?

Also, what are, for you, the best key combinations that might not seem logical but sound good together?

I've never learned music other than through DJing, so sorry if I offend the purists; I'm just trying to do my best.

223,best setup for recording mixes from Xone/Pioneer portably (and maybe vinyl sampling too),2,1brgm6t,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1brgm6t/best_setup_for_recording_mixes_from_xonepioneer/,9,"hi everyone, i've checked older posts but didn't find a convincing answer so i need your help to find the best setup to safely record our hybrid dj/live mixes from the widest range of mixers found in clubs.

home setup is Xone 92 + XDJ1000 + MC101 or TR8 + TB3, when playing in clubs the mixer is usually Xone 92/96 but we came across any kind of device, from Pioneer V10 to Xone 23 or rotary mixers. reading older posts, budget mobile recorders such as Tascam DR-05X seem the best choice, as they can record into SD card from the external line input and have a decent battery life.

so first basic question is whether we should connect the device to Rec or Booth output on the mixer, and if one of them could allow us to use a standard preset on the recording device without needing to check the audio file each time for clipping.

i've compared the specifications for few commonly found mixers of all price tags (Xone 23/92/96 and Pioneer 450/850/V10) and seems the nominal Rec output has a smaller range when comparing the different models. it stands around -8dBu for all of them except for 23 and 450 (the first one having 0dBu and the second one not having a Rec output at all). Booth output ranges instead from -2dBu on Xone 23/92 up to +6dBu on expensive Pioneer models. so my basic knowledge of the subject tells me the Rec output is the best choice here. if there's something i'm missing please tell me (probably something about nominal/max output or dBu/dBV).

this said, Tascam DR-05X has a maximum input level of -4dBV so i should be able to set its Line input to roughly -6/-15dBV and stay safe while recording mixes on different models, without the need to check specifications for Rec output on each mixer that we come across. in any case, a quick post production will be necessary, at least to give some gain as the audio files will come out at different volumes depending on the mixer we used, but that's not a problem. i just want to make sure that there's no chance of clipping, Logic will do the rest.

so why should i need an attenuator if my conclusions are somehow correct? i'm kind of missing the point of it, and what's the difference with a good quality shielded RCA cable combined with the correct input setup on the Tascam.

last short questions, is there any reason to invest some additional money into mid range models, such as DR-40X or Zoom H4n, or maybe wait to find a second hand deal? i don't care too much about field recording or 4 tracks splitting so is there any better feature for the external line input (less distortions or whatever)?

last one for real, any chance i can connect the Tascam directly to a Mixars STA turntable to sample some vinyl? no Rec, just Line out so i guess the output will be way stronger (could be around +50 dBV if my doubtful conversion isn't too bad). there's no GND on this turntable so i don't need a wire, but i can imagine that's way too much for the Tascam so i will have to go through a mixer.

The mixer runs out to a pair of Klipsch The Fives and a relatively cheap sub that sounds great in my smaller room. 

All in all it’s a fantastic setup and I’m very happy with how it sounds.

It doubles as a mixing setup as well as a hi-fi listening set up. Lately I’ve been really enjoying jazz and doing a lot of listening and collecting vinyl, buying particular pressings and really zoning in on the specific listening experience of each pressing. 

With this being said I’m aware that the weakest link sound wise in my set up is the DJM mixer and I found a XONE 32 mixer for cheap on marketplace that I’m going to go check out this evening. 

I know that the A&H mixers are known for great sound and that they are fully analog and I’m looking forward to making the switch. I’m wondering though if I could tap this community for some anectdotes before I pull the trigger. How much better will the new analog Xone mixer actually sound based on the set up I’ve got?

I found a very interesting specimen. I am not a professional career DJ but I do have some experience, played along some relatively big names. So I think I am knowledgeable enough to have a little discussion. Now I met this guy, probably a troll, that pretends to be a Radio DJ in the Uk. He’s apparently playing 8 decks at once, loves to sync, is shitposting while on air for the whole uk, he loves to mix basslines and if things get tricky -> b2b! Besides that all his sets are behind paywalls, something I also never heard of. 

The discussion began around why the sync button can be dangerous, for example when rekordbox did not properly analyse the track, placing the grid incorrectly. Happened to me more than once when I started playing on proper equipment and tried to save a messed up transitions with the sync button, which made it even worse. I also think playing manually keeps the spirit of djing and keeps you aware and on your toes, helps you not overdoing your mix. 

I will post some citations and invite you all to make fun of it and feel free to elaborate why the things said are complete bullshit 

Enjoy: 

„ Had 8 decks on the flow yesterday, all in turn. Synced now and then to bring them in, when things turned tricky. B2B.“

„ you have no idea. Being able to sync now makes you able to bring other parts of the music in as opposed to keeping your fingers on the vinyl to keep synced. It's opened things up but of course you obviously wouldn't know ;)“ 

This one is interesting he is able to use the sync button on vinyls

„If you can't mix a bass line, that shows how shit you are. That's EXACTLY what you should be doing. Fuck me

I make bass lines sound good together. That's the difference between me and you ;)“ 

Obviously most electronic music has to heavy bass to properly mix it, and it’s usually clear that the transition point sits where the new bass line is introduced. I think that applies to techno, house, dnb, hardcore and hip hop. But the hero here is better than all of us.

„ 6 decks, two rooms.; the main and the chill out. (two rooms and yet you probably think you're good with two decks whilst not getting paid). All broadcast at the same time. Bitch thinks she knows shit XD on pathetic equipment. Better yourself.“

I know it’s a little dated when you think of the number of controllers that have been released since 2016, but my focus has been making beats for awhile now and the dj808 seems to be the best tool for the producer-DJ. I imagine I can sketch out beats from loops on serato and connect to my drum machine or use the 808 section to layer drums. There’s no other DJ hardware with a midi out. I’ve also seen my two favorite producers use it up to even recently (Pete Rock and Alchemist), which shouldn’t matter but heck, I want to emulate my idols. 

My main concerns for the DJ 808 are that 1) it’s discontinued by Roland so finding replacement parts might be a hassle, 2) it’s not built like a brick (also considering a Rane One, which is a tank), 3) the producer set up I imagine will end up being too complicated to sketch out beats and I’m left with useless features (I like gorilla beat making on my sp-404)

The reason why the Rane One is appealing to me is because I imagine being more comfortable with it DJing at say a backyard function. It’s minimal, would be more natural for me to scratch with (used to use turntables for DJing way back when), and has a solid build for mobile use. For beat-making, it has an AUX in which is minimally all I need to sketch a beat out. 

TLDR: get the DJ 808 for its producing features even though it’s discontinued, or get something new and not worry about the producing aspect.

Where djs have their entire set figured out before they even arrive at the club. Without going into my opinion on that too deeply, I will provide some ways I have used over the years to always be able to improvise my sets. A very rewarding feeling to be able to adjust what I am doing to what I see on the floor and have it work. Whereas if I had it all planned out and saw my idea fall flat, what then?

1. Organize your music library based on the vibes you play. Inside my House folder I have playlists. !House\_All is where everything goes no matter what. ""-bpm"" playlist is for tracks that are slower than 120bpm. ""+bpm"" is for tracks above 130bpm. Another separate playlist for every subgenre of house I mess with. Whenever a new track is added to my collection I simply drag a copy of the track to every applicable playlist. I also have playlists dedicated to energy levels. A playlist called ""early glow"" for music that would get people dancing if they are not, but not in a pushy way. Traktor users who know about preparation playlists can gets tons of mileage organizing their music using them almost like a cheat code. 
2. For a gig, make a playlist adding way more music than you expect to have time to play. Practice sets with the playlist and don't adhere to an order. Hopefully the playlist has changes in energy levels from one song to another. So now it's on you to match those with what you see on the dance floor in realtime.

Just keeping a couple habits like this has allowed me to improvise every set I have played.

Long story short I've returned to the scene and have been working hard the last year to get caught up with the new techniques and equipment and one thing seems to be tripping me up a little more than I would expect... collection.

Back in the day it was easy to keep things organized because you had a couple record crates and could keep things visually how you needed them.  That and long blends and longer songs were more common so you played less songs so you didn't need a huge collection.

So I've got things pretty trim, as I do multiple kinds of gigs so it's easy to keep a playlist of ""corporate gigs"" and ""X genre"" type of things... but I also have been getting attention and gigs for my actual harder funky DJ stuff that I did back in the day.  I used to show up to multiple Open Decks in a week with a USB of 100 songs I knew I wanted to highlight and just freestyled... but now that I'm getting full sets booked, I worry that there will be too much overlapping and that anyone who sees me will hear 25% of my ""keepers"" on any given gig if I just stick to 100-ish tracks.  Granted that 100 will be refined as I hear new stuff I want to play, but still there will obviously be my favorites on that stick.

So my question for established DJs who book regular club gigs and EDM gigs (not laptop driven multi-hour wedding or corporate gigs)...  Even if your collection is 1000+ songs... how many do you take to a typical gig and do you just expect that people will hear a few of the same tracks if they come out and support you often?  ESPECIALLY if you're known for playing a specific type of EDM?",1711400714.0

Got to the bar, got all my gear setup, but since I got there early, I failed to power everything on until it was time for me to play. That was a mistake. I had this issue once before, and since I live less than a mile from the venue, I took the controller, cables and computer home for testing and it powered up just fine. At the time, I chalked it up to operator error (I figured I didn't seat the power or USB cable properly). But yesterday, I did the same thing and it would not power on despite trying different cables.

I think it's a hardware issue and I'm pissed at the design of the power adapter plug into the unit. I learned it's not good for consistent gigging aka constant plugging/unpluging of the power adapter. I've owned it since April of 2020 and despite the one hiccup last year. Since June of last year, I've used it in the wild - meaning I've had to plug/unplug it at least once a month to bring it to the bar.

Now, I'm looking at a XDJ-XZ or XDJ-RX3. I'd love to get a couple XDJ-1000mk2's and a DJM-750mk2, but since I'm trying to save for a home in the future, I can't really justify the cost of the modular setup. I do plan to eventually send the DDJ-1000 for repair. I hope it can be repaired because I'd like to use it as a backup. Lesson learned: HAVE A BACKUP IF YOU'RE GIGGING!

I'd LOVE to have a modular setup, but currently, I'm only playing the bar, streaming on Twitch, recording mixes a few times a year, and just mixing for fun whenever… And if I start getting back to playing venues/events/clubs, I would probably be booked via a promoter, so they should have the pro gear (DJM-900nxs2/CDJ-3000s/etc.), so I just show up with my headphones and USB drives. I like having a 4-channel setup of the XZ but the RX3 seems more portable and has a much better screen - it's also $400 cheaper than the XZ. If I were to get the XZ, I would probably never get a modular system until the XZ dies lol.

Anyway, this long-ass post was to vent my frustration and any advice/suggestions would be great.",1711386326.0

And I have been doing it for some quite time (few years). I'm not preforming a lot, but every 2-3 months I have something.

1. My library is on external hard drive and I'm using MacOS. I had few times that I needed to change my computer to a new one. What I usually do is to just drag and drop the files into iTunes and then recreate the smart-playlists that I had, as well as playlists that I created (usually sets that I preformed / recorded). The thing is that the to recreate the smart-playlists is an annoying process which I need to remember the rules. What is the best way to overcome this? is there a way the library structure and playlist could be kept, so when I switch computer one day I can be sure that it will be an instant thing?

Looking for some advice on the best way to go about recording some of my records with my current setup for use at gigs. I do buy digital copies of everything i can get hold of online, or buy the tracks on CD & rip if there is a cd release available. Some of my older music, white labels etc ive not been able to find so would like to rip them from wax. Setup is as follows -

Pioneer XDJ-XZ
2 x Reloop RP7000 Mk2
Reloop Concorde carts & stylii (i believe they are just rebadged Ortofon Pro S Mk1)
Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 3rd gen interface
Macbook Pro Mid 2012 & MSI Windows gaming laptop with Serato Dj Pro, Ableton, Garageband & Audacity
2 x 'classic' Technics-style headshells with Stanton 500 carts (i dont think the stylii are genuine Stanton, most probably copies)

Ive tried recording direct from vinyl to USB stick on the XZ & it sounds ok, not sure how well the recordings will hold up next to 'new' digital wav's & mp3's on a big system. I'm using the turntables thru the 'Line' inputs on the XZ as they have line-level output as well as phono (presuming line level is the way to go as Pioneer's phono pre-amps seem to be regarded as poor).

Have also tried recording through the Scarlett to computer & to me the recordings sounded a lot more 'flat' & quieter than direct to USB.

There's so much info online about this its pretty overwhelming, most of it from 'audiophile' types rather than gigging dj's. Should i buy a vinyl cleaning machine? What cart & stylus to use? Do i need an expensive phono pre-amp? Cork or rubber turntable mats? So much info i just dunno where to start 😵‍💫

Would be nice to get some ideas from working dj's who have had decent results playing vinyl rips alongside digital downloads on club systems.

I play House/Garage/UKG so decent bass & crisp vocals from the recordings are a must. Thanks for reading 👍🏻

The place is an absolute dream of a venue. Kind of a hidden entrance on the side of a hill, with not a trace of sound coming out of it. Then you enter through the reception, down a flight of stairs and into this incredibly curated, beautifully crafted dream of a club environment. 

Sprung wooden dance floors, no tables for bottle service, mind blowing, crystal clear 4 point speaker system, discrete DJ booth tucked away in the wall above the dance floor, beautiful haze and elegant, minimal lighting. Just the crème of the crop for the kind of eyes closed, pure sound dancing experience a lot of us crave and grew up on. 

The problem was the crowd. The vibes were shit, at least for the couple of hours we were there. Paul Woolford is an absolute god and the music was incredibly on point, the venue was divine, but most of the crowd had this kind of Uber hipster, too cool for school, fashionista attitude that just sucked. No passion, no energy, no commitment, as the meme goes. 

I could have closed my eyes and just jammed in this womb of pure sound and still had a great time, but my friends were really not feeling it so we ended up leaving around 2 and going somewhere else (which was a disappoint to me but we were a big group so wanted everyone to feel comfortable). 

I’m by far the most purist and experienced raver in the group, and this place is designed especially for people like me. So it could just be my friend’s attitudes sucked, but the truth is the vibe of the rest of the crowd was pretty lame too. 

Has anyone else visited and had a different experience? Maybe it was just an off night or my friend’s shitty attitude couldn’t appreciate it or coloured my experience? Does the crowd ever really pop off and go wild, doing justice to the love and care of Harvey and the designers of this incredible gem?

Just curious if anyone else has had an experience of this, because crowd last night aside, it’s pretty much the closest thing to perfect I’ve ever seen. 

Hopefully I can go again tonight to see Chaos in the CBD and maybe the vibes and crowd will be different. It’s definitely an aficionado’s paradise, just seemed to be too few aficionados and too may posers / cool kids there when I visited last night. 

Hope I’m wrong because the world needs more of Klymax style purist places, not less! ",1711192020.0

Bonus points for couches. All I ask from the audience is a few head bobs here and there as I look out over the room. Maybe a finger gun or two as people walk by to use the restroom. This would be heaven.

I'm happy to seek that out and/or put on my own night someplace, if I could find the right place. Just curious if anyone else has some *kind* of event or venue that comes to mind. Meanwhile, I'll make a couple demo mixes and start a list of possible venues in my town...

I still feel confident in my skills, but then sometimes I hear other DJs and I go ""damn I need to get like that guy! That guy is talented!""

So my question is this, what can I do differently in practice to take me to the next level? ",1711035064.0

I haven't played any gig in 3 months and it seems like things won't get any better. The reason being - I don't play the music that everyone else is playing

Let me paint the picture for you....So, I'm a DJ and producer from India and have been active in my local scene for 2 years now. I like making & playing house music and really melodic stuff. Recently, I've been offered a full time residence at a bar. The pay is good and I was really considering to take it. But the owner wants me to quit playing what I like and play all the generic bollywood music. 

I really don't like playing those songs and recently it's starting to feel like I'm getting outcasted because of that reason. The scene in my city is really closed off for any newcomer and the only way to get any gigs is by compromising what you love playing and do what the promoter wants you to do. 

I'm really struggling financially and I've now faced with this situation of either giving up on my music or be bullied by the promoters to get whatever gigs they offer me.

I am aware of the key differences between nexus 1 and nexus 2 - less hot cues, no beat jump (which is the worst one, I use this a lot if I accidentally get out of phrase), worse sound quality (but does that matter when its for home use only?), no technical support/repair anymore. Also it's without a flight case, but again, doesn't matter since it will be for home use only. But the lowest I've seen complete nexus 2 setup go for is 4400$.

In the future I am very interested in start to mix with even more decks, CDJ's or turntables.

291,What are the realities of live streaming?,0,1bjwtmo,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1bjwtmo/what_are_the_realities_of_live_streaming/,46,"Hello.

  
To clarify i'm talking about live streaming/broadcasting DJ sets (as opposed to sourcing music from streaming services)

First post. I've been away from Djing for 15 years or more. Started on vinyl around 1990, ended up with a macbook + serato + turntables around 2005? Anyway, I'm getting back into it (with an ipad initially) and I'm interested in live streaming which I didnt even take much notioce of during the pandemic, so to say I'm novice is putting it mildly

Having done some very quick research, I'm wondering about legalities. I understand you can get away with it? But I'd rather do it properly (as a copyright holder I'm not against hobby DJ's being able to live stream and promote music, but on a more professional level rights holders should get paid - but lets not get sidetracked with that debate).

I'm also wondering about live streaming to bars. Most bars should have a license, but also i imagine most major social live streams will shut you down, so thats not gonna work, right? Or wrong? Or nobody cares?

So, legally what are the realities?

Is there a way i can play anything I want it without licensing it individually, directly (not gonna happen obvs)? Any services that provide for this (paying is fine within reason)?

Then again, let's say you go live on the main social platforms, what is the reality of that, not just legally, but technically, mentally etc?

Quick backstory…
I work for an AV integrator we do mostly conference rooms and public access broadcast systems. 

We have a client that we work with a few times a year that builds out  trade show trucks for festivals. 
Think a box truck that is custom branded with added features of the product they are selling and to hand out merchandise at these festivals and trade shows.

We outfit a few of these with speakers and amps connected to a simple multi-channel mixer that is for a local music source and mics. With connections for outside vendors or whatever they want to bring to these festivals. They typically hire local talent to do these events. 

So here is my question…
We have been asked to spec an all in one DJ system for the next truck they are looking at the Pioneer XDJ-XZ or Rane Four. Both are 4 channel units similar feature and support Serrato. However our stance has always been let the talent bring in there gear and connect to the system. We provide xlr, rca and I believe even a usb link. 

Are we totally off base with that line of thinking? If so what would be a system to provide a local DJ for a gig that is typically a day maybe 3?

Sorry if there are already similar posts like this, but I kind of wanted to share a bit more about my personal story. 

I ask this question because that's literally me as a DJ and I'll explain why. First of all, I love DJing and it is one of my happy places whenever I get behind the decks playing to a crowd. However, I'm very shy, introverted, awkward, self-conscious, have social anxiety, probably on the autism spectrum....you name it. I've never been a dancer or ever felt comfortable trying to dance either. 

I've been trying to improve recently, but while DJing I'd mostly be head down with a serious face. One reason for this is because I get laser focused on mixing so it looks like I'm taking an exam or something. At most, I might bob my head a few times here and there and smile when friends or crowd members are into my set and get my attention.

You might ask why do I even DJ? Again, it's one of my happy places and I get lost in the music/mixing even if it appears differently. I feel like DJing is also a way to help me express myself or release some of my emotions through the music I play. Physically, some head bobbing and smiling is probably the best I will ever be able to do. I can't force myself to dance because it comes unnatural. I've accepted it's just who I am and I can't bring myself to fake anything. Overall, I'm ok with all this about myself as a DJ but what are your thoughts? 

What do you think about DJs that don't dance or show much emotion? Are we at a disadvantage? Also, if anyone else is going through something similar...how are you dealing with it? Is it just what it is or are you trying to do something about it.

I’m here to mainly ask about equipment. My friend has XDJ XZ for decks which should be fine as i’m not interested in renting CDJS for this. I have about 5 djs lined up for the night so far and was wondering if a few more would be good or should I have longer sets instead? 

I’m also interested on some advice of sound system and lighting requirements. I’ve lined up 2x QSC KW152 speakers and 4x EV ETX18SP subwoofers which I think should do the trick. 

In terms of lighting, i’m thinking of getting some red / purple wash lighting and an AVE ECLIPSE CLUB 1000MK2 for lasers. The lasers will be slightly angled to avoid them pointing to the sky and endangering air traffic. I’d love some recommendations on specific wash lights that could be suitable for hire for the event. 

The main thing I need advice on is a generator. I’ve constantly been told an inverter is much better in this situation so that’s probably what i’m going to go for. I was just wondering with the above information how much power would the generator need? I’ve been recommended 6000-8000W, would this be ok?

I have a 6x3 Metre gazebo organised to cover the dj and equipment and am going to put 5x 2x2 Metre temporary steel fencing in front of the dj and speakers to protect the equipment from drink spills / other issues. 

I’ve organised a team of around 10+ so far for setup, security, crowd control and medial assistance. 

I’m planning to have about 300+ water bottles available for those in need as this won’t cost too much and i’m sure would be helpful. We have prepared a bunch of garbage bags for the cleanup afterwards and i’m planning to place some temporary bins around the area to try and reduce the inevitable rubbish issue in the first place. 

30 days before the event I’ll create a private instagram account and gatekeep the location until on the day to avoid police presence and unwanted patrons. The location is quite far from houses and I am doing everything in my power to prevent this from being shut down by police and to be a safe and fun night for all. 

That’s about it for now, id really appreciate some recommendations and advice from people with or without experience in this area. 

Apologies for formatting typed on phone, thanks !!

Edit 1 - 
This isn’t an official event, it’s meant for fun and it doesn’t need the most overly loud sound system or excessive catering for guests, they know what they are getting themselves into by attending.

Edit 2 - 
There won’t likely be 500 people there, this is a pure maximum amount, the actual amount will likely be between 100-300.",1710780328.0

I suspect because of this - If you can produce an hour plus that demonstrates you can mix and not mess things up, you're proving you are competent. So getting into things you see 80 minute mixes and assume ""I guess I need to be making 80 minute mixes""  


Aint nobody got time for that. Shorter = More engagement. Plus on competency, you can fake that through editing so like who gives a crap about any 80 minute set really, the other DJs who would know something is impressive also know it could have been accomplished through editing. The general public should be your target audience, not other DJs who only have time to listen to the insane amounts of music they're organizing themselves and probably not other people's mixes. 

Give the general public 30 minute mixes and 90 second video clips, they'll engage with that. I would argue that in a 30 minute mix I display my competency more than any 80 minute set I recorded in the past because I am making that 30 minutes as much of a bonfire as I can, whereas the 80 minutes I would have been maybe hesitant to be as aggressive",1710587544.0

I’ve recently grabbed a load of tracks from zipdj. Some of them are clearly, without any doubt really low quality in terms of sound output, like terrible in comparison to other tracks. (I’ll dig through and compare them properly at some point) 

I was messing about at home the other day, just mixing anything and everything as I do and not putting any thought or effort into things, just literally getting to know my music.

So I’m not paying too much attention and I mix in a track to find its stupidly quiet and muffled, it honestly sounds like a terrible rip.

Is it safe to assume zipdj and maybe other pools don’t give a shit and just want volumes of audio?

On a side note, any record pools offering lossless quality?

Thanks 


Edit*

Sorry guys, I’m now guilty of not providing enough info.

I found a track that’s a good example of my issue, it’s not the same one, but boy does it sound shit!

Just to be clear, this was downloaded directly from ZipDJ, yet a it’s a remix of an older song but I fail to see how that’s relevant in terms of audio quality?

If anyone has zipdj, please feel free to search the following track
Amigos (EP) Let’s Kick It (Original Mix) - Fer BR, Paco Osuna, Inglesias, Manu Gonzalez- [54765607]

Spek won’t install on either my Mac or MacBook.

Fakin the funk lists this particular file as 128kbps - the frequency spectrum showing a fairly consistent audio file but at 16,540.

 Not that it matters, but to offer some insight, I’m a techno dj, but grabbing a load of house tech and other stuff for a yacht party which is why I’m grabbing loads of tech house and other genres I wouldn’t normally, I also purchase everything I play at festivals in AIFF format normally but on occasion I’ll use a 320kbps mp3, this audio file I absolutely wouldn’t / couldn’t though.

I went to use my RX3 in performance mode today and noticed the effects trigger switched from channels A/B on the knob to 1/2.

Also noticed my gains not going as high as they usually would. Normally I would have them set around 10:00 and the gain would reach the first yellow light. Now I have to crank them to 12:00 for to reach the same level.

Another issue I noticed is my sampler sounds aren't working any more. I had them mapped and they were working fine. I see them triggering in RB but there's no sound coming out. I checked the gain in RB and it's at 12:00. 

AND the recording button is greyed out and not letting me record.

I went ahead and updated to the latest version of Rekordbox 6.8.3 (from 6.8.1) and I'm having the same issue. I was just using the same setup last week with no issues and this happened today.

Anyone ever experience anything like this? Please let me know if you know of a solution.


Thanks y'all.


EDIT: I also noticed that both waveforms aren't showing up on the RX3 screen when 2 tracks are loaded. It'll load one, then when I load another it won't show up. After loading another track, the previous one that didn't show appears and the new track's waveform won't appear.

SOLUTION: I guess I messed with the settings and set RB to external mixer mode this week. I switched it to internal and it fixed itself.

360,Thoughts on Aslice and Support The Sound?,4,1bexamq,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1bexamq/thoughts_on_aslice_and_support_the_sound/,15,"I can't stop thinking about [this article I read on RA](https://ra.co/news/80412), and just want to hear other peoples' takes. It's about how a number of clubs and festivals (including Basement and Wire Festival) are launching an initiative called Support The Sound which aims to ""lessen the wage gap between DJs and producers through tracklist reporting"" with Aslice. DJs playing at clubs/events that are part of this initiative will be asked to share a percentage of their revenue with producers/artists whose tracks they played during their set, which Aslice suggests as 5% or more of the DJ's gig fee.

5% is not a ton, especially from a $100-$400+ gig, and I'm not exactly sure how they're dividing it up from there. Though it seems that there is already a system in place to get these producers royalties from performances of their tracks, and that would be through the PROs (ASCAP, BMI, PRS, etc.).

Every club pays an amount per year to the PROs for a blanket license. My understanding is that writers (the artist/""producer"" in this case) get paid out from this pot of money. I got this from the Donald Passman book ""All You Need To Know About The Music Business"":

>The \[PROs\] pay based on domestic concert performances, but it's only for the top three hundred grossing tours as reported in a magazine called *Pollstar*. The PROs distribute money based on **set lists**...which they get from either the venues or the artist's management...If you're performing in coffee houses and small venues, these aren't tracked separately, but both BMI and ASCAP have programs for you to submit your materials and get paid something.

Now it's my understanding that writers who do not meet the ""top three hundred"" criteria get paid from this blanket license pool of money, though I could very well be wrong. It would make sense that if there is already a way to submit your setlists to the PROs so they can pay out these producers, then shouldn't the focus shift to there? This would require more emerging producers to make sure they're affiliated with a PRO, but why wouldn't someone want to do that. Aslice currently charges $10 per playlist (setlist) submission, but they do pay out 85% to producers. I should note that Aslice states on their website that they're not there to replace the PROs, but to act as an additional revenue source.

It feels like through this model, producers who have already registered their songs with a PRO could be getting paid twice for the same performance, though once at the expense of the DJ. Let me just say I believe artists/writers/producers should be getting paid for performances of their works. We should be buying tracks, paying for tickets to shows, etc. This initiative almost comes across as venues passing the buck off to performers, while co-opting social justice/economic justice language to juice their audiences, especially given this quote from the RA article ""the role of music producers has been marginalised and undervalued.""

I wouldn't be surprised if a major factor in some clubs embracing this model would be because they've made a deal with Aslice, the same way a venue will partner with one primary ticketing platform for a sum of money (I've seen instances where that number is in the tens-of-thousands).

Another major question would be whether the playlist submission fee is covered by the venue (which it either won't be, or it will be deducted from the DJ's pay), and if DJ's will be getting paid more as well.

Again, it's only 5% of the DJ's earnings. Playlist submission is only $10. All-in-all, producers should be compensated, I'm not saying they shouldn't, and more music makers should educate themselves on the business. DJs should be paid fairly, and the entire responsibility of this issue is not the DJ's alone. It's entirely possible that this creates a situation that frames this as a problem handed to the DJ's to remedy, rather than part of a larger issue.

So in total, pulling from outlet 2, I have one DJM, one CDJ, the standing desk, the ethernet splitter, and a lamp.

Felt lazy doing stuff. Life and other personal stuff affected my motivation. I’ve continued to DJ and make music but I am never consistent and persistent in my supposed “hobbies”. People say I’m good but I just don’t feel like putting the work. I hesitate to enjoy it. This is something I really don’t want to lose interest in my life.

While I'm getting some of these kinds of gigs, in the process of pitching myself, I'm getting solicited by venues that are looking for more open format/top 40 music. These gigs pay well but I don't think they really fit my ""brand."" It's like they're only half reading my pitch materials- they see my follower count and see the word ""DJ"" and want to book me, but essentially just want popular music/their requests.

When i was younger (18-24) I had dreams of becoming the next Ben UFO lol. I had a big group of friends with whom i went raving a lot, we did a lot of drugs and it was fun while it lasted. 

This environment, my passion for electronic music and my dead end job were the 3 core reasons i started DJ’ing. I had a lot of friends that shared my passion. My friends always enjoyed my selections and becoming a DJ felt like a career path that was meant for me. 

Then the pandemic happened. Not going in to too much detail here , but eventually those raver friend circles died out. I became depressed and i started working on myself.

I stopped working dead end jobs and decided to go to college and get a degree in CS. Fast forward to today and i have my degree and i have a job where i feel good and earning good money. I am very thankful for that.

Part of me misses playing tracks, but i also don’t have that hunger anymore. Anytime i get the opportunity to play i reject the opportunity or go in on it but don’t really want it anymore. I feel like there are a lot more passionate DJ’s out there and it is just too difficult to break through without putting in the work (obviously). It feels like i need to make a choice. Keep working my stable job, or quit and go hard DJ’ing. But i’m just doing really good at my job, and it kinda sucks because that is also the reason why i’m losing my hunger to become successful as a DJ. It feels like i let down the younger me who wanted that so bad. Maybe i just miss the idea of becoming a successful DJ

Professional DJing is not a career for the mentally weak. Every touring artist, across all genres of music and art forms, will at some point struggle with their mental health. It's the nature of the job. The combination of easy access to substances, long and late hours, irregular sleep schedules, pressure to sell tickets, social media presence/comparisons, and the need to constantly produce great art for fans, all while paying the bills, will create a ticking time bomb that will explode if not managed meticulously. I battle with this balancing act regularly, so I wanted to provide my top tips for all of you out there:

1. Self-care Is Non-Negotiable: You will burn out if you can't care for yourself. Whether meditation, exercise, healthy eating, or simply taking time for yourself, ensure you're nurturing your physical and emotional well-being amidst the hectic touring schedule.

2. Establish Boundaries: The word ""No"" is your friend and essential in carving out moments for rest. This could mean turning down a gig or the third afterparty of the weekend.

3. Stay Connected: Touring is isolating, so stay connected with loved ones and fellow DJs. Maintain relationships the best you can. Surrounding yourself with a supportive network can provide much-needed comfort and encouragement.

4. Practice Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness practices into your daily routine. Whether meditation, breathing exercises, or appreciating your surroundings, mindfulness can help reduce stress amidst the chaos of touring.

5. Seek Professional Support: Don't hesitate to seek professional support if you struggle. Touring can take a toll on mental well-being, and having a therapist or counselor to talk to goes a long way. Many therapists offer virtual sessions, making it easier to access support while on the road.

6. Stay Balanced: Take breaks from the nightlife scene when possible, engage in activities that bring you joy outside of DJing, and remember to prioritize your overall well-being above all else. Sometimes partying all night is exactly what you need to blow off steam. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY!

It was recommended from time to time, alongside alternatives like the Boss GT-1000 and the Line 6 Helix, but I did not find explicit information to which capacity it could work with the mixer. I had hopes that I could use it in dual stereo mode as both a send-return device (like the previous pedals) and a master insert (like the RMX-1000) and not only is that indeed possible, it goes even further than that.

How I set it up:

* connect H90 1/2 in to Xone 96 SND A, H90 1/2 out to Xone 96 RTN A - ensure output is set to Line level, not Hi-Z one Xone 96 and to Line level on H90 as well
* connect H90 3/4 in to Xone 96 MASTER INSERT SND, H90 3/4 out to Xone 96 MASTER INSERT RTN
* [enable dual routing in H90](https://cdn.eventideaudio.com/manuals/h90/1.7.1/content/edit-modes/routing.html#dual-routing) and choose an appropriate routing path for the effects setup
   * Pre/Post allows for using effect A for the SND/RTN chain, effect B in the master insert
   * Presets A & B in Series/Parallel on Path 1 allows for using both effects (independently) on SND/RTN
   * Presets A & B in Series/Parallel on Path 2 allows for using both effects (independently) on master insert

This works absolutely flawlessly and the resulting sound is incredible, leagues above what I was used to with the previous pedals and absolutely no degradation in the beautifully warm Xone 96 sound quality.

What I was not aware about before is that routing can be adjusted on-the-fly. Thus, two effects can be used on SND/RTN for one track, one for SND/RTN and one for the master insert during a transition and both on master insert when crafting complex compositions of multiple tracks.

Only downside I currently see for DJ use is that there only is one global tempo setting (like on the RMX-1000) and it only supports full bpm steps, no fractional steps. As far as I'm aware, the built-in MIDI clock of the H90 cannot be fed with the Xone 96's MIDI outputs, but setting it manually is surprisingly easy using the rotary knobs compared to the tap-based bpm control I was used to on the pedals, though that is available as an option as well.

It could also be used to feed both A and B SND/RTN chains, but that would lead to the loss of the master insert functionality. As effects can be customized on-the-fly on the H90 anyway, I did not see any benefit in this. The H90 Control app is surprisingly easy to use, but the pedal has so insanely many customization options that there's probably no ever being 'done' setting it up.",1709926801.0

Has anyone heard of this term for DJ’n?
It’s got something to do with BPM sign language? Like the Nashville number system for DJ’s? I saw a couple of dudes DJn together at a rave in Vegas in 2019 and they were using some kind of sign language for changes. I’m a DJ and I’ve been DJn for about 5 years but I’ve never seen anything like it before. And I asked a couple of people who didn’t know either but this one older cat said he thought it was called “Plattah!” I asked him “Platter?” And he said no, that it had an “H” at the end. I spent a couple of years checking the internet and asking around, especially DJ’s, but nothing came up. I began to think that it was just some bs that dude was telling me. But then I went to Mardi Gras in 2022 and one night I ended up watching these 2 DJ’s who were playing together and they seemed to be using the same technique. I think it was a guy and girl but they were dressed up in costumes (if you’ve ever been to Mardi Gras, you know what I’m talking about!) I got a chance to talk to them after their set and they affirmed that they were using “Plattah” and I was right about it being like the Nashville Number System for DJ’s! They showed me how it worked but I was so fucked up, I can’t even remember their DJ names… But I remember it was mostly fingers on one hand kinda like a baseball catcher calling a play or something and all I really remember is that it somehow covered BPM’s, the Key of the track, changes or transitions, AND genres somehow because these cats were playing all kinds of shit! 
Well, now me and a friend are DJn together and he’s been a hip hop DJ for years now and I’ve been primarily EDM since I started but recently we’ve both been branching out and even delving into old funk and disco. We like mashups and we like each other’s style and stuff and hanging out going to shows and recently decided to join forces and DJ together but we both freestyle our sets so naturally we want to freestyle DJn together! We tried Abelton Link but we both agreed it just didn’t sound right or vibe well and while practicing we can just kinda tell each other BPM’s or changes but in a louder environment, that shit don’t fly! 
So my question is, does anyone know about the PLATTAH method and can tell me how to do it or point me in the direction of where to get some kind of instructions for it? Like I said it’s definitely a thing but obviously it’s not widespread knowledge.",1709903965.0

I have 3 big tabs with techno, house, disco, and hits, but there are too many subgenres. Some playlists have 10 songs and others have 200 which makes it very difficult to have a good overview. One big problem is that whenever I want to add a new playlist, I then have to go through all my songs to see if they fit the playlist which takes too much time with 3100 songs. I also have playlists for specific sets I play which is usually what I resort back to when I am looking for songs to play at another set but this results in me playing a lot of the same songs and missing out on bangers that I have forgotten about.

Did anyone else have and solve this problem for themselves? There is probably not one universal best library layout as everyone plays differently but some tips would be very useful! I do not want to spend 20 hours sorting everything again, only to realise halfway that I regret the chosen layout.

Im in Canada and promoter doesn't know wtf does that mean, we're trying to reach the person throwing the party but i wanna start digging for tracks right away.

So far I was thinking : Garage, dnb, breakbeats, euro 4/4 (130-145bpm). Maybe a some techno in there and a LOT of drill acapellas and or recognizable vocals ala flowdan.

Any ideas to interpret ""Uk vibes""?


:UPDATE: Alright, well, thanks for an absolutely MASSIVE amount of very good recommendations!

 but unfortunately, it seems like the host saw Fred again and Chase & status's Boiler room, and that's his UK vibe. So, nothing too ""deep"", and promoters want to keep it appealing to a larger crowd

So what i'll be going for is ""sub genre mainstream"" as i 
like to call it. So Basically, play very popular tracks they probably heard from sub genres they mostly barely know. To make them feel like they're experiencing ""underground"" music even tho it's garage or dnb anthems. Also throw in some night bass since they'll most likely know this as well.

 I'll be digging in your recommendations, so far found some good stuff. And some really neat stuff for my fun lil' personal collection.

But now since I became a full time DJ it is harder to talk and communicate to people. They don't know what I mean or go through.


- When you are off, everybody else is working
- When you are working, everybody else is sleeping
- People have a hard time understanding how difficult it is to be a freelancer and not always having certainty of income like you have with a 9 to 5 job.
- Everybody thinks you do nothing but partying which is of course not true. I was almost denied renting a room because of this.

Not so great for those who use Tidal with software such as Serato, VirtualDJ, or Algoriddum djay Pro is that Tidal will add $9 monthly to the base subscription.  As per the digital trends article, ""*For those who want to be able to access the Tidal library via* [*software- and hardware-based DJ tools*](https://tidal.com/djs)*, an add-on fee of $9 per month will be needed.*""

Over the past couple of months, Serato and djay Pro removed the ability to use Stems; separate tracks for voice, drums, and rhythm with Tidal's streaming music because they say it falls within a different licensing/copyright tier. Could this additional $9 per month bring back the ability to use Stems with Tidal? Or is this just a new DJ tax for the privilege to connect Tidal streaming?  


Apple Music recently became available on djay Pro without increasing its subscription cost. My take is that Tidal is going to use the additional $9 from DJs to bring back Stems which would be pretty awesome. What do you think?

Was booked for a surprise birthday, where the hubby wanted danceable 90’s music and I prepared a few different genre crates since 90’s is one hell of a broad of a term. 3 hours in and not a single one of the genres drew more than 2-3 people to the floor, and the requests for 80’s, top 10, grunge, eurodisco, underground hip-hop, trance etc. were piling up. When the planner came over with his phone and a top 1000 Songs from 1970-2020 ready on his Spotify I nearly just packed up and left, I felt like a total failure at this point. But I straightened my neck and started freestyling all the sing-along, top songs from every era and genre I could think of and miraculously made the night end on a highnote with nearly all on the floor dancing and singing their brains out. But, the first few hours still haunt me, I felt so utterly useless and ill prepared. Time to dig into the crates and make a ton of 3-5 songs mini-crates of every genre known to man and be sure to get a bit more info from the planner upfront.

Idk, I sound like I’m fighting myself in this post lol. I just would really like advice. I want this negative feeling/thoughts to calm down. It does motivate me to want to improve but it feels really shitty, I start to doubt myself and abilities a lot which makes me reluctant to practice or want to book gigs. I’m taking a 2 month break from gigs to focus on improving and doing mini projects but any advice is welcomed.

One thing I’ve notice as I’ve been on this forum is that there are many types of dj here. This gives us a great range of perspective but it also causes some tension and conflicting advice. For example when asking about reading a crowd, one will advise to check your ego and play what makes the crowd happy, while the next will say fuck the crowd play what you feel. Or on the recent festival post some people advised to preplan your set while I find that blasphemous. A lot of these opinions depend on what kind of dj you are. If you’re a wedding/open format dj maybe it makes sense to go with the crowd, if your playing a mainstream festival, maybe a preplaned set is better, while for underground djs it makes more sense to showcase your abilities as a selector and play a set that’s spontaneous.

I think it would be helpful to know what type of dj is asking questions and what type of dj is giving advice. In the sports sub reddits, there’s a flare next to your username for team/player affiliation. I think it would be useful for us to identify our background so our perspectives are contextualized. Maybe some tags could be by genre/style “House”, “Open Format”, “Hip Hop”, or by event type “wedding”, “underground club”, “bedroom dj”, etc

How do you back it up?

FWIW I'm on a Mac but I am open to switching to Windows. I honestly prefer Windows but heard that Macs are better for DJing which is why I have been using them.

So, I used to use iTunes (which is now the Music app) to catalog/manage all my music and playlists. A lot of these playlists were smart playlists (to show songs by genre, or by decade, or to only show clean edits or remixes, etc.) but some were also ""top hits during the summer of 20xx"" type playlists.

Then I would just open up Serato or Djay or whatever and it would seamlessly integrate with my iTunes library and all my playlists would be there for me to perform with.

This worked great for a while; however, every few years if I upgrade my operating system (or the computer itself) the music library will often just obliterate itself and I'll get some stupid error.  I still have all the mp3's safely on my computer, but all my playlists get hosed. Because I use a Mac, I can't just easily (if at all?) downgrade the operating system or the version of the iTunes/Music app, at least not without erasing my entire computer which is a massive inconvenience.

Yes, I back up my library. But it seems that the way the iTunes/Music app imports/exports your past library database file changes every couple years and the support from Apple around this issue isn't very helpful so I'm stuck rebuilding all of my playlists again.

I'm sick of this happening...what do I do?

a) Buy a dedicated laptop just for DJing and never connect it to the internet/don't update it? But then, if that computer ever breaks down I may run into the same issue, right? Plus what if I need/want to buy an new controller, and then that controller requires a newer OS...then I have to update again and I may face this issue again.

b) Take screenshots of all my playlists every so often so I can remember what they were and remake them? This seems super lame but I guess it could work although it would be a massive time suck.

c) Use a better music organization program? This is what I am leaning toward but I would prefer to not lock myself into something like Rekordbox, in case I want to switch to a different brand of controller later on. Does anyone have any recommendations?   
c) Any other suggestions or tips?",1709232692.0

How the scheduling goes is the DJ plays a warm up set for the first hour then the band plays, DJ plays during their set breaks and the last hour of the night. Lately the venue is pushing the idea of whoever the DJ is should be handling the live sound for the band from sound check to finish. Currently, they are paying someone next to nothing to get by but are looking to let them go soon. Some bands bring their own sound guys. The rotation of djs have very little live sound experience and aren’t there often enough for training to really stick in my opinion. For the djs, we are getting paid the normal market rate to play for a few hours in between the bands. Venue has a nice pa and lighting system.

My thoughts on this:

#1 DJ’s are not live sound techs. Obviously there are live sound techs that DJ on the side and vice versa.

#2 I believe the venue should either hire a dedicated sound guy or require all bands to bring their own. Given the amount of money this place makes I can’t see this going over budget. Having any band come through and sound great every time as oppose to having a DJ struggle through a rushed sound check and trying to troubleshoot things like feedback, mic placement, changes in crowd density that can effect the mix throughout the night. Customers do and will take notice. 

Thoughts and advice would be much appreciated on this 😊

Right now the gameplan is assume the majority of the crowd is still coming in, use the first 15 minutes to play popular songs / edits that invite people to the dance floor, ramp up to 3 or 4 different bangers, then taper off for the last 10 minutes to cool the crowd done for the next artist.",1709192930.0

Allow me to go ahead and spit it all out here, so long story short; I’m a DJ who is also the producer DJ in a dance pop duo and we’re based in both Tokyo, Japan  and Christchurch, New Zealand which is why we’re not actively playing shows ATM. However, I think any DJ will relate to that you moment when you have a new project to work on and you start daydreaming about your dream set up.

Recently, I’ve been going back-and-forth as well as making some progress on my set up. 

I’m definitely someone who would consider themselves a producer / dj as opposed to dj / producer and I would also consider myself a controllerist by nature. (My first foray into dj-ing was “scratching” and playing samples over nu metal songs with the dm2 mixman  my parents bought me for Christmas back in the early 2000’s -_-0) 

I mention all this to paint a picture of my dj-ing style. I love using the gear in a “band dj” kinda way. I’ve dj-ed in several bands and also bring my S4 to club events so I can maintain my playing style. 

Anyways, as I mentioned before I’m starting to day dream about my dream set up for my new dance pop duo as we are finishing up our debut EP and my wife is “allowing”me to splurge on gear. 

The goal would be to have a four channel set up so that I can use three tracks per song (live version of the song, a hot cue scratch track, along with a scratch track for scratching) and then have an extra track to use as an interlude in between songs. 

I also love kinetic energy, via motorised platters, but I don’t necessarily need four of them. 

I would love any input on which set up idea you think would suit my needs best. 

Tracktor Kontrol S4 mk3 with two Rane 12 mk2s (Along with a 13 inch MacBook Air with an external monitor, I have poor eyesight )

Or 

Denon Prime 4+ with two SC6000m primes 

I’ve already bought the S4 and the MacBook Air, for another project of mine, and bc I needed a laptop. But I wouldn’t mind taking my time to invest in a set up that would bring out my creativity in a live setting. 

I also plan to use this set up for writing music for this specific project as I want to be able to create with the tools that I will use to play the songs back.

I originally wanted the two Rane 12s but I don’t like the fact that the hot cues are placed at the top of the unit and I feel that that might kind of take me out of my flow when it comes to playing hot cue parts and  scratching.

My current setup is 2 xdj700s (not running HID) running into channels 3/4 of an S4 MK3, with the S4Mk3 running the supreme screen hack, with the intention of using decks A/B for stems/ remix decks.

I'm also using beat link trigger software to sync traktor as a slave to the XDJ700s via ableton link.

Due to the supreme screen hack being broken for stems/ remix decks on the s4mk3 & usage of ableton link to sync up those 2 decks with the XDJs, it defeats the point of having the s4mk3/ jogwheels on that channel, I'm also looking to get more comfortable with pioneer mixers effects units for when playing out, and having a setup that's easier for friends to plug and play with, so the switch seems to make sense

The intention is to sell the s4mk3 & purchase a pioneer mixer (750mk2/ 850/ 900nxs), all of which appear to have USB soundcards, meaning I can run Traktor in 2deck external mixer mode, sending the 2 traktor decks to 2 decks on the pioneer mixer via USB, and having the 2 XDJs running into the other 2 channels 

In order to control those 2 decks within traktor (2 stem decks or 1 stem deck + 1 remix deck), I'm unsure if a single F1 would be enough, or if i'll want an F1 + X1 or 2 F1s

Ideally i'm looking to still use the internal traktor FX on individual stems channels too, but I could possibly just map an LPD8 if needed

I would like to check with you if moving to a Xone 92 would make a big difference in sound quality/mix pleasure?

Or would perhaps adding some modern external phono preamps (genre ART DJ Pre II) to the Empath even get me a better sound VS the Xone?

I only need two channels though. The Xone's 4 band EQ looks to be a nice improvement to sculpt the mixing more, together with the filters and LFO.

Maybe there are other mixers to consider.
Had couple of years ago a Super Stereo DN78 rotary, but found it impractical, no panning, radio interference, imprecise, muddy. I like long mixes, but also fast cutting. So a rotary doesn't look to suit me well.

Please leave me your ideas, so I can move on in my mixing/sound journey. Thanks 🙏

By using the Control One, you would bypass the need to have the usb dongle for one.   


I have been running the Control One for a few gigs. It works. The thing I don't like about is the touch slider and the mini screen. I don't find it useful during live gigs when I am focused on mixing primarily. I have seen a few people online using the Akai units. What I do like about that is that it has mechanical sliders which would make it easy to dim things on the fly. But I am not sure what the cons of the unit are.   


The control one works within SeratoDJ and VirtualDJ as tested. Not sure if the Akai unit needs some other sort of software running in order to work. The Soundswitch software when running performance mode has the exact button layout as the ControlOne, so its easy to make quick changes and still be able to see what your changing. I know the ControlOne also has dual usb, something I don't use.   


Wondering if anyone could also comment on speed and any input lag etc. I am assuming the Akai gets plugged into the computer usb as as well as the SoundSwitch getting plugged into another USB. The SS plug is where you connect your dmx output to. ",1708660455.0

Or... who learned on vinyl?",16,1awti1g,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1awti1g/pioneer_dj_alphatheta_and_industry_standards_or/,61,"I wrote this as a reply to that other post about Denon DJ now having a shot at becoming ""industry standard"". I don't know why but the post was deleted. Anyway, I'd love to hear what other DJs think of my take, especially those who've come up through the change to digital.

TL;DR - The main reason Pioneer DJ became the industry standard in the first place is because the old standard bearer (Technics) didn't offer what the changing industry wanted. Pioneer will remain in place (regardless of the brand name) until they no longer provide what the industry needs, even if competitors manage to beat them around the margins of price and features.

Original comment: 

Here's my take looking back.

I  think about the last time the ""industry standard"" changed: from  Technics 1200s to CDJs. Pioneer DJ rose during a crucial transformation  in the industry, and their product did something that the incumbent club  standard *could not do*. 1200s  can not play digital music files. CDJs didn't just do what the previous  king did, but better, or at a lower price point. They did something the  previous standard couldn't do\*

So, I wonder, and I suspect, that Pioneer DJ / Alpha Theta / Whatever will only fall off if and when they can *no longer perform the essential function* of the brand leader, which is only this: provide gear that does what the industry wants

\*I realize DVS muddies this argument to some degree, but: I'll maintain  that what Pioneer brought to the table with their players was better  suited to industry needs as the digital revolution marched on. IIRC,  Phase was only launched in 2018, so until then DVS required not only a  laptop, but needles, for chrissakes. Meanwhile the CDJ2000NXS2 was  already out. DJs wanted digital, and the difference between a NXS2 and a  1200 with control vinyl presents a stark contrast between solutions to  that problem. Much more stark than a CDJ3000, and another product that's  marginally cheaper and marginally better. Know what I'm saying?

It was more of a visual association with the music and the sleeve.

In this CDJ/MP3 day and age how do you even start to form some sort of fimiliarity with your tracks? I'm sure DJ's have hundreds or thousands more tracks now then if they were Djing when it was predominently vinyl, yea some MP3s have little thumbnail fake sleeve images, but looking on a CDJ or laptop it's just text?, I understand you can have folders, but it's all essentially just lists to go through.

I find it easy to flick through a physical collection and think ""oh yea I try that one"", but I just don't have an association with the music by looking at track titles on a screen, even if I know the artists or title of the tune i'm looking for, anyone else have a similair problem?

Also how many tracks get lost into the ether this way, at least with physical media you have it there infront of you and it can jog a memory while flicking through, not squirreled away on hard drives or lists, never to be played again because hundreds of other tracks have superceeded it? so how do people keep a tabs on what they have, by memorising the artists & track names only?

I have been DJing for around 6 months, but been doing gigs for the last 2 months. I have thoroughly enjoyed the gigs I've played, however I always get INTENSE nerves before I start, which leads me to fuck up some transitions and overall perform at a much worse level than I do in my room alone.

600,Dj Booth - ideas for adjustable width?,0,1avrd9h,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1avrd9h/dj_booth_ideas_for_adjustable_width/,5,"I'm in the middle of a reno and looking for ideas for a DJ booth that should be around 4ft wide for my own gear, but adjustable to make it wider when friend comes over with his gear on occasion and we play 4 decks with 2 mixers. I'll have less space after the reno is done, so that's why I'm looking for an adjustable booth that can be out of the way and as small as possible when not in use, but very quick and easy to expand out when the moment arises.

I use a Xone 96 and CDJ 2000's w/ MasterSounds FX + isolator and he uses a Rane MP2016 and XDJ1000's, so we probably need 84"" of total width when he comes over.

He's an inch or two shorter than me, so the side he DJ's on can be a bit shorter if needed, which would help it tuck into my side when it's not needed.

I was thinking about either a 'swivel' design or a 'booth in a booth / nesting table' design. Pics below for some context. Either way, any design would need to be strong enough to support the gear and must have heavy duty castor wheels to allow them to move around.

I figure there must be some pretty interesting ideas for working in smaller spaces.

Any suggestions for booth designs you have seen that could work?

Thanks very much!

Curious on what everyone's take is on this. Obviously there are situations where playing full songs are more than acceptable (playing for events, galleries, weddings, parties) where your music is second to the event, but in a situation where you are the main focus as a performer I feel awkward/anxious just playing a song and standing around. is this something I should just not worry about or what?

Ran it well for about 2 years, a few issues with the venue over equipment and payments caused enough issue for me to have to stop the night.
I posted, letting my amazingly supportive friends know that I wouldn't be able to DJ there for that event anymore.

Here is where the issue lies: I let my ego go. I asked, if they had to keep running the event *I created* without me, if they would please just change the event name. Every bit of promotion for this event was all done by me, everything was tied to me and my Socials, you couldn't bring up this event today without it leading right to me.
 The event was Me being the DJ, so if people come expecting me after I had to quit, they would be disappointed.

I got a lot of push back and vitriol on my ask, but was eventually able to compromise and change the name. The event died anyways not long after I left, and I think it was mostly due to the venue not offering the replacement DJ half of the offer I got, and the one vitriolic pusher being a douch canoe about the event. 

Was it really disrespectful of **me** to ask the event name change because I was no longer able to run it? This is weighing on me as I want to resume my passion, but knowing the people that pushed back, they'll drag this up and start the rumor mill against me if I don't step up and address this first.

Took my RX2 in for repair because a CUE button was broken, and mentioned that the fader caps on the two channel faders keep popping off and would it be easy to fix them. A couple of hours later I get an email saying the repair is done with an invoice including two full fader assembly replacements. I called up to query this; they were very apologetic that an internal miscommunication had led to the repair being carried out without my approval, but they were adamant that the full fader assembly had to be replaced. My question is, could this be the case given the faders functioned fine, just the caps kept flying off? I know they use P-lock to attach, so the only way I can see this being the case is if the metal stem of the fader had worn down to the extent that the P-lock could no longer attach. Is this possible/likely?

Frankly if they'd told me this was necessary before carrying out the repair I might have just opted to superglue the fader caps back on rather than pay £35 a piece for new faders. I don't plan to gripe about it though as long as I know there wasn't a cheaper way to repair them properly. Thanks in advance for any input!",1708443879.0

But I am fascinated by quick-mixing because it seems so antithetical to what I grew up with going to clubs.  The first time I heard it done was so upsetting to me as a music fan because some of the best parts are at the end, especially if somebody like Patti was on vocal duties.

I am very curious about quick-mixing (especially hip-hop) vs full songs, beyond personal preference.  Do audiences prefer it or did DJs just start doing it (to look busy or something) and people expect it so DJs do it because people expect it because....

Are the songs (in general) these days just not good enough to play it all out?  But I hear people quick mix classics too and it feels so odd to me.   They used to play out a song like Taana Gardner's Heartbeat or Lil Louis French Kiss til the end but not anymore it seems.

What is the theory behind quick-mixing that has made it so prevalent? 

On the flip side is playing full songs of say deep house or trance. For example La Tour Hypnomaia is a track that has high and lows and slow parts and other weird sheet going on.  But a lot of stuff people say the play entire tracks of I sounds like burning man music and just stays in one place for ten minutes with no real journey.  Even Icy Lake by Dat Oven seemed to go somewhere even if it was pretty repetitive.

Background - I'm in the UK. I have my trusty 1200's which are nearly 30 years old, 2 x XDJ1000mk2's, a CDJ1000mk3, Circuit Tracks, EFX-500.

* In the mid 90's: Just 2 channel Synergy crap mixer
* Late 90's DJM-300
* This decade: DJM-450
* Then a DJM750mk2
* Dabbled with an Ecler WARM2

The 1st WARM2 didn't play nicely with my Korg mini effects unit, the 2nd WARM2 popped and broke, as such I have no faith in another one.

The 750mk2 is capable, but it doesn't sound amazing. Also the effects are.....well, junk. I like the echo, and that's probably the only thing I use in earnest. The colour FX sound terrrible to my ears....ok, noise is fun to play with when you cut it in and out, but that's it. Dub echo and the filter are unusable.



So, I have a fair amount of kit, but don't always use it all together. I like rotary, that would mean Mastersounds Radius 2 / 4 given I'm in the UK, potentially an Ecler WARM4. I like the idea of the Xone PX5 as want that analogue sound, the effects all sound very similar, but hey...I like an echo!

The DJM A9 is a no. The V10 - dunno. Xone 92 is a hard pass as is the 96.

So, what else am I missing?



Is it really down to:

1. Radius 2 / 4
2. Xone PX5
3. WARM 4

But now I have to use the big CDJ’s (2000 or 3000’s idk yet) and I am looking for some advice. 

Things I have done to prepare already:
-Bought some good USB-sticks for my music
-Downloaded Rekordbox and put my Serato crates on there and flashed it to the USB’s
-Bought a second-hand DDJ-400 so that I can use Rekordbox DJ to practice with my new library (a lot of tracks are in different places than Serato)

I have always just turned up, put down my gear and started playing, I can play for 6 hours with all the music I have, which I have done plenty of times. But now I am playing 1 hour on gear I barely know (aside from yt videos). 
I have used CDJ2000’s once before in an empty room for about 30 mins but that only gave me time to know my sticks work and to get to know how the library scrolling works lol.

Last night I was playing on the above CDJs in a club in London, I had all my tracks prepared so that they start with hot cue loops and ended on active loops. Tried them all on my XDJ 700s and they worked fine. 

On the CDJ 2000 NXS v1 decks the only way I could exit each loop was if slip mode was turned on, otherwise the 'reloop exit' button would do nothing and I’d be looping forever.

 However, then the only way the active loop would work was if slip mode was turned off again, otherwise it would ignore the loop altogether. Then it would have to be on again so you could exit the loop again…

So this meant I had to learn this behaviour quickly (after a few embarrassing mixes) and remember to turn it on-off-on for every mix I did… so much more confusing than on the XDJ 700 and XDJ 1000 decks that I’ve used.  

Is this how all CDJ 2000 NXS (v1 & v2) decks work? Or were these just acting strange? 

They were a bit battered and the sound tech guy didn’t know how to connect the monitor to the mixer so I don’t have much trust in the venue to know what they’re doing!

",0,1at93no,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1at93no/philosophy_on_mixing_and_producing/,18,"TL;DR: Producers keep producing amazing songs and DJs keep mixing amazing songs

So I just wanted to word vomit something I've been thinking about in regards to producing and DJing. I myself am not a producer though I surely will make the plunge to find my own voice in that realm eventually. So that means I mostly focus on my mixing and curation skills to make my sets feel dynamic and new. For me I find most of my satisfaction with DJing to be when I forget trying to easily flow from one into/buildup/breakdown to the next and simply try to make the songs ""talk"" to each other. What I mean by that is... think about your own voice, you know the sound of it so intimately and you know the almost imperceptible changes that happen to your voice on any given day. As Producers you are making tracks that feature your voice and they are what get you moving and it's a beautiful thing to witness. Now think to when you are with your friends/family/coworkers... to hear other people's voices and how they react to you and even react to themselves when they are around others. There's an almost childlike wonder in that discovery right?? So for me I like to see how other people's voices (songs) react with a each other and mix through both of them for as long as I can maintain the ""conversation"" and like the natural flow of a conversation there are points where one party is dominating and other points where it's a harmonious back-and-forth and that's how I see myself as a DJ. Don't get me wrong everyone has therlir own style when it comes to showcasing their work but since I don't necessarily have work of my own the way I can find my ""voice"" in DJing is finding that happy centerline between 2 or more songs that create this ""conversation"" in the mix that can't be replicated truly unless you record it because with that I don't like finding one flow within a Playlist and that is my set like a child I like to choose new things try different combos so it's all the same Playlist but never the same songs together so I can find different ""conversations"". I'm not sure if this will resonate with Producers and DJs of the like but all I'm saying is your (producer's) voices while amazing separately are brought up to an even higher level when they are allowed to ""communicate"" with others to even further show the oneness that is your voice (song).",1708195705.0

Hello everyone,

I'm in need of some advice to optimize my setup involving an NS4 Numark DJ controller, an Apollo X4 UAD interface, and a MacBook Pro. My goal is twofold: achieve zero latency for my DJ controller and utilize the Apollo X4 to route Autotune and other vocal mixing effects through microphones during live sessions.

Current setup details:

* NS4 Numark DJ controller connected to the MacBook Pro via USB, requiring separate power.
* Apollo X4 UAD interface connected via Thunderbolt 3.

The issue I'm facing includes a slight, yet noticeable lag when using DJ apps, and I'm unable to use the headphone jack on the controller for cueing. Moreover, I want to simultaneously connect my DJ controller and Apollo interface to manage live vocal effects efficiently.

I believe the challenge lies in the specific routing or configuration needed to use both the USB controller and audio interface together seamlessly, especially for live vocal processing through the Apollo.

Does anyone have experience with this kind of setup or any insights on eliminating latency, enabling headphone cueing, and effectively routing vocal effects? Your suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

So recently I finished a mix and shutdown my Denon SC Live 4, pressed confirm on shutdown UI notice before realising I hadn't saved the mix :( . Luckily I was able to get it back and wanted to share my experience for others who might get into this little mess.

I thought at first the file would be deleted as nothing was on my usb. Had no idea where to start with all these data recovery sites as most are just BS and want your money. Luckily I found something called Recuva. Same company that makes CCleaner which you might of heard of and I've used for years, which I was surprised at.

Got the usual message about paid version ect ect but got the free version instead, don't waste you're money. Free one had what I wanted anyways, to get my mix back. Installed and ran the recovery search, hoping and hoping it was there. Didn't use their ""deep scan"" as it said about extended time to scan.

After a little while it showed some of the files I deleted before and luckily the mix was there! Pressed recover and checked it and was all good!

Of course not everyone may be lucky in getting their mix / tracks back but I wanted to share this as I'm sure there'll be someone in the future with the same issue. There's lots more data recovery software out there, probably hundreds of different software that work great too, this is just what worked for me.

What i’ve tried so far:

Networking 
Ive been networking for years but im not all that great with people it seems, I’ve just been talking to people or at least trying to. I’ve been going to mostly smaller parties in my area seeming with bigger parties its impossible to even get close to djs. I do get to play at some house parties every 3 months, but this isnt really getting me anywhere seeming usually theres about 20-50 people there.

Emails, emails upon emails.
Long emails, short emails, casual emails, business emails, mass emails, personal emails etc etc etc

Talent gigs and competitions 
I landed quite a few of these over the years and won a few prizes, but it all ended the same met new people but nothing happened

Radio gigs/livestreams
Played about a dozen of these, really fun to do but so far no luck at landing actual gig

I can go on with things ive tried, but i think you get the point. The reason i put it here in the first place is to avoid having to type that 20 times trying to explain it to people in the comments. Ive put my entire life on music, studies etc but its getting so depressing the last months.

I would bring my laptop with rekordbox and my music, some speakers and simple lights, and a friend would bring a DDJ-800, so we could have a party with the whole group.

Normally i always prefer to use my own gear, but i have an Opus and a FLX4; the opus is way to big to bring on a holiday and the FLX4 is a bit basic, so the DDJ-800 would be a great step up from the FLX4.

At the evening of the party, we are setting up the speakers, lights and eventually the DJ setup. However, at that moment we found out that the power adapter of the DDJ-800 isn’t working anymore! At that moment we tried to find a computer shop for a replacement power supply and drove over, but unfortunately it was hard to find a universal power supply with the right connector.. Even when we found one with the right connector, it didn’t connect that well, and didn’t provide a steady connection. (a small bump against the cable or connector resets the controller)

At that point we had a few options:

* Cancel the party
* Playing music through spotify
* Try to play/mix music in rekordbox with keyboard and mouse

This is where i was getting quite frustrated, i was really looking forward to this party, had some great tunes prepped and was ready to raise the roof!

Cancelling wasn’t really a option, the group was expecting a party and looking forward to it.

So I decided to do the party with rekordbox without a controller…

I almost never play through rekordbox (i prefer standalones), so that would be quite a challenge.

In the small time I got left, I looked up the hotkeys for cue/play, so I could start a track with the keyboard and then mix with the crossfader using the mouse. No EQ’ing possible, but i’ve got to play the cards I got dealt…

Then I even found out it wasn’t even possible to prelisten to tracks. Even though i had rekordbox hooked up to an external mixer with USB, i was expecting to be able to use the internal soundcard for prelistening.

When the party started, I needed a few tracks to get the hang of using the mouse and keyboard for mixing, but i got there.

It was an all-round party, so luckily i didn’t need to beatmix every transition. I used beat sync for the beatmatched transitions and kept them short because i couldn’t use EQ.

I know my music quite good, so i could pick tracks without prelistening, and used the waveforms to ‘read’ the tracks and decide on starting cuepoints. (for some tracks they were already set)

In the end we had a great party! Maybe not the best transitions, but the whole group enjoyed the tracks and had a great evening! I never want to mix with keyboard and mouse again, but i’m very happy it worked out quite fine.

This party just confirms again that mixing skills and gear are really not the most important, it’s all about track selection and track knowledge.

Could the party be better with the controller? Yes, probably! (and a lot easier!) Would the crowd notice? I don’t think so, most of the group didn’t even notice I was playing just from my laptop.

TL/DR: Had issues with the controller when setting up the gig, played the gig with mouse and keyboard without being able to prelisten. Still blew the roof off! It’s all about the tracks ;)",1707905384.0

My solution to this is [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0B8X6H96S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

My idea is this: get these adapaters, plug them into the USB-C ports on the decks and leave them connected. Plug my USB-C cable into the adapter rather than the port of the deck. This will save wear on the port. If the adapter starts to wear down, no biggie, i can replace the adapter and i'll be good to go for another x-y years. This potentially avoids the need for sending off the decks for USB-C repair, or dealing with awkward intermittent connection issues.

Two things:

1. Kyle Chaka is an OG tech journalist and is worth reading
2. A few key quotes below:

> In his new book, The New Yorker staff writer Kyle Chayka outlines why he thinks algorithms are ruining a person's ability to develop unique taste. Mathematically determined recommendations on social media, streaming and other platforms are deciding what music, food, art and entertainment becomes popular, he explains. The algorithm promotes the widest possible average, ""informing the songs we listen to, the friends with whom we stay in touch,"" he writes, warning that culture is getting homogenised as a result.

Also from another quote:

> Monoculture is stronger than ever, he noted, pointing to how people across the world are consuming the same narratives and aesthetics being pushed across mainstream media. 

>""That's not where I listen to music or look for music–I go to gigs, I listen to radio and I talk to my friends,"" he said. ""Subculture is just nowhere near the stuff we're being shown.""

That last paragraph is gold.

First set was fine. Totally happy with it and the crowd vibed and danced to what I played. 

For the Sunday set, I knew I needed to bring something different, but for it still to be ‘my’ sound. So, as a hip hop/funk/breaks DJ and it being the last day of a three day festival, I complied a laid back collection of slower beats with nice bass lines, that a crowd could sway along to.

The DJs before played Afro house, ecstatic dance and ended with techno. The crowd were really up for it and dancing along furiously. This is when I second guessed my decision and instead of starting my set as I had planned, I dropped some breaks to keep the crowd dancing at the pace that had been set. It kinda worked, but the novelty of raving in the afternoon wore off, so I reverted back to my original plan and slowed it right down to 80-90-100bpm beats and it worked. The crowd swelled in numbers, the head nodding and swaying I had imagined beforehand was happening, and the Sunday summery vibe was set. I just wish that I had trusted myself and not tried to follow on from something that someone else had built.

But soon i reached the limitations of Flow8Deck and moved on to rekordbox with the help of MixedInKey. As a newbie I was still unsure where to put my hotcues and how to beatgrid and MixedInKey helped me with it. 

Nowadays I do not consider the automatic cues of MixedInKey helpful although i still import them with the Cue and Key tool most of the time I end up deleting them. 

This leaves with only the key detection, which is probably good enough to do it just with rekordbox and remove a big part of my new track workflow.

What are your experiences with MixedInKey do you consider it useful?

Based in a country where it's very hard to find mixers. By asking around, I have managed to find two mixers: The Pioneer DJM800 (4 channels) and the NI Traktor Kontrol Z2 (2+2 channels), both used.

My setup is a pair of CDJs and one (but sometimes two) turntable(s). I need a mixer mostly for home use with the occasional gig, but nothing crazy in clubs. Just chill, radio-show-style gigs where I just cue one track after another.

Now the DJM800 is being sold for $370 and the Z2 for $520. The Z2 is in a great condition (purchased in 2018), while the DJM800, while not heavily used, comes with a broken crossfader and a broken knob that needs fixing. I am considering it because I don't really scratch DJ.

My budget is up to $400. Is getting an old DJM800 worth it in 2024? I checked its prices in Japan and it still seems to be in high demand and is going for much higher prices (probably because it has achieved classic status?), but from what I read online, the sound quality on the DJM800 isn't very good and it also doesn't come with a sound card built in?

The Z2 on the other hand doesn't need any repairs, but would I overpaying if I'm getting it for $520? Purchasing the mixer here does cost more than getting it elsewhere because of the import tax laws in my country.

I would really appreciate it if someone here could share their thoughts on what I should do.

Please keep in mind that I can't consider other mixers because they are simply not available in my country right now.",1707635125.0

Loaded up the Apple Music back-up on new laptop 15% of the catalogue had missing tags, genre, artwork and playlists. I've since gone through every track and updated the tags, removed duplicates etc (not the missing playlists yet). 

Is this a common problem? 

I wanted to organise all my music ASAP (quite organised as all on one place and genre/artist/title tagged) before I load up into Serato/Rekordbox. 

However, now that I have finished updating the incorrect tagged library I am keen to move away from Apple Music and maybe just use folders instead as this has been a hassle and want to avoid for any future back-ups. 

I am considering creating new folders specified by genre/year. Apple Music creates all music as Artist>Album>Title. I wondered, is this as easy as just dragging tracks directly from Apple Music and dropping them into a folder (EG Electronic, Disco etc). Will all tags cross over if I was to do this.

Ideally want to be able to do sort it in a clean way so that any future back are a breeze. 

Final thing - I've read you can't update file names in DJ software (Rekordbox/Serato), so if you do play your tracks from folders only (with no Apple Music/lexicon etc) how do you name your files with the correct genre/artist/title etc? As there is only one box area to update any standard filter on Mac.

The club was new and the town was small. On average, maybe 10-20 people a night. It was bad. Management had no idea what they were doing and their marketing attempts were nonexistent. It didn't help that the other clubs were much more established and had a pretty good monopoly on the area.

Around Christmas time, there's an annual pub crawl called 12 Barz. Each city has their own set of venues and lucky for us, our club was selected as one of the stops. Management decided that this would be a great opportunity to hire an artist to perform and brought in JRDN. Throughout this period, they marketed the event nonstop and made a new JRDN post every day.

Fast forward to the night of the pub crawl, I arrived and had music on for 10. Around 11, the group arrives and the club is fully packed. Everyone's having a great time singing and by 11:15, it was empty again. I don't think the owner realized that they would just be coming by briefly because he looked shocked. JRDN arrived with his crew around midnight and we ended up talking for the rest of the night. He didn't end up performing and no one else showed up afterwards.

This was by far one of the saddest gigs I've ever had. The next saddest gig I had was for a birthday party where the guy rented out a big ass venue and only 10-20 people showed up. In terms of sheer scale, this one was definitely worse. The owner just looked so defeated afterwards that I don't think he ever recovered from that night.

741,Question about fees for international festival gigs and travel,5,1al2bsc,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1al2bsc/question_about_fees_for_international_festival/,6,"Hey so this is kind of an awkward / newbie question but for the first time ever I'm in a position where a festival wants to book me for a prime slot and has asked for my conditions.And I feel a little lost on what to answer.

It's not my first international gig but usually clubs and promoters just offer me a certain sum and I accept in any case because I'm just happy to play and visit the country. I have no agency backing me and still feel quite new to all of this (1 year playing official gigs), so I'm not great at negotiating for myself.

I'm not sure if I should ask for the same amount I would get at a local, regular club gig or if international festivals are different? Of course I'm going to ask to have travel expenses and accommodation covered. But should I ask for a higher fee since I'll be traveling for most of the weekend and can't play other gigs as to compensate for the potential loss? The set would only be 2h but I would either have to travel 10h by train or half a day when flying.

What else should I be asking for? I usually just send out a tech rider with my minimum requirements but I've seen other DJs ask for meals, breakfast the following day etc.I want to be professional and not sell myself ""under value"" but I'm afraid of asking for too much just for them to end up ghosting me.... It's a small, local festival but taking place in a rich county in Europe and it seems like they have some funding. They've also invited much bigger names than me in the past so I feel a bit intimidated lol

I was mainly a hip hop/open format DJ. I was just talking to an old DJ friend and he told me he quit 2 years ago because he simply couldn't keep up with the sheer amount of music and requests for unofficial youtube/remixes/tiktok songs. 

When I was DJing, Billboard top 40-100 was the backbone of my entire night set. Whatever was at the top of Billboard was my peak bangers that would for sure get the dancefloor filled. So as long as I had all the top billboard songs, I'd be mostly fine for the night.  I'd have a crate my old school classics that didn't really change. 

Then I'd have niche crates for subgenres that were hot at the time like an EDM crate, a dancehall reggae crate, a bmore club crate. To keep up with those it took being in the club bar scene and just seeing how crowds react to these rarer tracks that you don't hear on the radio. It also took a bunch of scouring forums, record pools, and record shops to get my hands on these rarer tracks.

Now billboard is far less relevant. There's not really a singular chart, top 20, or MTV/BET/Radio countdown that you can follow to know what's popular. TikTok and social media dictates alot of what music is popular. Sometimes old songs all of a sudden become popular like Fleetwood Mac Dreams blew up because of that guy skateboarding drinking cranberry juice. There are so many avenues to discover music that it's overwhelming. How are DJ's today keeping up with all of it?",1707256044.0
747,[How-to] What to do when your SoundSwitch autoscripts are suddenly empty after syncing your (Denon) Engine DJ library,6,1akjlej,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1akjlej/howto_what_to_do_when_your_soundswitch/,2,"I recently had a bit of a nail-biting experience where I spent a long time autoscripting 100+ tracks on SoundSwitch for use with Engine Lighting on my Prime 4, only for the contents of the scripts I made to completely disappear. I thought I had lost a few dozen hours of work, only a couple days before my next gig. I couldn't find any definitive (working) answers on other forums, and support is rather slow given they're on the other side of the globe from me. I figured I'd share the dumb mistake I made and how I fixed it so that someone else may benefit down the road.

\---

**Here are the symptoms relevant to the situation:**

1) You have gone and autoscripted some tracks for use with SoundSwitch.

2) After syncing your library with Engine DJ, your autoscripted songs now show up blank, as if they've never been analyzed or scripted.

3) The ""SS"" logo may still appear in SoundSwitch next to the songs you previously scripted.

4) Clicking ""Rebuild TrackMap"" does not fix anything, and if #3 was true, the ""SS"" logo is now gone as well.

5) When you look in the directory for your SoundSwitch project, you still see plenty of .ssfile and .ssa files.

\---

**Here is what happened in my situation:**

I had foolishly been creating autoscripts \*directly on my Prime 4's internal SSD\*, not on my computer. What this means is that rather than accessing my music library on my computer, which I then sync to my Prime 4's drive, I accessed my music directly on my Prime 4 from SoundSwitch.

*Why this is a problem*

The way SoundSwitch identifies tracks is by inserting a custom metadata tag on each song you create an autoscript for. As far as I can tell, Engine DJ does not sync track metadata back to the library on your computer. Therefore, even if Engine DJ says ""new data to sync"" from your controller back to your computer, it's not going to copy over the custom metadata SoundSwitch inserted when you created a script.

However, when you sync from your computer over to your controller, Engine DJ \*will overwrite\* the metadata for your library, including the songs you created autoscripts for. Since the tracks on your local library don't have the custom SoundSwitch metadata tag, that tag gets erased on your controller during sync. At this point, due to the TrackMap, SoundSwitch will likely still show an ""SS"" logo next to the tracks you created scripts for, but clicking on those tracks will show you a totally empty file as if you haven't done any work. Clicking ""Rebuild TrackMap"" will ruin things further because SoundSwitch will examine your music library, search for its custom metadata tag in each song, find none, and then wipe out all ""SS"" logos because it did not find any music file with the tag indicating it has a script.

\---

**How I fixed it:**

Based on what I've already described, you may have an idea of where this is going. After figuring out how SoundSwitch works with music files, here is what got me back on my feet:

1) Open your song or library directory with a music tag editor such as [MP3Tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/).

2) Click on the track you want to re-attach an automation to and press Alt+T.

3) Click to add a new tag with the name SOUNDSWITCH\_ID. The data field should contain the \*precise\* name of the .ssfile (found in your SoundSwitch project directory) which corresponds to that particular track. For example, if I know that the file {D65B6572-A50F-4C5F-AD6E-8FE1E6546102}.ssfile corresponds with the track in my library called ""I'm Good"", I'd open up ""I'm Good"" in MP3Tag, click it, press Alt+T, add a new field with the name SOUNDSWITCH\_ID and the data {D65B6572-A50F-4C5F-AD6E-8FE1E6546102}.

4) Repeat this for every. single. track. Tedious? Absolutely. Better than losing dozens of hours of work? Also absolutely.

*However, this begs the question... how in the world do you correlate .ssfile names with their respective tracks?*

This is where things get really tricky, and where I honestly got really lucky. I had created a playlist for my gig, and had gone down the list from top-to-bottom creating a script for each track. Therefore, I was able to sort my SoundSwitch project directory by ""Created At"", start with the earliest-created .ssfile, know that correlated with the first track in my playlist, and then move down from there. 

If you created scripts at random, things are going to be much, much harder for you, and you may spend more time trying to match up tracks to .ssfiles than you would just completely re-doing the scripts altogether. Do note, however, that correlating the wrong .ssfile to the wrong track doesn't hurt anything as long as you don't save. You can open it up and it will be very obvious that things don't match up. Looking at the script itself may also help you to know which track it actually belongs to!

\---

**After all was said and done...**

It took me a couple hours to correlate metadata tags to the 100+ tracks. This time, of course, I made sure to create the scripts while navigated to the library on my \*computer\*, NOT on my Prime 4. Things looked good, I synced using Engine DJ from my computer to my Prime 4, and everything finally, finally worked.

Hopefully this helps someone at some point, or even better, helps someone to avoid making the same dumb mistake I did. Needless to say, I've been thoroughly enjoying SoundSwitch / Engine Lighting despite some quirks and needed improvements, and look forward to what they do in the future.",1707251062.0

Hey. I’m Roman. I live in New York City, and I’ve been a high level nightclub DJ for about five years here. Played in just about every club in NY. people tell me I’m one of the best. I don’t have a big head about it, but I know I do pretty well, and I’m looking for further opportunities to grow, progress, and make money.  I’m feeling stagnant after running laps around the circuit and not getting any further ahead financially. (I’m a full time DJ). I want to devote more of my time to music production, but am in a weird place.

I’m well aware that the real money is in corporate events, traveling and private events, though I have a great website and great visibility in the city, I feel like I don’t have the contacts for this type of work.

I do advertise myself as the cool club DJ on my site -Romanchappelle.com, because I didn’t want to be seen as a birthday party DJ or cheap mobile DJ.  I wanted to be seen as underground and club cool, and am ultimately an artist. it worked out, I built my brand well, and I’m trusted at what I do at many high-end clubs and hotels as well as the underground.

Now I still want to be cool. I produce music, and I travel, playing in aspen next week- but I’m also aware that I feel I’m leaving money on the table by not pursuing more of the right mobile gigs. I have got a few inbounds on my website for events, but not nearly as many as I’ve got talking to people.

I have some equipment I would like to do more high end corp/brand gigs, consistently.  Nike, fashion, Google parties etc. 



I’ve signed up for bark and thumbtack, but I don’t want to do 16 year old birthday parties for 300 bucks. That’s not worth the money I spend on gear and transportation. I can also make that during a club night not bringing any gear, usually more.



I’m looking to work with higher end clients- $1500 and up. Do you all have any experience with PR companies, and larger event producers? Goals are gigs for fashion week, large corporate events, and industry conferences. As a New Yorker I know these things happen every single day and have done work for Tissot, IMG, soho house, etc. The frustrating part is that I am in touch with agents annd agencies, the gigs are just so infrequent that they’re almost 1 a quarter. 

I haven’t broken in consistently yet.

Being vulnerable here, as a full-time nightclub DJ, I sometimes feel like I am struggling to survive financially, even while I am doing the flashiest gigs, and playing the best clubs in the city, and do make $300 an hour more than occasionally.

At this point I’m well aware that my mathematics are in need of more consistent high end clients, and nightclubs just don’t pay the bills. Do I need to be signed to an agency? Should I start my own? Maybe it’s a marketing issue- and if you look at my Instagram, I have removed a lot of my nightclub work because I’m starting to replace it with artist cntent, my own music, and better branding, because I no longer just want to be seen as a nightclub guy.

I’ve already received the basic guidance of check out agencies, network more, etc.  looking to ask for some experienced perspectives. I don’t want to leave any more money on the table. I eventually plan to be able to sell tickets at more major venues, and be more of an artist doing big numbers, but getting there, I have to pay the bills.

  
I am also a copywriter on the side, so I know how to do a bit of marketing. Looking for any smart guidance, preferably from people who’ve done it before. ",1707243535.0

The guy I’ll be going back to back with is a friend of mine, but his genre is super melodic, happy, slow house tunes that you’d expect at a Martin Garrix show. Not ideal. 

I told them to change it but they say nothing can really be done. I had the closing slot (2nd best slot) and prepared a great hour long set with my music.

The battery is gone and the universe is telling me it's time to move on. 

I have recently got a job where I'll be DJ tutoring everyday and want something new. I'm trying to work out what is the cheapest laptop I can buy that will run Rekordbox smoothly (I use a DDJ-RX which doesn't take USB). My tracks are all on a hard drive so won't need loads of storage. 

My thought process behind getting one as cheap as possible is I want to have this laptop solely for this job. So in theory it just needs to be able to run Rekordbox and check work emails, maybe browse the web - that's it - other than that it'll be clean and unused. I'm never gonna use it to play out, as I'll use a USB stick in that case. And as for Ableton I'd like to buy a PC/ Mac and set up a proper studio.

This is really only going to make financial sense if I can get a laptop pretty cheap. Like couple of hundred quid if possible. I'm in the UK and saw these deals on Currys website:

I have about 3k songs that I collected over the past 2 years, but as my style is evolving and me not being picky when downloading songs I decided it was time to trim down.

This is how I'm tackling my problem: I go through all my songs in Finder on my Mac, then move songs I don't need anymore to a separate ""Archived"" folder. After that is finished, I want to remove all songs from my Rekordbox library and re-analyze the ones I kept. 

Also currently, I have separate folders in Finder for each genre. However, I want to change this to one big folder with all my music files and tag each song in Rekordbox as I make a lot of use of smart playlists. In the end, I want my Rekordbox to be organized and not the files on my computer, as the Rekordbox library is kind of the ""ground truth"".

What do you think of my approach? I think this should work for me, however, I want to create a good system/workflow that would make my life easier in the future, and I also want to avoid re-doing my library in the (near) future.

I need your advice!,11,1ai1jt9,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1ai1jt9/first_dj_gig_went_absolutely_terrible_i_need_your/,228,"So, a bit of context. I’ve been a bedroom DJ for almost two years now and I consider my DJing abilities to be quite good as of now as I practically master stuff like beatmatching, transitions, etc. I also have a music library that’s quite large (I ONLY play EDM, so mostly House, Trance, Techno, etc.). Up to this point I’ve only played for myself in my own bedroom as a hobby (always having a blast), and a few times on very small gatherings with friends (not so much to play entire sets for them, but mostly to show them my controller and my music), but I consider my abilities and music library to be good enough to play at a club or festival anytime without any issues, or so I thought until last night. 

The whole thing was a shitshow, let me explain. So yesterday was my friend’s birthday and she decided to throw a party at her lake house. She asked me if I could bring my stuff and play a set at her party, and I accepted (for free). I’ll admit that I didn’t prepare at all as I hadn’t practiced for days, hadn’t sorted my new songs, hadn’t even analyzed them on Rekordbox or set up hot cues (which I always do), etc. I was aware of all of this but I didn’t give it much importance as I had come up with killer sets on the fly in the past even with songs I had only listened to once, and people at raves are usually too drunk/high to even notice small mistakes. 

But there lies the problem, this was no rave, this was a house party. At most there were perhaps 12 to 15 people, AT MOST. Mostly distant ‘friends’ and acquaintances, people who’ve known me for years, and for most of them this was the first time they found out I’m a DJ. When I arrived the atmosphere was practically nonexistent, just a bunch of dudes and a few girls just sitting down, talking in small groups separated from each other or looking at their phones. I was even surprised and I thought I had arrived way too early, but turns out the party had already been going for like 3 hours. And the thing is, I know these people, and I know that they don’t listen to any EDM at all, so when I saw them while coming in I felt worried, but I didn’t make too much of it and said hi to everyone and had a few drinks and a few laughs. 

A couple hours later my friend asked me if I could start DJing and I said sure, thinking I might be able to maybe cheer everyone up. While setting up I started to feel a bit nervous (normal, it was my first gig after all), and as I started to DJ the people approached and some of them started dancing a bit but literally after like 2 or 3 songs most of them just walked away, I wondered if perhaps I started too strong as I opened with some light trance, but perhaps that was too much for them and I should’ve started with some generic house instead. Either way, I tried for a much funkier direction instead (nu disco, funky house) but none of them came back, there were only like 4 dudes left who weren’t even dancing, just staring at the visuals on the screen (I think they were high). And then there were this two drunk assholes who would constantly approach and start ""cheering for me"" but like in a derisive way while also mocking the way ravers dance and then they would leave laughing, or they would approach me and start playing with the jog wheel or twisting the knobs without my permission basically fucking up my beatmatch. 

I reached the breaking point when two dudes just straight up started harassing me. One of them would constantly approach me telling me that I had been playing ""techno"" (it was house, but whatever) for like 3 hours (it had been ONE hour tops) and demanding me to play Hip Hop instead. The other one would just stand by my side and start telling me that he ""wasn’t feeling it"" and that I should play better stuff, or he would just stare at the computer screen and ask ""how much longer?"" or say ""you’re taking too long"". Everyone looked so fucking bored and I felt so pressured because I felt that maybe they weren’t having a good time because of me, like maybe I was forcing my music down their throats or something. At this point there was basically no one sticking around so I just unplugged everything and left the fucking party. 

I was so fucking angry and I felt extremely humiliated and embarrassed, and the thing that enraged me the most is that the birthday girl and the other 3 people who were asking me ""when are you gonna start DJing?"" the entire party just walked away after like 10 fucking minutes, so why did I even bother? Especially the birthday girl, she made me feel like a dancing monkey, a circus freak, a novelty to show to all of her friends that she can just throw away when she gets bored of it. I then felt extremely sad because when I got home I opened the IG story of a friend who stayed at the party and it looked like everyone was having a blast. It was like as soon as I left the party, they were finally able to play their Hip Hop music and have fun. I have to say that not everything was all that bad, the few actual close friends of mine that were at that party were actually enjoying themselves and dancing and asking me with real curiosity stuff about DJing or the controller or the software. 

So my first gig was a nightmare, and I’m left wondering what should I do. One the one hand I LOVE DJing, it’s my favourite pastime and my way to decompress and relax after a long day. I’ve also considered having it as an actual job because I’m a producer and I think it would be a nice way to promote my music, and also because I love raves and because you can travel a lot with this job. On the other hand, I’m seriously questioning my abilities because maybe I’m not as good as I thought I was and maybe this job is just not for me, and also the thought of dealing with this bullshit every time (drunk assholes, song requesters, dead crowds) is just appalling, I’ve always known that these are a DJ’s worst enemies (almost cliche) but having finally interacted with these people and these situations in the flesh felt way worse that I thought it would tbh. Also, what worries me is that this is a small town and word could quickly spread that maybe I’m a shitty DJ which could impact my career prospects (I don’t even live here anymore anyways but who knows, what if word reaches the town I’m currently living in?). Ugh, I don’t know what to make of all of this.

I’m sorry for this long ass rant, but I felt that if I didn’t get all of that out my head would explode. So what do you think guys? What should I do? Maybe next time I should prepare better and stick to a theme? I think I’ve learned my lesson to NEVER DJ at a house party ever again unless its packed and I’m sure the assistants enjoy EDM.

Edit: Just to clarify some things for some people in the comments, I acknowledge I fucked up by not preparing beforehand, that was my mistake and I learned the lesson. To be fair though, the host knew I exclusively play edm (for the moment) and she said it was alright, that the guests would like that music, and I took her word for it. Also one of the reasons this didn’t work out is because the party was supposed to have more than 100 guests, and I guess she was expecting it to be like Project X or something, of course it didn’t go as planned. I’m not saying the audience was wrong and dumb and I was right and smart, they were right to be bored, it’s just that I didn’t have a good time during my first live performance, that’s all. Also, I’m a girl, not a guy :)",1706981983.0

ich wollte mich mal erkundigen, ob es DJs gibt, die mit ihrer Tätigkeit Geld verdienen und gleichzeitig über eine Agentur vermittelt werden. Da ich von Agenturen bislang keine Rückmeldung bekam, wollte ich es mal hier versuchen. 

Mein Frage bezieht sich auf die Struktur der Zusammenarbeit zwischen DJ und Agentur: Stelle ich mir das so vor, dass es Leute gibt, die sich als Freiberufler - falls man es durchbekommen hat - gemeldet, ein Kleingewerbe angemeldet oder welche Rechtsform, die einem passend erscheint, gemeldet haben und dann nur über die Agentur(en) vermittelt werden und dieser dann einen prozentualen Abschlag zahlen? Lässt man sich über die Agentur vermitten und vermittelt sich zusätzlich in Eigenleistung? Oder ist man bei einer Agentur wie in einem Angestelltenverhältnis und muss sich dann um nichts mehr kümmern? Gibt es Erfahrungen für Abwägungen?

Ich hoffe, ich konnte meine Frage verständlich darstellen und bin für jede Rückmeldung dankbar :)

Hello dear community,

i wanted to ask about DJs that are earning money with their work and are simultaneously placed with an agency. I didn't receive responses from some angencies to date so i though i could try to find an answer here.

My question is about the cooperation between agency and DJ: Is it organised as if you registered your business - as a type of legal form that suits your expectations - and then are ""distributed"" by the agency / agencies exclusively and they keep a payment in advance? Or do you get ""distributed"" by the agency / agencies and simultaneously look for gigs by yourself? Or is it like a regulary employment at a company so that you don't have to worry about anything furthermore? Do you have any experiences for consideration?

I hope i could make you understand my issue and i'm thankful for every response :)",1706958632.0

I wondered if there’s a setting on Serato (that I can no longer gain access to) that might be overriding the cue slider?

I have never used serato and can’t now with this mixer, but i feel like I must be missing something obvious that is overriding the cue slider? (I’ve checked the ‘master cue’ is off. It still works and plays only the master output when selected)

803,Quick Mixes,11,1ah7qsw,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1ah7qsw/quick_mixes/,30,"So, sometimes, at home, I'm just doing a quick demo in a certain genre, for a specific venue or event. Or I'm just trying out a stack of new downloads or testing out some changes to my livestream setup - those mixes always turn out to be the most fun to play and, when I listen back the next day, the recordings are always my favorites - really fun to make and always super fun to listen to. I'm talking like 30 minutes where I'm just winging it, ripping through ten or more tracks in record time, not worried about letting them play out *at all*. Just mixing in the next one as soon as it feels even reasonably decent to do so (which is sometimes only like 30 seconds). Each track gets an absolute max of 3 minutes, including mix-in/out time, usually less. This applies to Deep House, Tech House, EBM, Disco, Bass, Glitch, Club/Party tracks, Jazzy Trip-Hop, Downtempo, Lounge, whatever, by the way.

I've never played a live set this way, I feel like I'm always out there kinda milking it for time, letting tracks play out, long-form (and sometimes feeling, and probably looking, a little bored), which is stupid because I always have 4+ hours of tracks I want to play for a 2-hour set and have to pick a short list. I guess, obviously, I should try ripping through more tracks, quicker and solve both problems at the same time.

As far as my experience can tell, it just feels totally fresh and funky and fun the entire time, both to perform and to listen back.

Does anybody else play this way, feel this way? I mean, *I know people do this*, just curious if anyone has a point of view or some experience to share or something.

Edit: Also, usually the really good ones come when my mindset is ""this is a throw-away"" recording that I have NO intention of sharing/posting. And then, for some reason, it's the best one I've done in weeks.

829,I dunk on VR DJ’ing but I may have seen the light,0,1ag7gj3,DJs,https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSFR5H7Ke/,50,"So I’ve been harsh on VR DJing in the past.

I still am not sold on VR _only_ DJing as a replacement to IRL partying, but I just saw this stupid TikTok using the Apple Vision Pro and the penny dropped for me. 

VR DJing will always be a niche thing, but AR in DJing is likely be huge someday. 

One of my biggest (and perhaps only) dislikes of digital DJing with laptop and controllers today is the song selection interface. 

Simply put, scrolling a list of words comes nowhere close to the physical, spatial, visual and tactile benefits of flipping through a record bag to find your next track. 

The combination of putting records that go well together next to each other (spatial), having an emotional or intuitive memory of a track triggered by the album colour or art (visual), and physical / tactile selection of 12”’s cannot be beat when it comes to song selection. 

I’ve imagined physical ways of reproducing this in the past through some kind of rotating midi drum and screen combo (cc u/rutierut) but nothing really stuck. 

Now.. watch that video and imagine having a physical record box full of blank cardboard 12” sleeves, with QR codes or fiducial markers on them. Instead of seeing code, you have a Vision Pro or cheaper, next gen equivalent headset on which  displays album art on it. And instead of taking the record out of the sleeve, you just select it and it cues up in your digital player of choice. 

Infinite access to your digital crates, all the benefits of 12” record sleeves and organisation, but none of the downsides of lugging actual vinyl. 

I never saw an immediate use case for VR in DJing, but I would absolutely pay for something like this. 

Virtual controllers and mixers are still useless in my opinion, but a hybrid AR/physical library browser and an IRL mixer set up would be an absolute delight for me.",1706781154.0

Will I need to invest in some external storage? Will I need editing software? If so, which? Should I record the sound live from a mic or is there a better alternative?

I’m an italian Dj with almost 15 years of experience and more than a few gigs under my belt, but I’ve never had to deal with something like this: a cultural non-profit organization recruited me in order to host a 10 lessons DJ workshop for teens starting at the end of this month.

We are expecting 5-10 teenagers to sign up for the course, ranging from 14 to 17 years old, without any DJing experience.

I've already started sketching down a basic course program for the 10 planned lessons, including vinyl vs digital mixing, a sprinkle of DJing history, the differences between mixing styles, and so on, but the thing I'm having trouble with is deciding what hardware the kids will be practicing on. 

I own a Pioneer RX2, which I'm planning to use as my theory-practice explanation device, using a projector in order to let all the class see what I'm doing. I am not entirely convinced about letting the students use my device, as there is a risk of damage, and the students would have to take turns practicing one at a time, leaving the rest of the class bored to death.

The best solution, in my opinion, would be getting a few all-in-ones the student can share in pairs, trying to stay on the budget side. Also, I'd love them to be standalone devices, without requiring computers/tablets/phones to control.

Is there any particular hardware model you can suggest me?
How many students should I group up for each device, taking turns practicing?

Thank you colleagues, you are the best.

EDIT: Some info I mistakingly left out: the non-profit organisation will be budgeting the event, hence I'm not on a specific budget but ""the cheaper the better"", you know..
The workshop will be free for the kids.
My go to choice would be using mixing hardware: I understand all the advantages of apps and mobile softwares, and by the way it may actually end up as my choice, but I think learning to beatmatch by ear is way more solid as a fundamental than beatmatching by looking at waveforms. 
Or, maybe, I'm just biased by the way I learnt the profession when I was just starting up.",1706724363.0

871,Use of FX Send from Traktor to Numark M6 USB...possible?,1,1adwu30,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1adwu30/use_of_fx_send_from_traktor_to_numark_m6/,5,"Hi everyone! I hope you're all doing fine.

I recently bought the Numark M6 USB mixer for my studio to replace my old and used DJM 800.
I was aware, that the M6 doesn't have any FX Unit, but as I love to use FXs, I'm trying to figure out a solution/workaround.

I'm using the Traktor DJ software and connect my computer with the mixer through the Traktor A6 Scratch device.
On this interface, you have a specific output channel, which you can use for FX Send. (There's an official documentation about it)

The idea would be to connect this channel with one of the 4 main Line In of the mixer, through a RCA cable.
Therefore, is it possible to use one of the 4 main channels on the M6 to receive the FX signal, and use it so?
And can I use it without to setup any FX Return? (as it's no use for me)
Or do you know any other way around?

I hope everything in my message is clear enough...otherwise tell me :)",1706539192.0

Throwaway account.

I think I need a bit of a reality check to see if i’m justified at being mad at my local clubs or if i’m being ridiculous.

For context:
Club A (biggest club in my city) i’ve been speaking with since October. The manager there originally said they would get me on within two weeks, but they never open my messages on insta. Every time i go into the club to speak to the manager they act all friendly and just say it’s been busy but they’ll get me a gig within the month. Obviously this hasn’t happened and I feel like i’m just being strung along.

Club B recently opened within the past few months. I’ve been emailing them and they were pretty keen to get me in to play and i’ve even played there once. They originally said my music was too fast for them (they were playing house and I played techno) and asked if i could change up the vibe. I agreed and sent them a house mix. They then stopped replying and i’ve heard nothing even after multiple follow-ups. This week I see that they’re now playing techno which has annoyed me a little after asking me to change and then ghosting me.

Also, just for more context, i have a small following and DJ regularly at Club C (2nd biggest club in my city) usually as headlining/closing act might I add.

Would love someone else’s thoughts on this situation.",1706515162.0

I keep getting recommended by friends, or someone I know reaches out directly.  It's fun, but certainly more of a ""Every once in a while side gig"" for me that brings in some side cash.

Today I'm coming here looking for advice on how much to charge for a gig.  I'm in northern Minnesota, and this gig was in a local rural town.  I gave about 10-11 hours total of my time for the gig between prep, setup/breakdown, and the event itself.  I ran music for a few hours, did some emceeing, and also co-hosted a live auction and raffles.  I didn't end up doing all of the emceeing, because one of the presenters wanted someone else to introduce him, so we tag teamed it.

My time is valuable.  I realize that more as I get older (I'm 26), but at the same time, I don't want to overcharge for something that didn't end up completely being my gig in the end even though I provided the equipment and curated the music.

For an emcee gig with music like this, how much do you charge?  Per hour, or flat rate?  Does ending up with a co-emcee who's not connected to you and your service change things for you at all?  These answers that end up on this post will help shape what I charge going forward, so thank you for your time!",1706470992.0

I've been using Traktor for 15 years and was gifted an NS6ii some time ago, and it has been collecting dust in a corner, as I'm not fond of Serato and don't intend to switch over. I recently pulled it out and started creating a map of all the basic features (cue, play, volume faders, etc.).

I wanted to move on to the more complex aspects involving Midi Out. After a lot of trial and error, I mapped the volume of Decks A and B to the appropriate VU meter (ch01.cc.031 and ch02.cc.031 respectively). When trying to map the Master Volume to the controller's LED, I discovered, when checking the drop-down list of midi out options, there are 16 channels, each has 127 ""sub-channels"" and about 30 additional ""notes"" that can be assigned to a function. Meaning there are thousands of needles in the haystack when searching for the right one!

My question is as follows: is there any way, any software, I could use to find each function of the midi controller in question beforehand so that I can know what to map to it, instead of the reverse? For example (as dumb and science-fiction-y as it may sound), something that triggers each possible midi channel for half a second so that it lights up and shows me what the right midi address is?

Alternatively, any simpler way to find out how to map a Traktor function (specifically the Master Volume L+R) to the appropriate LED?",1706289844.0

Quick bit of background before getting into the question. I started DJing in 1999 and quit in 2008. Most of my gigs during that time were at afterparties, fetish parties and the occasional club appearance.

After a 15 year break, I decided to start up again at the ripe old age of 50, because I love the music and missed being creative, but I'm happy with just posting my mixes on my Soundcloud page. I really don't care about playing live anymore as I would rather work on my DJ and production skills (which I also started a year ago), than trying to hustle and promote myself in order to get gigs in the small city I moved to in 2022. I also find that this has freed me from dancefloor centric music. I've been branching out into ambient, downtempo and electronica which I would imagine isn't super marketable , especially in my neck of Upstate NY.

Just wondering if there are any other DJs out there who don't care about performing in front of a crowd.

I understand that this model is discontinued, and is basically more than 10 years old.

The price is ridiculous for what it does. They copied what Denon GO did three years ago but slapped their label on it and made it way more expensive. The only benefits are portability, ease of setting up, and “aesthetic.” The controls look terrible, sliders are so small, and it’s missing some key features for professional performance. The battery only lasts 5 hours. It’s not truly “wireless” you have to RCA into a chunky AlphaTheta receiver (which they list nothing about in the website, I literally can’t tell anywhere if it’s included with the product)  The USB input on the back hurts my soul, and don’t get me started on the “Bluetooth audio input enables the crowd to join” lmao 

The problem is, no one taking DJing seriously would invest in this. This is not for clubs, promoters, or anyone in industry. And no one casually DJing would pay that much for a toy like this… unless they had disposable income. Nobody asked for this. If they wanted the rebrand to be taken seriously, they should’ve come out with a more serious product.

I am familiar with recording into pro tools with 1200's, a dj mixer, mixing board and a digi 002. 

I have no idea how to go about doing that with a dj controller and serato or rekordbox (have not made my mind up which one I am going to use). I see people using both in my field but I know clubs favor rekordbox. But, probably not going down the club road again so not concerned with that. 

I assume the dj controller connects via usb to my mac m2 studio and the audio outs go into whatever interface (suggestions appreciated) I decide to buy? 

How exactly do I get music from the DJ controller into Pro Tools, Logic or Ableton? Does serato some how route it to pro tools and both software's run at the same time? Is that a recipe for crashes or not in this day and age?

I think Ableton is more straight forward in regard to connecting from serato with a bridge from what I read. But, I still don't know how to do that.  I haven't read any solid info about pro tools or logic. I favor pro tools because I am more familiar with it, but I have all three. 

A few side questions - can the dj controller and/or interface be connected to a hub or do I have to tie up two usb 3 spots on my mac? Is there a limit on cable length?

I tried reading a bunch of info before posting this but I want to make sure before I buy the wrong controller and interface. I was thinking between rev 7 or flx 10. BUT I really only have room (right now) for the flx 4. However, I read the sound quality sucks so I'd rather not go down that road plus it has rca outs. 

Would a flx 4 sound worst than my old set up? or do cheap sound cards sound worst than vinyl and a good set up?

What is the most efficient way to do this?

My current system:
1) DJing (RekordBox, DDJ-FLX4) PC -> Controller -> XLR Cables -> Studio Monitors

2) Music Production: PC -> Scarlett Audio Interface -> TRS Cables - Studio Monitors

My Current Issues:
1) I can't have the TRS and XLR cables plugged into my studio monitors at the same time without getting a loud buzzing feedback during production.

2) I can't plug my controller into my Scarlett Audio Interface without getting latency issues while DJing


TL:DR 
How do you personally connect your audio interface (Scarlett), DJ controller, headphones, studio monitors, and your PC together and with what cables to streamline your setup and avoid latency issues?",1706056374.0
960,How to transcend a niche?,2,19e3j5e,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/19e3j5e/how_to_transcend_a_niche/,6,"I've been DJing themed club nights for a few years now with one events company. My most recent gig with them is centered around a very popular popstar and the parties do very well, and more have been popping up in my city with other promoters and I am being asked to DJ them.

I am very grateful for the opportunities but I'm growing tired of this celebrity's music and am capable of doing much more interesting things. I would like to move beyond this, but I'm feeling stuck on how. I worry that if I message another promoter about an idea, they can just run with the idea with their existing network. I do try to set myself apart by making my own remixes that I exclusively play out at my shows, and they go over very well. 

I also feel like I don't have a name for myself in the genres I am personally interested in and I don't know how to expand my network. While my work is quality and expansive, it feels like it's from a different world.
