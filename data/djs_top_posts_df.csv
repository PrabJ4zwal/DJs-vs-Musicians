It’s still interesting that DJ Mag don’t throw in a few DJ’s that definitely are in the Top 100 to keep a semblance of credibility.

The fact that the likes of Dom Dolla and Mau P didn’t even poll as well just speaks volumes.

1001tracklists Top 100 Producers list is far more indicative of who the top DJ’s are, even if they’re ranking them on someone completely different.

Seriously though. You may have great skills, impeccable taste, and an amazing ear, but that doesn't make the kid rocking parties from his iPad not a DJ.

You may have an impressive library of rare wax, and the skills to blind beatmatch early 70s disco in front of a thousand people... But that doesn't mean the boomer playing top 40 tracks with sync, to  100 middle schoolers... Isn't a DJ.


This mentality is just protectionism, gatekeeping, and insecurity.

Stop being bullies, and start encouraging, teaching and improving. And quit believing in this idea insecure people are poisoning your mind and heart with.

This last week, my stepmother passed away. We weren't too terribly close, but this is still quite a task to deal with. My father rented out a large space and we're expecting hundreds of people to show up (She was a very popular gal) . This isn't going to be a standard funeral, but more so a celebration of life with an emphasis on making this a party. We want to have a good time, not be sad. A family member will be there and will be DJing for a few hours. After that he has a different gig, and then I have to be the DJ for the remaining 4 hours. My step mother always wanted to see me play but never got the chance so this is in my opinion something she would have wanted me to do. I however am primarily an EDM DJ...

My concerns are that obviously a lot of electronic styles of music aren't suitable for this type of event/crowd. I now have 5 days to prepare music for this. My step mother was in her 40's and I would imagine a huge range of age and demographics in the audience. Another note is that we live in a somewhat rural area and you see a lot of folk listening to country and rock, which I am very uneducated about. 

So what should I do as to not disrespect my stepmother and not offend anyone attending? I figured greatest hits of the 70's 80's and 90's but It seems overwhelming to somehow acquire all this music. I am starting to panic. It wasn't even as if I could have declined to offer to DJ. That would have been very rude. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.",1571694671.0

Definitely getting some new Turntables (work tables). Need a new mixer/controller. I need the hole 9 yards. I have a budget of 10k, to get me started. I need everything. My XONE :62 is still a beast.

My sound is a mix of trance, organic house, folktronica, dnb, with a splash of shrooms. I like to layer tracks heavily. Not into scratching. I don't want to press a bunch of buttons with stupid noises. I just want my vinyl to work along side my digital music and I want to be able to extremely refine the sound.

49,Vinyl fetishism is bullshit,518,hiibkc,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/hiibkc/vinyl_fetishism_is_bullshit/,300,"In response to this poor guy having an existential crisis because people are shaming him into using vinyl, I just wanted to say, **vinyl fetishism is pure bullshit.**

- You don’t need to play vinyl to be a real DJ. 
- You don’t need top of the line gear to be a real DJ. 
- You don’t need a million followers to be a real DJ. 
- You don’t need to play EDM to be a real DJ. 
- You don’t need to be attractive, wear certain clothes, or look a certain way to be a real DJ. 
- You certainly don’t need Pioneer CDJs to be a real DJ. 

Yes, vinyl sounds better _sometimes_. Crate digging is fun _sometimes_. The look and feel of a 12” sleeve and a record is satisfying _sometimes_. But there are also a million downsides to vinyl as well, all of which means preferring vinyl is a personal choice if you’re wealthy and obsessive. It has NOTHING to do with being a quality DJ or knowing how to rock a dance floor. 

Being able to beatmatch by ear is a fantastic and very helpful skill. That should be essential no matter what medium you’re using, but let’s be honest, even _that_ isn’t necessary for a lot of people. 

Being into vinyl as a passion is 100% fine, but buying into the whole “vinyl only” culture _to the exclusion or judgment of others_ is cowardly and insecure. 

I’ll just say it. Nothing says “I’m an insecure elitist who isn’t confident enough in my skills or self worth to stand on my own, so I have to hide behind my wallet and my false sense of pride” than insisting you have to play vinyl to be a real DJ. 

Don’t fall for it. It’s bullshit. Do your thing, rock your sound, make people happy, keep dancing. You don’t need vinyl.

A while back I released my VJ website [shapiro500.com](https://shapiro500.com) where you can play all my looping visuals in-browser as an easy way to throw up some visuals for a show. I first posted it here a few years ago, and just recently updated it to include some of the suggestions you had when I first released it.

* You can now tempo match the visuals to your music by tapping the spacebar
* You can download them all in 1080p instead of just 720p
* You can download one by one OR a zip file of all \~70 videos
* You can set the duration of each vid to a certain amount of beats

Let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions. You can use these for free in concerts, events, livestreams, or any kind of performance.

100,Gig from hell last night,417,nnyu6a,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/nnyu6a/gig_from_hell_last_night/,107,"Booked a graduation party for last night.  I had played a graduation party there last year and it was a rager.  The family is pretty well off - country well off.  I set up in a tent with a dance floor in their back yard.

Anyway, got to the gig and started.  The dance floor was packed - 200 people from all over in the tent. One dude comes up and stands by me, clearly wants to talk.   He tells me he's a DJ and asks if he can use the mic if I'm not so he can do his thing.  I say no, of course.  Then he wants to looks at all my music.  I asked him if he used Serato - he had no idea what that was.  I turn my back to grab something out of my bag and he gets on my mic and starts talking in some stupid voice saying stupid shit. I tell  him to get the fuck out and don't touch my shit.  He says he has 3 million followers on TikTok.  I ask him ""What the fuck is TikTok?""  (I'm 50, he was maybe 19)

Someone throws a beer a little I while after that, I get on the mic and chew the asshole out.  So things are going pretty good.  Then the drama starts.

One of the daughters asks me to make an announcement.  There are so many cars that they were parking on the rural highway blocking the road.  The dad wants me to stop playing until cars are moved.  So I stop and make the announcement.  And wait.

10 minutes later the dad comes up to me and says ""Party's over, go home"".  So I start to shut down.

The mom, who hired me and had already paid me, comes into the tent and tells me to start back up, ""You're playing until 1!!""  She's pretty drunk by this point, but I do it anyway.

Another 10 minutes and the dad comes in and says ""I'm the boss, shut it down, party's over, everyone go home.""  So I just stop the music and have a seat.  Mom is going to show back up, soon.

She does, and proceeds to chew me out.  I told her she needed to get with her husband and decide what was going to happen before I started playing again.  She gets hot, pulls the ""who's name is on the check"" card and tell me to start playing.  All right, this roller coaster is moving again, music is back on.  She waited for him at the entrance to the tent.  I figured there was going to be domestic violence at this point.  I tried to think of a song for the forthcoming altercation, so I cued up the Rocky theme (Gonna Fly Now) waiting for the fireworks.

I get two songs in and BOOM, the power goes off in the tent.  Dad pulled the plug.  My laptop is the only thing in the tent with juice.  I figure it's really over this time so I start to pack up.  I'm pissed, because sudden power loss can ruin equipment. (Everything checked out OK)

The dad comes up while I'm tearing down and apologizes for the scene and makes sure she paid me.  I pack up and go home.

What. The. Actual. Fuck?

In retrospect, was there a better song I could have cued up for the potential donnybrook between husband and wife?

You’re NUMBER ONE JOB as a DJ is to know and curate a lot of music, preferably music both you and your crowd love.

Why in the hell would you take a gig you don’t have the material for?

Would you agree to fix someone’s car without tools? Cook a meal without having ingredients? Teach a class in a language you don’t understand? Of course not.

If you get offered a gig for which you don’t have music, DO NOT ACCEPT IT.

DJs should take gigs in new scenes, experiment with new genres and create new mixing techniques.

Yeah groom was trippin..

Aight so first off, I do not know what led to the breakup. The planner didn’t know and I wasn’t going to ask around lol.

 What I do know is.. this was in no way shape or form a “nightmare gig” the bride showed up and she looked amazing. She wore a skin tight all white sparkle dress (not her wedding dress) and a huge smile on her face. Her whole family was fitted head to toe, they all looked good and were ready for a good time. 

As far as the actual music went, this was some of the most fun I had as a DJ. I took the advice from a lot of you all on here and took requests. A large portion of her family flew in from Colombia, so I learned some new songs. About 45min in, the bride disappeared for a bit and had her “moment”, but  her family was so hype and supportive of her that she was able to mentally escape and enjoy the rest of her night. 

A couple highlights 

- Started pouring rain right as dad started his toast, and one single rumble of thunder happened exactly after he said “I know my baby will always be protected by God” then it stopped and a rainbow came out and the bride took pics in front of it. (I know it all sounds like bs that only happens in a movie, but I promise it did)

- Bride’s family all brought props/hats to party and dance with and they all got used 

- I danced salsa with the bride and didn’t step on her feet 😂

- huge pop for the Macarena 😂

- my “Latin” crate has some shiny new gems 

- I got invited to play in Italy 😂

- tip envelope was heavy 

When all was said and done, everyone sweated out their problems and had a great night. The bride has a very strong support system and I think she’ll be just fine. I truly do applaud the grace she showed, I can only imagine the emotional roller coaster she’s been riding.

Thanks again for all of the input, suggestions, advice & luck this community provided prior to this gig.

107,Arrogant amateur DJ's view of Commercial DJ's: A rant (A long rant),404,ft0mvh,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ft0mvh/arrogant_amateur_djs_view_of_commercial_djs_a/,208,"I've spent the last couple of years quietly building up a rage within me after reading and engaging with hundreds of ludicrous posts and comments on Reddit, Facebook, Intagram & even my Whatsapp chats. I'm a difficult person to wind up, but all these collective minor frustrations have lead me to the tipping point where I desperately need to vent.

Now let me start by clarifying, I don't have a probelm with most amateur DJ's, after all that's where we all started. I do however have a big problem with amateur DJ's that don't know their place.

I get it okay, you've watched a few videos, read a few articles, surfed Reddit for a few weeks and come to the following conclusions:

1. You should probably only buy plain black t-shirts from now on
2. Sync is for people who aren't real DJ's
3. Open-format DJ's are sellouts who don't care about DJing
4. You possibly have the best music taste the world has ever seen, and you're definitely going to go global with your very unique selection of minimal techno

One thing that winds me up the most is their misconception of Open Format DJ's, especially because we make up such a large part of the DJ scene. This idea that we only play the top 40 songs to a crowd full of casuals who don't care about REAL music like you do. 

Before I get into the real lack of logic with that very commonly held view, let me expose you to a simple truth: Unless you are producing music in the genre you love, you're going to find it hard to make money. Sure, you may do plenty of events and have a lot of fun, but it's very unlikely that you'll make a living that way, and therein lies the probelm for those of us that want to do this for a full time job.

If we don't DJ a wide scope of popular music, we won't be getting 3/4 gigs a week paying a living wage, because the demand just isn't there for our niche. I don't think many of you realise that most Open Format DJ's do have a favourite genre, often an underground dance genre, but we've realised that we won't make a living out of that, and we do NOT want an office job. 

Now the main problem: The idea that what we do is easy, and what you do is hard, when in reality it's the total fucking opposite. So you're passionate about Techno and you're adamant that you're only going to play Techno events because Techno is REAL music, right? You're gonna turn up to a Techno event, with a USB full of Techno, and play Techno to a crowd of people that love Techno. It is almost impossible to fuck that up. Don't get me wrong, there will be some minor scope for error in terms of mixing and energy, but other than that, it's an absolute open goal, you know what the people want and you give it to them. 

Open Format DJ's have it easy, right? Just load up the top 40 and play them, simple. Except that notion couldn't be any further from reality. When we turn up to the club, we haven't got any idea what's going to happen that night. We don't know anything about our incoming audience, it could be any number of people from any demographic with any taste in music, and it's our responsibility to figure that shit out as quickly as possible to make sure people stay in the venue.

What if it's a commercial crowd, or a House crowd, or a Latino crowd? What if it's an office night out? What if it's a hen party? What if it's an older crowd? It could literally be anything or anyone. 

I have a solid library of about 15,000 high quality songs across many different genres, and I need to know them inside out, because I can't create a playlist for the night before it starts. I have to be able to adapt and weave between genres seamlessly when needed and be able to raise the energy of the dancefloor from stone cold to jumping up and down. 

*""But I like to show people music they've never heard before and take them on a journey, I'm so much better than all of you""*. Do you think people need new music to be taken on a journey? I can take people from chilled vibing and dancing slow to jumping up and down - singing in absolute euphoria, I don't need some dirty bass house drop they've never heard before to achieve that, I just need to push the right buttons in their brains. The nostalgia you can make people feel playing throwbacks from their childhood & the way you can control their emotions with the vibe of the music is an incredible power to have. 

The scope for error is HUGE, there are so many different ways to fuck that up, so many different ways to clear the dancefloor. And that's why, despite the fact that Open-Format DJ's often have a massive crossover in what music they play, there is still a hierarchy. I know a shit tonne of DJ's like me, some who aren't as good and some who are much better, because there is a lot of scope for creativity and the learning curve is endless. I've played almost 500 nights in the last 4 years, and I'm still learning something every single night.

So a word of advice to some of the Arrogant, probably slightly insecure amateur DJ's I see all over internet: Stop bashing commercial DJ's because you think they're not real DJ's, you barely know anything about the scene and it doesn't make you look cool, serious and professional, it instantly points you out as a newbie. 

Real DJ's have respect for the craft in all it's forms, and they mind their own business.

Every few weeks there is a conversation about “what is the best way to tag your music?” or “how do I build a set?”

One common response is to tell people to sort by genre, key, BPM, and time of night / energy level.

This approach isn’t very helpful, especially for DJ’s just starting out. I’ve got an active collection of about 1,600 songs which I’ve collected over the last 20 years. It’s impossible to remember every single track. It’s also impossible to plan long sets, and planning sets sucks anyway.

So I developed what I call **“The Little Data, Lotta Love Tagging System”**.

**TL;DR: Tag the heck out of your tracks so you can use search to create instant playlists on the fly.**

**Summary:**

Here is how it work in summary. TAG EVERY TRACK SIX WAYS TO SUNDAY. Most tracks barely use all the variables which MP3 allows you to write. Usually they just include information on the artist, track name, release date, etc.

Instead of just using boring Genre, BPM, rating stars, and so on, use all the other columns that MP3’s offer in order to add lots and lots of descriptive information. This could be the vibe, the instruments, the complexity, the intensity, how it makes you feel, the taste it leaves in your mouth, where you heard it first, whatever. The more tags you give it, the more helpful the system becomes.

Once you’ve tagged your tracks with this level of detail, you can do two amazing things. First, create smart playlists in iTunes, RB, Serato, etc. for any combination of moods, venues, or parties you like. You just create a rule in iTunes and it automatically refreshes the tracks in there. They’re always there without having to rebuild the playlist and new tracks get automatically added if they fit. 

Second, and this is where the real magic happens, you can instantly create dynamic playlists in real time for any mood or moment just using the search bar. For example, you might remember the feeling of that “banging acid afro track with the sick grinding bass line from about 2 months ago”, but you might not be able to remember what the name of it was or who was the artist. No problem! Just type for “banging acid afro track grinding” and sort by date and you’ve got it! Same for key matching, BPM, etc.

I call this approach “Little Data, Lotta Love” because it lets you DJ with feeling and spontaneity even if you have thousands of tracks and can’t remember them all. It’s not “big data” because you’re not searching millions of variables on millions of tracks. But it still uses a data driven approach which unlocks tons of freedom and creativity. Adding a “little bit of data” as soon as you add the track gives you a “whole lotta love” later when you’re performing live. 

**More Detail:**

Here is how it works in detail. You should use your own tags and variables (or steal mine), but the process will be the same either way.

When I get a batch of new songs, I first load them into a custom instance of Foobar 2000 (running on Wine on my Mac). Foobar is great because it lets you create your own custom tags with a very efficient workflow. The version I use is adapted from /u/BasCurtiz (thanks Bas!), who describes how to create a custom workflow here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaMbf268BL0). You can create your own version following his method. But seriously, hats off to /u/BasCurtiz for bringing such an amazing system into the world. None of this approach would be as easy as it is without his Foobar 2000 scripting work.

Once you set up Foobar to quickly tag a lot tracks, follow these steps:

1. Tag for overall “Rating”. I give all my tracks a 1 star (for interesting but not frequently played), 3 stars (for a good, regular track) or 5 stars (for special, high energy tracks that I love). I used to be more precise with my star rating system, but could never remember the difference between a 3 and a 4 star track, so this is easier for me and works with /u/BasCurtiz’s default tagging system. This rating gets stored in the track’s “star” tag. 

2. Tag for “Genre”, which for me doubles as a “set time” indicator for house and techno as well as a more general genre tag. Each track gets tagged as:

- Start
- Build
- Peak
- Sustain
- Release
- Hip Hop
- Party Breaks
- Dub / Reaggae
- Jungle
- Funk / Disco

This is helpful because although I play deep house most of the time, I also play funk, hip hop, breaks, etc. at different venues or at different times of night. Doubling the tag values like this lets me search by genre in general, or by a specific energy if I’m playing house or techno sets.

3. Tag by “Mood”, which I save in the “Release” tag. This includes:

- Happy
- Aggressive
- Dark
- Floating / Dreamy
- Emotional / Introspective

4. Next, I tag by “Vibes”, which goes in the “Comments” tag and is based on the following tags. They might not mean anything to you but the point is to use the tags that you find helpful to describe your music.

- Acid
- Afro
- Arabic
- Arpeggiated
- Asian
- Beats
- Bouncy
- Broken
- Classic
- Dirty
- Disco
- Dope
- Dreamy
- Driving
- Dubby
- Electro
- Epic
- Fun
- Funky
- Glitchy
- Goofy
- Grindy
- Head nodding
- Jazzy
- Joyful
- Latin
- Loopy
- Melodic
- Poppy
- Punchy
- Sosig
- Soulful / Musical
- Spiritual
- Swung
- Techy
- Tropical
- Weird

This might seem like a lot, but a vibe can apply to all genres and moods of music. You could have a “middle energy, starting, hip hop, happy” track that is also “Glitchy, dirty, broken, and poppy”. It will sound totally different than a “high energy, peak time, party breaks, aggressive” track which has those same vibes. Make sure to tag every track with *as many tags as you want to describe it.* This is key, because it unlocks the power of magic searching later on.

Also, these tags might not mean anything to you, so use whatever tags you use to describe your own music in the vocabulary that makes sense to you. It could be “fire, banging, crunchy, etc.”, but make the descriptions about the *qualities* of the track, not your *opinion of it*.

5. Next, tag for what kind of instruments the track features most prominently, including the kind of bass line, the type of vocals, etc. This also gets written into the “Comment” section, appended to the end of the Vibes tags. “Instruments” includes:

- Hi Hats
- Horns
- Piano
- Organ
- Strings
- Congas
- Sweeps
- Pads
- Guitar
- WalkingBass
- GrindyBass
- BoomingBass
- Spoken Word
- Chanting
- Singing
- Rap
- Acapella

6. Finally, save all the changes you’ve made, throw the tracks in Mixed in Key to analyze the BPM and key of each track, and then import them to your DJ software of choice. I use Traktor but anything will do. 

Bonus: Occasionally I might even add a descriptive edit to the title of the track itself to help me remember something more specific, but that is always free form and is just there to jog my memory. Something like “CRAZY PEAK TIME RICHIE HAWTIN VIBE” or anything just as a further descriptive reminder.

**Magic Playlists:”

Once you prep you tracks this way, you become like a Track Management God.

Here’s an example of how it use it, with screen shots.

SCREEN SHOTS: https://imgur.com/0fxso1l

Lets say you’re playing Track A, which is the attached screen shots is “Ngeke (Andhim Remix)”. In my system it’s tagged as a “Building” track that is “Floating / Spacey” and is “Afro, Arpeggiated, Dirty, Electro” that features “Congas, Sweeps, Pads, and Chanting”. 

What do you play next? First, I check the tags of the track that is playing (Step 1 in the screen shots). 

Since I’m feeling the dirty afro vibe, I type in “afro dirty conga” in Traktor’s search bar and get a handful of tracks that are also “building”. (Step 2 in the screen shots) Now my options have gone from 1,600 tracks to just 6 tracks that match these tags. 

I see a killer Fela Kuti re-edit from Lego that matches those tags, but also is “broken, driving, epic, funky” and more. It’s also in the same key and close enough in BPM.
I cue it up and give it a listen and hot damn it sounds awesome. Mix it in and you’re grooving. (Steps 3 and 4)

Now we’re a little into the “funky” and “breakbeat” side of things, so I change my search to “funky, conga, broken” and get a different sub-set of tracks that have similar instruments and vibes. Oh yeah, I forgot about that sick Goldboy track that is really fun and joyful, with a great funk bass line and breakbeat.  It’s tagged as “Beats, broken, disco, head nodding, jazzy, and soulful”, with a slightly different but still similar set of main instruments.

Cue it up and fire!!! It’s a perfect mix. I dropped the key down 2 semi tones, which normally would bring the energy level down, but now that I’m in a related but slightly different musical space (with more funky breaks, a walking bass line and a disco loop) it still feels fresh and energetic. The crowd is loving the new direction I’m going, I’ve got plenty of inspiration, and can work this groove as long as I feel like it, make a slight change, or switch it up entirely if I feel like taking a left turn in a few songs.

**Let the Music Move You:**

I read an interview years ago with the legendary Francois Kevorkian, where someone asked him how he plans his mixes. He said “I don’t, I let the music tell me what it wants to be next.” We all know that feeling when it just seems like the tracks are picking themselves, you know just how to mix them without even thinking, and the musical energy flows through you in a beautiful feedback loop with the crowd. It’s just magic. 

If you’re like me and have thousands of tracks, there is no way to plan this kind of moment. The “Little Data, Lotta Love” approach helps me do what I do best (read the crowd, feel the music, let the moment flow through the tracks to create a magical night) by using the computer to do what it does best (sort and process lots and lots of information). It’s better than a “next song generator” like Smoothie or Next because it’s based on *your* feelings and *your* impressions of the tracks, not what someone else played or some algorithm tells you would work. But it uses the best of both worlds to help you create magic moments.

I hope this is useful. Thanks again to /u/BasCurtiz for helping make this happen with his custom Foobar 2000 scripts that I modified to fit my needs. Now go let the music move you and tell me what you think!",1561198670.0

DJing since 94, clubs, raves, festivals, street fairs, etc. As I've gotten older, I've slowed down, and have an older, more aficionado audience at my gigs. Got asked to DJ a house party for NYE, and figured, what hell, I'm going there anyways, it'll be fun and I own the gear.

The household is a group of 47, 35, and 22-year-old roomates. Right after the ball dropped, the 22-year-old comes out with her Bluetooth speaker and asks if I can turn off so she can play. I'm not precious, I'm like yeah ask the crowd. They cheered. I'm like, ""go for it!:

GIRL FUCKING ROCKED IT.  By the second song, all the kids are singing along and dancing. She's just playing songs on Spotify, no mixing, no flair, just an earnest love of the music that she and her friends appreciate. She's screaming to wake the neighbors, and the younger crowd is going nuts. 

A bunch of the older crowd apologizes to me, as I sit back and watch, smoking hookah, drinking whisky and bobbing my head and smiling. ""Nah, this is what it is about. Look at them. They're having the time of their lives, and we've got all the food and liquor.""

20 years ago, I would have probably flown off the handle, like ""how dare you?"". Instead, decades of this shit has instilled one important lesson. Listen to the crowd. 

I had a great time, everyone had a great time. . . and I shazamed the fuck out of her playlist. Hoping to get her behind the decks before St. Patricks Day to see what she can do.

It's really been blowing up recently and seems to stand out. That got me thinking, why? What, if anything, makes it stand out? And what, if anything, does it say about the scene?

My take away is that it's an interesting moment in electronic music right now. It's a fusion of styles and vibes that seems to resonate with people in a way which I haven't seen very often. This includes track selection, mixing style, and audience.

I've been meaning to write it up for discussion, so I outlined what stood out about it for me below. Would love to hear your thoughts.

*TL;DR: Fred again’s set is blowing up and I think it represents a little watershed of a moment, for the reasons I list below. I predict he’ll be huge this year, others will follow in his footsteps, and for at least a few seasons, this sound and vibe will trend hard.*

**Garage meets EDM meets pop meets DnB &** **Dubstep**

First, a lot of his songs mix elements of UK Garage, which has been blowing up over the last 12 months, drum and bass, dubstep, creative tech house and mainstream EDM / pop. He does it in a way that is both accessible to the general public but still authentic to the original genres. It's surprisingly not shit.

Take the transition around 20:00 minutes or so, which is an Overmono vs Lil Baby remix. It's got lush, musical and melodic pads, mixed with huge EDM-style chords, and poppy vocoder rap lyrics by Lil Baby.

This is the kind of stuff I'd usually gag at. But then he blends it with a super tough garage beat and rumbling, dubstep-infused bass line, kind of like a Dirty Bird tech house track mixed with a slower rollers track. It's tough, dirty, original and sick, but also pretty.

Or take his rewind at around 56:00 minutes. Sick raga style MC'ing, devastating bass line, dnb style pullback. It’s actually a Skrillex vs Four Tet vs Fred Again track and it is NASTY. Like at home in any dirty dnb set in the darkest of basements, but then he transitions into an airy, beautiful, proggy feeling track that is dangerously close to EDM. But it still works. Again, a set full of that would make me kill myself, but the combination of these styles actually works really, really well.

There's been a lot of talk about Beyonce or Drake ""infusing life into house music"", which is pure bullshit. But this kind of hybrid is fresh, original and creative. 

The crowd loves it, the viewers love it (it's got a million views in just over a week), and I suspect we'll see a lot of people following his lead in the near future. We might see the underground becoming prettier and more poppy and the overground becoming tougher and more gritty / interesting. And that's not a bad thing, I reckon.

**Finger drumming in public**

Second, his set is one of the more high profile ""controllerism"" / finger drumming performances on Boiler Room, if not one of the first. Of course many people have been doing this for a while but you rarely see finger drumming routines on Boiler Room. This seems to have come as a revelation for a lot of people, as can be seen by the number of TikTok and insta clips of this part of his set, as well as discussions here on Reddit. I predict we'll see a lot of people trying hybrid sets

**V I B E S**

Finally, his set is fucking HAPPY. Everyone is having a freaking blast, a genuine, open hearted good time. Even the part where famous little Tommy Jeans guy accidentally stops the music, the vibe is just fucking lovely. No one is hating, everyone is friendly, light hearted and delightful. It's not a set which is full of itself, gate keeping, over serious or dark in any way. Given all the shit in the world right now, I think this speaks to something people want as well.

**So what?**

It could just be a bit of clever SEO and nice marketing, but the fusion of styles between pop, EDM and more traditionally ""underground"" sounds feels like something different and meaningful to me. 

Maybe I've been hiding under a rock, but I think it's notable and will have a lot of influence on others heading in this direction.

I love DJing, I’m very much into all sorts of techno, house, disco and everything in between, it is a joy to play music that people enjoy dancing to and I’m having a great time when I’m doing it.

However, the „coolness“ of DJing, fueled by constant Instagram/YouTube image cultivation (and I’m not talking about „TikTok Techno“, everyone has an IG account to promote their stuff), the mystification of DJs and their cult status among their peers (à la „I know the DJ“, „I’m on the guestlist“) is irritating to me to say the least.

Like I really enjoy DJing, but I enjoy going to events much, much less because I find myself cringing at all of the above.

Apparently there was a time when you couldn’t really see the DJ. Sometimes I wish we could have this again, because I don’t want to be in the spotlight and when I’m dancing I don’t want to pseudo-religiously be worshipping the altar that is the DJ booth.

Ahhh, I feel much better after hating on anyone but myself again :)

The underrated, the failed, the odd, the weird, the ones that made history.",322,m6kkna,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/m6kkna/weird_dj_gear_the_underrated_the_failed_the_odd/,244,"Hey guys. So lately I got into a bit of collecting a bunch of excentric DJ gear. Things that either failed spectacularly, are severely underrated, too weird, or anything that had potential but for whatever reason just didn't get to be in the spotlight. And maybe even a few pieces integral to the history of DJ gear but a bit more underground.

* [4MidiLoop](https://www.dj-lab.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/4midil_1.gif) a controller that was made completely modeled after the Traktor layout. €1300 priced at retail, this was a really expensive controller.

* [Akai AMX](http://kb.inmusicbrands.com/media/images/akai/AMX_ortho_10x8_media\(1\).jpg) because it got really overshadowed by the Native Instruments Traktor Z1/X1 combo. It works as a legit DVS interface. It even has a mini-Innofader in there and is Serato certified.

* [Allen & Heath Xone:K1](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710xSkt7I7L._AC_SY606_.jpg) it's the little brother to the more famous K2. It's almost exactly the same. Except it doesn't have latching layers nor an audio interface. The K2 is still in production 10 years after its release.

* [Allen & Heath Xone:PB](http://images.musicstore.de/images/1280/allen-und-heath-xone-pb-patchbay-_1_DJE0003548-000.jpg) this is basically a switch for switching between regular throughput and DVS boxes. So you don't have to mess with the back of the mixer pulling out cables and such. Lovely to switch between setups.

* [Behringer DDM4000](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hGitvVW-L._AC_SL1000_.jpg) all my homies hate Uli. But you can't really deny that this mixer quite different compared to their normal sub-par line-up. Especially since it is a fully configurable mixer, almost any setting on this mixer can be adjusted, because it's all digital. Really makes you wonder why no other mixers have that functionality.

* [Casio XW-DJ1](https://d29rinwu2hi5i3.cloudfront.net/article_media/fe4f6c07-f9a3-4574-b385-b28ec222cc68/table.jpg) Casio also made a few interesting DJ and music production gear. Especially Millenium Falcon-looking thing.

* [DJ-Tech DJ Mouse](https://s11234.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Djmouse-Scratch_Tech.jpg) it's not a mouse... It's a *DJ* mouse... It's absolutely terrible, I love it. I just bought a used one just now.

* [EKS Otus](https://www.recordcase.de/media/image/92/fd/f3/1342193703-21952-158ead0b58a03c_600x600.jpg) just look at it. It's basically a MIDI jog wheel controller shaped to fit over a turntable. It even has dual layers.

* [Native Instruments Traktor D2](https://www.recordcase.de/media/image/67/7b/53/Native-Instruments-TRAKTOR-KONTROL-D25a9e86b0786a6_600x600.jpg) the addon controller that makes Traktor work with a closed laptop. No more laptop in front of you. And have a dual-layer deck that controls and displays everything you need in Traktor.

* [Novation Twitch](https://s11234.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Novation-Twitch.jpg) because it was one of the first jogless controllers. It really paved the way for doing things differently. That being jogless controllers which unfortunately never caught on.

* [Numark Orbit](https://www.numark.com/images/sized/images/product_large/Orbit_Ortho_WebLG-624x390.jpg) this strange-looking wireless DJ controller. So you can DJ while on the dance floor yourself. It even controls 4 decks.

* [Numark X2](https://img.audiofanzine.com/images/u/product/normal/numark-x2-49893.jpg) is it a turntable, is it a CD player? It's both. Is it any good at those things? I don't actually know.

* [Pacemaker](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/66/Pacemaker_pocket_dj_system.jpg) well, this thing definitely has its share of fans here in the comments. I can't tell you all that much about it, since I really don't know much about it. But I feel peer pressure to include it.

* [Red Sound InFader](https://live.staticflickr.com/7444/10201929603_92ba25b86f_z.jpg) ""As my sweet mother always said, if one crossfader is good, two crossfader are better, and three crossfaders, well, that's just good business.""

* [Red Sound Soundbite](https://www.djresource.eu/images/gear/redsound-soundbyte-pro.jpg) I don't know if I should include this one. Since the device itself is really good, it's highly sought after, and still worth a lot on the used market. Basically, it's a looper, but one with a really accurate BPM algorithm. Meaning you can record highly accurate vinyl samples on this thing.

* [Stanton SA-5](https://www.djresource.eu/images/gear/stanton-sa-5.jpg) you know how rotary mixers are all the hype? This thing is the reverse of that. It doesn't have a single rotary knob/encoder on it, it's faders all the way down.

* [Stanton SCS.3M](http://www.digitaldjtips.com/app/uploads/2010/11/Stanton-SC-System-3.jpg) because it doesn't really have any physical controls you'd normally expect. Plus it looks incredibly retro space-age.

* [Stanton SCS.4DJ](https://cdn.digitaldjtips.com/app/uploads/2011/08/04022525/Stanton-SCS4DJ1.jpg) because it was a standalone unit almost 10 years before anyone else really got into that. That's pretty incredible.

* [Tascam TT-M1](https://tascam.com/images/products/tt-m1/ttm1-down.jpg) it's a tonearm replacement, like Phase DJ, but long before that ever existed.

* [Tascam X9](https://c1.zzounds.com/media/productmedia/fit,2018by3200/quality,85/x-9-09f53710d13f5bb28f39adb8f2480109.jpg) see those weird high EQs? They are 2 separate adjustable parameters. One is the regular cut/boost, the other is the parametric band EQ.

* [Technics SL-DZ1200](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Technics_SL-DZ1200_Digital_DJ_Turntable.jpg) the thing that would not be. Apparently, on its launch, it was a terrible player. And while things got sorted out later. It was already too late, the CDJ-1000 took the market. And the rest is history. Maybe Technics would've owned the booth with this if it didn't fail spectacularly. I still think it's the most beautiful CD player ever made.

* [Wacom Nextbeat](https://www.synthtopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/nextbeat_undocked.jpg) it's a standalone device, but the device also has a wireless component to it.

* [Zomo MC-1000](https://www.recordcase.de/media/image/cb/28/b7/Zomo-MC-1000-Pro-Mount-Kit-PMK-3-4_600x600.jpg) this is basically a weird addon controller that can basically replace 4 seperate decks.

**Vestax: now there have been companies that experimented with things, some successful, some less so... And there is Vestax.**
These guys were absolutely mental. To this day I think it's the best DJ brand ever. Their Vestax VCI-100 controller basically shaped the way for digital DJing as we know it today. And with brilliance also comes madness. Vestax went bankrupt in 2014. And the DJ gear world got a little worse for it.

* [Vestax AA-88](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CEUZcetWEAA6Alk.jpg:large) a Mini-Disc and CD player/mixer with 4 channels and pitch control.

* [Vestax CDX-16](https://www.audiounion.jp/stock_images/44929.jpg) this thing basically has everything you need in one package. CD players, mixer with crossfader, pitch control, line inputs, phono inputs, mic input.

* [Vestax Controller One](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f9/8a/d1/f98ad1297c187a6f10df0ffe885d2c2f.jpg) arguably the best turntable ever. Far ahead of its time. Only 100 of these decks were made. And they go for obscene prices now on the used market.

* [Vestax Faderboard](http://www.skratchworx.com/images/Vestax/faderboard/faderboard_top.png) this absolutely weird sampler, fader piano thing.

* [Vestax Groove Caster](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/77/ff/f677ffdb8148cbb580900a0b8ac663cc.jpg) a Vestax scratch guitar. Yes, a scratch guitar!

* [Vestax Micro 5](http://www.skratchworx.com/images/micro_5.jpg) as the name implies, it's an incredibly small mixer.

* [Vestax PDT-5000](https://www.djresource.eu/images/gear/vestax-pdt-5000.jpg) II don't know if this would be considered weird, but the analog pitch meter is definitely something I haven't seen on any other turntable.

* [Vestax PDX-01](https://medias.audiofanzine.com/images/normal/vestax-pdx-01-2961655.jpg) it's a round Vestax turntable, because why not?

* [Vestax PMC-005 AMK 3](https://i.imgur.com/xFlEOoe.jpg) it looks like one of those weird top-loading washing machines, but with the plastic body those special editions Nintendo 64 came in. And I simply don't know what to think of it. It just looks weird, and kind of funny. 

* [Vestax PMC-06T](https://smlycdn.akamaized.net/data/product2/2/b974a17428464e8c1c95aace2f6a3866149fbd5a_l.jpg) it's such a weird mixer. I understand the concept of it. But in practice, that really can't be ergonomic. Plus its shape kind of resembles a...

* [Vestax PMC-580](http://www.dj-lab.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/vpcm_2a.jpg) I don't think the world was ready for this mixer just yet. Allen & Heath in 2011 released their Xone:DB4, and that was very well-liked. And people say this mixer has been a huge influence on it. If you put them side by side, it's kind of difficult not to see the similarities.

* [Vestax PVT-e2](https://www.otaiweb.com/player/vestax/pvt_e2_large.jpg) a Vestax turntable that you could pivot. No idea why, but it exists.

* [Vestax QFO](https://www.recordcase.de/media/image/ec/46/60/1135154299-2292158eac388a638e_600x600.jpg) a weird Vestax hybrid turntable/mixer, designed by Qbert.

* [Vestax S-1](https://technabob.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/vestax_s1.jpg) you'd think they would be done with 1 scratch guitar? No. They were not.

* [Vestax STC-V1](https://cdn.djworx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vestax-stc-v1.jpg)in fact they made 3 different scratch guitars.

* [Vestax VCM-600](https://www.recordcase.de/media/image/b2/94/3d/Vestax-VCM-600-DJ-Controller-15a3392ac2ea88.jpg) this MIDI controller is more or less a sort of hybrid studio controller that also works as a DJ controller. I can see this working for live production really well. 

* [Vestax VRX-2000](https://static.turbosquid.com/Preview/2014/05/26__10_25_47/Vestax_VRX_2000_00.jpgb704078b-1611-4032-a7eb-c270a946137eOriginal.jpg) cut your own records at home with this thing.

I might add a few more later on. But I wanted to share some of these curious pieces of DJ gear. If you know any yourself, please comment. I'd love to see more strange DJ gear.

Edit 1: more stuff!

Edit 2: the Vestax crew attended me towards some more madlad stuff.

Edit 3: cleaned the topic up by listing them alphabetically.

Edit 4: added a little more backstory to most of the items.

Edit 5: more have been added.

Edit 6: added 1 more entry, corrected some spelling.

Edit 7: big edit. DJTechTools contacted me. And asked me to write articles for them. And well. I did! Here is the first installment of my Weird DJ Gear series! https://djtechtools.com/2021/06/28/weird-dj-gear-the-underrated-the-odd-and-the-ones-that-made-history/

226,**/r/DJs NEW RULES** Please read before posting,297,dbg3nr,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/dbg3nr/rdjs_new_rules_please_read_before_posting/,99,"New /r/DJs  Rules.


**Top rule - BE NICE.**

* Please try to be polite, friendly and helpful when commenting.
* Trolling, slapfights, general assholery is not encouraged and it also goes without saying that **racist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic posts and language will not be tolerated** at all.

**Moderation policy**

* /r/DJs is not a big sub.  We tend to encourage discussion and engagement first and foremost.  There will be times posts that are seemingly against the sub rules will be left up because the discussion in the comments is informative and engaging.  This is generally more for when a post breaking (certain) rules was missed and the community has already heavily engaged in discussion.  If you see posts breaking the rules, reporting them will help us remove them earlier.
* remember to search - lots of questions tend to be asked multiple times and plenty of answers are given in the archives
* remember that if you are a regular user, newer users are allowed to discuss the same things if it's not overly-frequent.  Just because something was discussed 3 months ago doesn't mean users can't have another conversation about it.


**Please ensure you are posting to the correct subreddit**

 * /r/DJs is generally for more experienced/professional DJ discussion.  There is an entire subreddit dedicated to learning DJing and is filled with experienced DJs willing to spend time helping people out.

**Any and all beginner questions and posts should be made in /r/Beatmatch.**

*Beginner questions include posts that start with:*
 
* “I’m new at this”
* “I want to get into DJing”
* “I just started”
* etc.

*And includes anything basic like:*

* “What controller/headphones/speakers should I buy?” (within reason - someone experienced looking for higher end gear or looking for real world feedback on pro-level stuff is fine).
* “What program should I use?”
* “How do I use this effect?”
* “Is beat matching really important?”
* “Why the hate for sync?”
* etc.

*Any beginner posts here will be deleted.*


**DJ Setup pictures belong in /r/DJsetups.**

* There will be some exceptions - some rare or classic booths or extraordinary setups will stay up, but if you want to post a picture of your DDJ 400 and KRK Rockits, your Technics 1200s and DDJ S9, or a standard CDJ NXS setup that we've all seen, please post to the appropriate sub.

**Meme/Humor/crappy image posts belong in /r/DJsCircleJerk.**

* This includes the low effort, ""djs be like dis” - *stupid picture* - type posts and the like.

**Mixes**

* Most mix posts will be deleted. 
* Short routines, showcasing of interesting technique, and videos that shows off the poster doing something cool is fine. We will also allow high profile posts - say if a regular user gets a feature mix on DJCity or a Serato sponsored set.
* Sets from high profile DJs like boiler room or festivals sets is allowed.
* DJs who want to share mixes can post in /r/mixes or a weekly mix thread that we will be starting soon.

**Gig pictures/Stories**

* We're starting a new weekly sticky every Monday specifically for gig pictures and stories.  We've been seeing a lot more of these posts and while they tend to be heavily upvoted, they also end up just being a picture of some DJ hunched over a setup with a bunch of back-patting in the comments that clutters up the sub.  Any posts of this nature will be deleted and the user will be directed to the weekly Sticky thread.

**The following topics are against sub rules and will be deleted:**

* Self-promotion posts including mixes, tunes, events, companies, competitions, etc.  The one exception we may allow are open deck nights that members of /r/DJs can attend.
* For-sale posts
* Posts discussing music piracy (in the sense of people asking how where or how to pirate music, if you want to have an actual discussion on piracy and how it pertains to the industry, by all means).  Support the people who make your hobby/career possible. 
* Obvious spam for youtube channels/gig logs/blogs/advertisements from members who have no participation in the sub. If people are regular posters on this sub and have a video/service/etc they wish to share, we will allow it initially, although regular spam of it will not be tolerated.
* Posts asking “what should I play for this gig?”  This is a sub for experienced DJs, if you need to ask the internet what to play for a gig, you probably shouldn't have taken the gig.  General music discussion is absolutely fine.
* Spotify playlist posts

Settle in with a Sunday coffee, this is a long one. Apologies for any formatting or spelling errors, I'm on a mobile device. 

I've been a DJ for 20 years, or near enough that it doesn't matter. Over half my life, anyway. I started when I was barely old enough to drive as a mobile guy with gigs at a local youth nightclub, then struggled, scrimped and saved to buy my first pair of turntables (and they weren't even Technics). Over the years I've spent untold thousands on music and even more on equipment, but when I started I was spending every free dime I had buying vinyl singles from one of the first online stores (since no one in my town carried vinyl). I still have a directly-descended copy of the very first song I downloaded off the internet (daft punk - da funk), and got my first club residency (which I subsequently bombed) at 19. New Years Eve 2000 still ranks as the very best show I've ever been a part of. People thought the world was going to end and they partied like it. 

I bought the first generation of CDJ1000's with a loan my mom had to co-sign on. I had a mixshow on a national digital cable station, I've opened for international acts, played live to air on a 100,000 W radio station from the biggest bar in the city; the same bar where I dropped 'The Way You Make Me Feel' at midnight on Saturday the week Michael Jackson died and I have never felt the rush of the crowd like that one moment. I did over 100 mobile gigs in a single year. I've drank my wages and even played for free, and DJ money put me through college with no loans and bought my wife's engagement ring. The gig I did the week after my first daughter was born was one of the most relaxed, smoothest gigs I've ever played. 

I played every Friday and Saturday in 2 bars simultaneously for over 2 years. I've been to more weddings in one summer than most people attend in a lifetime. I'm a feature in the background of thousands of dance floor photos. I have shed blood, sweat, and tears for this life. I've done bar mitzvahs, eaten more turkey dinner at corporate Christmas parties than you can possibly imagine, DJ'ed a wedding that featured a bridal party made up of strippers, and a wedding where I'm relatively sure the couple broke up in front of me. I watched junior high grind lines in the school gym and I've seen seniors all but have sex on the dance floor at aftergrads. 

I've never DJ'ed a festival, though not for lack of trying. I've produced a few remixes and played them out (though they really never should have been), but I've never produced a track of my own. I'm just one of the nameless, faceless DJ's who puts in work every weekend playing music at the bar or your event for 6 hours at a time to make the people dance; the working class of DJ's.

I've DJ'ed sex and swinger parties and even got a little under the booth action at one. My #metoo story happened while I was DJ'ing. My wife saw me play at a nightclub several years before we met and recalls thinking I had a great voice (though she hated my music). I got the worst whiskey dick of my life with a girl I brought home from the bar I was playing at. 

I've gotten black out drunk and held it down, and crashed and burned sober. I've played in front of thousands of people, I've played on massive concert sound systems with full lighting, and I've played to bars with 6 people in them all night on a sound system that was literally held together by duct tape. I've set up and struck gear at all hours of the day - literally; I've been a part of a 3 day setup and once had to strike an entire flown-rig system in under 15 minutes (everything ended up in a heap in the parking lot that we then spent 3 hours packing up properly). I've been gushed over by my clients, I've been told I'm the best, and I've been lambasted as not knowing a damn thing. I've nearly been in a fist fight with a groom because of how rude he was to me with no provocation or prior reason.

I've held the crowd in the palm of my hand, seemingly able to do no wrong, and I've had nights where every track was a struggle. A struggle to pick, a struggle to mix, a struggle to play.

After all of that and so much more, these last ones seem to be more and more common. Last night was like that.

This has been coming down the rails for a long time. Pretty much since another fateful NYE gig that ended on a very sour note. I've just been delaying it. 

I've played 4 gigs so far this year. That's all. Every one of them has been a similar struggle: weeks spent doing music research in advance since with 3 kids and a full time job I don't really keep up anymore. Then I get to the gig and while I keep the dance floor full and get compliments on my set, it's been a long time since I felt like I found a groove, locked into it, and tore the roof off the place properly. I leave feeling like I could do better, every time. I know I would if I played more, but I'm obviously not putting in the effort on many levels. 

I did a wedding earlier this year and the months leading up to it I was stressed. Even though I had made the decision that it would be my last wedding as a DJ. That's another discussion outside of this, but suffice it to say I'm done there. And glad of it. 

Last night, though, I played a gig at a bar I very occasionally fill in at and although I was a little worried expected the usual good time as I've had some VERY successful nights there. But last night ended up being every bit of the struggle I hoped it wouldn't.  

I have one more event booked for NYE this year and nothing after that, and so I think it may be my last official gig. It seems fitting; most of my most memorable and best gigs of my career have been new years eve and the one I have booked for this year is a good client I've done many times and they've always been a great crowd. This one is shaping up to be the same. After that, who knows. It's been a good, long, incredible run, with some of the best (and worst) memories of my life coming from being behind the decks. 

But I think the time has come to stop the turntable, unplug my headphones, center all my EQ knobs, and turn the faders down one last time... and leave them there.

This has been a long read, and I appreciate any and all who have come this far with me. I have one more thing to say, if you'll pardon me soapboxing for one more minute.

To all the DJ's who are just getting started: throw yourselves into this. It's an amazing, beautiful, incredibly fun, and yet painful, dark mistress. Chase the feeling the music gives you. It can give so much to you, but be careful it doesn't take too much in return.

Have fun. Make the people dance. But above all: enjoy it. It's a wild ride.

Thanks for everything. 

Edit: some words. Also a big, heartfelt thank you to all who seem to resonate with this story and to everyone that's commented. I'm feeling the love and you have no idea how much it means to me.",1544381837.0
242,Popular opinion: You hire a DJ. Not a spotify playlist.,287,hmczgx,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/hmczgx/popular_opinion_you_hire_a_dj_not_a_spotify/,116,"I’m often hired for some private party’s. Very often last minute. (Ex.this friday i got a call at 11h30pm for a party 2hrs away that starts at noon the following day). I always ask what type of music they wanna hear because it is a shit show to download songs into serato Mid-set. I always get the same answer “we like everything”. So I prepare a “everything” set (house,techno,rap,bass house,trap,pop,rock...etc). Then a few hours(minutes) into the set , you get people that want that and that song (or worse, they want you to play a song you already played). Then , when you get out a bit of some people comfort zones (that is especially a problem with rap lovers) they come and tell you you know nothing about good music and shit...meanwhile if they looked around them they would see all those booty cheeks dancing on the floor because I chose to play tropical house instead of Sicko mode for the 3rd time.

I guess what i’m trying to say is : if you hire a plumber , you wont come and try to tell him how to repair a leak. Well if you hire a DJ, that is YOU giving control of the music at your party to somebody else. I won’t say no to a few request , but if you’re in my face with your phone open on your fave beat every 5 min i’m gonna hate you for ever.",1594059484.0

They think they need to know everything about effects, the EQ and the filters. They gotta have a gobs of transition ideas and master the loops.

What most of todays DJ's don't realize, is that back in the day when we spun vinyl, all we had was a crossfader.

One crossfader.

And you know what?

We killed it with that crossfader.

We killed it with the music.

Todays decks and mixers offer a huge variety of tools to help DJ's make things interesting. But all those tools isn't what makes a set.

It's playing dope ass tracks and playing them at the right time.

It's understanding the flow of energy. Things start out calm and cool. Then the energy increases until the roof is on fire. The vibe goes down, up, down, up and down until your done. You end the set with a milestone to make sure everyone remembers you.

Believe me when I tell you, that the music is where it's at. Give more attention to what you play and when you play it. The music will take care of everything.",1596259099.0

The price is ridiculous for what it does. They copied what Denon GO did three years ago but slapped their label on it and made it way more expensive. The only benefits are portability, ease of setting up, and “aesthetic.” The controls look terrible, sliders are so small, and it’s missing some key features for professional performance. The battery only lasts 5 hours. It’s not truly “wireless” you have to RCA into a chunky AlphaTheta receiver (which they list nothing about in the website, I literally can’t tell anywhere if it’s included with the product)  The USB input on the back hurts my soul, and don’t get me started on the “Bluetooth audio input enables the crowd to join” lmao 

The problem is, no one taking DJing seriously would invest in this. This is not for clubs, promoters, or anyone in industry. And no one casually DJing would pay that much for a toy like this… unless they had disposable income. Nobody asked for this. If they wanted the rebrand to be taken seriously, they should’ve come out with a more serious product. 

You’re gonna see content creators doing short form videos playing Losing It at the Eiffel Tower or Badadan in a fucking bodega on this thing. 

And don’t get me started on the speaker -_-

Anyway feel free to join my hate train lol, or even offer up some counter opinions. I’m interested and concerned to see what happens to this brand.",1706196316.0

I didn't record a lot of my mixes, i only have about 20 or so still recorded sadly. I never had a mad desire to be famous, just loved doing it. I did about half on vinyl before i switched to ableton (mid 00s). The ableton ones are better, no question - pristine mixing on some of my favourite tunes. I haven't listened for a while, but i did a recap during lockdown. But here was my surprise. It was the worst mixes on the vinyl that have all the memories. I remember where i was, who was with me, the bad mixes i made (and recorded) sometimes off the cuff with no pre-planning. It's strange, but very nostalgic.

I'm not saying that you should share this stuff online if you want to get followers, gain support. But if you're messing around with friends, record that stuff and keep it. You will thank yourself, i promise

My first gig was a wedding. My dad was there and he said this is your gig I'm just there to help you out if needed.

I practiced my ass off at home, desperately wanting to impress my dad and the audience. 

I started playing, mixing and scratching like a maniac. After 15 minutes my dad tapped my on my shoulder and whispered in my ear:

Press que and start counting.

But.. but.. I'm mixing

Just do it, trust me

So I presses the que button and started counting, he counted with me. After 43 seconds one guy in the front said

""Hey, where'd the music go""

My dad grabbed the mic and introduced us, congratulated the married couple and said it could get pretty lonely behind the booth. So please come and join us and bring your requests. And made a joke that requests aren't free but cost one sparkling water.

They loved it.

He told me to Press play and let the songs play out, mix the last couple of beats or do an echo out.
We had a blast, So did the guess. Within 40 minutes we had a full page of requests and 4 sparkling water.

I never forgot what he said

Be a good Host
Make yourself approuchable 
Let them pick the music
Let the songs play out
Talk to people
Walk the room

Ever since we did gigs together, he had a heart attack recently. Alive and stubborn but not able to do gigs.

Every gig After 15 minutes I Press que, wait till they notice the silence and introduce myself. And on Nights when drinks are free I make the joke about the sparkling water.

Its not about mixing or gear it's about the way you carry yourself.

Lately I've teamed up with some like-minded people and our latest outdoor party went much better than expected. As usual, we've invited our friends, they invited their friends, and as a result we've ended up having a full-fledged rave in a forest with 8 DJs and 200+ party people!

People loved our event and the concept so much, that since then we are bombarded with contacts. The number of people who would like to come is growing every day, so far we are more than 600 in the ""guest list"" and most of them will come with plus people. We went so viral that some people wish to come even from other cities that are 2+ hours away...

We are potentially are looking at about 700-1000 people at our next event. Well... That's going to be literally a shitshow because at the first event we didn't have any toilets, no security, nothing, as it meant to be a small forest party/rave with friends. Even if we asked everyone to don't throw garbage away and to clean up after themselves, we had to collect a ton of garbage at the end.

Since we can't handle that 700-1000 people ourselves, we have to get professionals involved, in terms of toilets, security and cleaning up.

So here I am for advice.
Someone with experience in organising events, please tell me:
- How many portable toilets do you need per 100 people?
- How many security personnel is needed per 100 people?
- How many cleaning personnel needed to clean up after 100 people?

Also, any other advice is very welcome 🤗",1700720570.0

315,How I became a better DJ over time.,258,ycsvfi,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ycsvfi/how_i_became_a_better_dj_over_time/,32,"Hey r/Djs 

Bit of a long post ahead. But I am taking this time to write for all those who are starting off, or veterans who would like to chime in.

Like many people here, I started off with a basic 2 channel pioneer controller. I dont have any sort of musical background, so it took a lot of trail and error, but my first way of learning was lining up waveforms to beat match. After practicing on and off for about a year I started to upgrade my bedroom setup to equipment you would have in a club as I felt I needed to be more comfortable. So I skipped the cdjs and went vinyl (later bought 2 xdj700s). 

I began collecting and practicing djing on vinyl for a few years before I fundamentally ""mastered"" beat matching by ear, riding the pitch and so on. But the important part was learning to listen and training my ears. 

As mentioned, I never had any sort of musical background so beats/bars/phrases are all new to me, I was mixing in records where I felt a phrase was long enough for the new record to come in seemingly. It wasnt until I started watching ellaskins and other vinyl djing tutorials to understand what phrase mixing was. 

This is where my real improvement came in. Its one thing to have 2 tracks in beat/time, but its another thing to have them mixed in phrase. Even the simplest transition, or mashing up 2 records, putting them in at the same phrase timing (depending on the records) can really create interesting sounds. I started to experiment with this a lot more, recording mixes for my own personal growth, and putting out other mixes for a ""series/playlist"" on my soundcloud. This is where you can really understand how much you improve by listening to old mixes compared to new ones. 

Having the time to experiment, listen and improve on my mixing has really improved my skills as a DJ. These are actually quite simple, and this might be pretty easy for most, but as said before I had no musical background nor anyone teaching me. I dont even have any use for looping intros as I pickup phrases and cue in. 

After approx 5 years of djing, I'd like to say I am quite confident that I am ""skillful"" (and I use that word lightly as most of the points I mention are quite basic), but I'm always looking for ways to improve. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Below are summarized points of above, plus extra points on things ive learned while gigging. I know this may be pretty straight forward to most, but nobody has guided me to help me learn what I know today so I hope this helps someone:

1. Always practice. 
2. Learn your music
3. Learn to listen
4. Learn how to beat match by ear
5. Learn how to phrase mix 
6. Record your mixes, learn why it sucks/sounds good and go from there
7. Support the artists and buy their records/tracks however possible. 
8. Music selection is the most important factor in a set. Id say 70%. 30% is mixing. 
9. Keep yourself updated with new/old record labels to dig into. There is so much great music out there if you look hard enough. 
10. Club standard gear doesn't necessarily make you a better DJ (the above points makes you a better DJ). Just helps you be more prepared for the inevitable when youre faced with foreign gear.
11. Most of the booth monitors in clubs/bars suck. Rely on your own headphones for monitoring, but you should not be locked in too much in your headphones as you need to hear whats happening on the PA from time to time (could accidentally have HPF/LPF activated without you knowing etc).
12. Warming up the room is an important skill. Learn to build your collection of music and to organize it for your gig.
13. Know your place in a time slot. Don't bangout and tire out people before peak hours/headliner plays. This goes hand in hand with volume control (I've seen promoters/sound techs gossip/argue about opening djs who ruin the night because of this).
14. Be professional, show up early if you can. Stay late if you can. Dont be that person who takes a timeslot and leaves right after to goto another party. Most times than not, the party is made up of friends in the industry who all work together one way or another, and it doesnt look good to just leave right after your set (unless you actually have to, or youre an international DJ who needs to leave right away to catch the next flight). 
15. More on #14, dont show up trashed. Take any gig small/big as a blessing of an opportunity. Humble and remind yourself why you started this venture in the first place. If you require alcohol/drugs to ""perform"" due to social stresses/anxiety, then you should seek therapy to help overcome these rather than substances. 
16. Do your research on people youre on the lineup/bill with. It doesnt hurt to know more about them. 
17. Go out to other peoples events. Get to know people. Join local collectives/groups. Do your best to be a part of the community. Supporting others will usually follow with support for you. 
18. Mistakes happen. How you fix the mistake really measures how skillful you are. In my opinion, hearing tracks go slightly off beat then, back on beat are always great. Even better when the needle skips mid mix. Reminds people youre actually doing something. 
19. DJing for a crowd of 15 people is a lot harder than djing for 100+ people.
20. Learn to find inspiration from other djs/artists. But dont bite their routines/styles and pawn it off as your own.

316,The DJ does not need a crowd...,257,lj5zza,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/lj5zza/the_dj_does_not_need_a_crowd/,48,"I'm posting this to give voice to an aspect of DJing I think is under represented here. My background is that I've been DJing since the early 90s. This is through college, early career, marriage, 2 kids, etc... I am first and foremost an active music lover. DJing is one facet of that lifelong love.

My argument is that it's equally valid to DJ for yourself or for the art of DJing as it is to be crowd- or event- focused. And when you start your musical journey, there shouldn't *necessarily* be an expectation that you'll DJ in front of people.

This stems from my belief that DJing is primarily a musical endeavor. We start playing instruments as children. And those of us who keep playing enjoy the physical act of playing, the self-improvement, and the output of making music. As young musicians progress, they give recitals (because it's a requirement), and they may join the school band. A social aspect begins to form, but very few youngsters are focused on the performer/audience/performance relationship. The motivation is mostly due to enjoying the act of making the music. This continues (or starts) into adulthood, as people play for themselves: most do not give performances. To me, DJing is similar...

Earlier in my life I had the opportunity to DJ in public. I've DJed clubs, raves, house parties, festivals, art openings, but never once did I pursue the gig. I was a very online person, and promoters must have liked my enthusiastic posts (in addition to mixes that I enjoyed sharing). And that mix-sharing came from the motivation that every music fan has; sharing what they love.
  
Later in my life, I lost all touch with any kind of music scene. And that's fine, but loving music remains as bedrock of my identity. Being a ""DJ Musician"" is part of that. And so I'm on Spotify for 10s of thousands of minutes a year, and I buy hundreds of dance-focused tracks a year, and spend my weekends making mixes, organizing music, and researching music - 100% for me. 

So here's the view that I want people to take away: DJing is fundamentally a creative musical endeavor; it is quite similar to playing an instrument. The majority of people who play instruments are not focused on the performance aspect. DJing can following exactly in that mold.

(n.b., nothing above was written to contradict others, but bring balance: the music-focused and performance/crowd focused concepts of a DJ can coexist. We are friends, we learn from each other, we criticize one another, and we enjoy the other's mixes.)",1613240649.0

I saw on a DJ group on Facebook that there were people discussing DJ setups, and that the guy posting it said he was lucky his wife let him put his gear down.

And I just want to put down my thoughts on this. I find it odd this sort of thing is seemingly normalized. In essence, you are telling your partner who has a hobby that sparks joy for them, that the items required for it are a bother. And in some cases ""has to be sold"". I just want to dig into the fact that one person is pressuring a loved one into giving up an activity that they enjoy. And how incredibly messed up that is. Don't take away enjoyable things from people you care about. That makes you a very toxic person. And I don't want to turn this into women versus men thing... But if a man would tell a woman to get rid of her hobby items that wouldn't fly one bit. Neither should the reverse. Let people enjoy things.

So idk what I was expecting with djing (finally took the plunge and dropped money on an xdj-rx2 so i can play shows😃)but WOW this so much harder than i imagined.

I grew up playing music, and I was that asshole who could pick up and play most instruments really well without much practice.

Goddamn it is NOT the case with DJing. Sure, beatmatching isn’t too hard, using the cue, crossfading, “cross fading” with the EQ… Whatever. Performing all these little actions isn’t too hard imo.

What I feel like is really under-appreciated is simply knowing WHEN to end a track, start a new track, knowing if those two tracks even sound good together (this takes sooo long), and of course at what points do they sound good together. Beatmatching isn’t hard on it’s own, but when you take everything else into account and sometimes you’ve got like a 10 second time window…holy shit it’s overwhelming

Add in the skill of trying to read what people want to hear in the moment, and hoping you know how to mesh whatever song is coming next to the mix in a cool way???

She's a big house/techno/tech house fan and asked me to DJ since that's basically what I spin. I asked her for a spotify playlist so I could download the music she wanted and that was that. I get to the party, start setting up my gear (XDJ's and 900nxs2 mixer) and a fellow DJ comes over and is like 'woah I didn't know you DJ'd, that's sick man, so do I! I do mainly hip hop though'. In my head I'm like 'I know exactly how this evening will pan out. I'm going to setup, gunna start DJing and he's gunna ask if he can spin'.....and that's exactly what went on. I got it all setup, turned on the music and he was awkwardly standing there. He was more of a bedroom DJ and has never spun on a classic pioneer setup so I was nice enough to let him spin a bit to give him experience on some newer gear.   


He wasn't the best but he seemed to be having fun and I was walking him through the different effects and what not. It was fun for the first 20 min but then he's like 'you got any hip hop?' and I was like nah, I was told to just download the playlist (I'm not a fan of hip hop and have none on my computer). he's like 'ah shit, I can run to my house quick that's like 20 min away and bring my controller and laptop to hook up. I was like '.....bro don't worry, just DJ the next party'. He's like alright cool cool......'.   


He then wouldn't really move from the tables, keep spinning and was train wrecking hard, which is fine, he's new to the gear, I get it but like I'm trying to play some chunes and have a good time, not worry about people bothering me. He asks me again, 'bro I don't live too far, I can grab my stuff.' I was like 'if you want, go for it'. At this point I was annoyed and didn't feel like DJing anymore because it was killing the vibe a bit. I was expecting him to come back, he can spin on his controller and I can fuck off to the party and get drunk lol and not worry about it. A funny thing happened next...  


He leaves, and in the meantime, another guest came who was also a tech house/house/techno DJ and he came over to chat and be super cool about it. He's like 'I got my USB, mind if I plug in and we'll do a b2b with 2 songs each?' (THIS IS HOW YOU APPROACH IT). I said fuck ya, so we b2b for like 30 min, and it was fun, people were enjoying the tunes and I then say to take over because I wanna go play beer games and stuff. He takes over, seems to be having a fun time and then the hip-hop guy comes back with his computer, controller and hard drive. He comes up to me and is like 'so can I plug in?' and I'm like 'idk, ask buddy who's DJing'. He goes over and the guy didn't really wanna say no but he's like 'the vibe is good, just let it be'. Hip-hop guy came back to me and I'm like 'bro, idk what else you want from me, just DJ the next party'. 

He ended up letting it go and he left not too long after that. 

Guys, please. Do not do this. We get it, you DJ, your grandma DJ's, so does your dog. If you see a DJ at a house party, you can chat them up but please don't be hip-hop guy. It's annoying as fuck and wastes peoples time. Enjoy the party and then just DJ the next one.

340,The one thing they don't tell you about being a professional DJ...,243,1ba48cj,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1ba48cj/the_one_thing_they_dont_tell_you_about_being_a/,43,"In my 10 years as a touring DJ, I've noticed the importance of good mental health is always overlooked, especially by aspiring DJs trying to make their dreams a reality.

Professional DJing is not a career for the mentally weak. Every touring artist, across all genres of music and art forms, will at some point struggle with their mental health. It's the nature of the job. The combination of easy access to substances, long and late hours, irregular sleep schedules, pressure to sell tickets, social media presence/comparisons, and the need to constantly produce great art for fans, all while paying the bills, will create a ticking time bomb that will explode if not managed meticulously. I battle with this balancing act regularly, so I wanted to provide my top tips for all of you out there:

1. Self-care Is Non-Negotiable: You will burn out if you can't care for yourself. Whether meditation, exercise, healthy eating, or simply taking time for yourself, ensure you're nurturing your physical and emotional well-being amidst the hectic touring schedule.

2. Establish Boundaries: The word ""No"" is your friend and essential in carving out moments for rest. This could mean turning down a gig or the third afterparty of the weekend.

3. Stay Connected: Touring is isolating, so stay connected with loved ones and fellow DJs. Maintain relationships the best you can. Surrounding yourself with a supportive network can provide much-needed comfort and encouragement.

4. Practice Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness practices into your daily routine. Whether meditation, breathing exercises, or appreciating your surroundings, mindfulness can help reduce stress amidst the chaos of touring.

5. Seek Professional Support: Don't hesitate to seek professional support if you struggle. Touring can take a toll on mental well-being, and having a therapist or counselor to talk to goes a long way. Many therapists offer virtual sessions, making it easier to access support while on the road.

6. Stay Balanced: Take breaks from the nightlife scene when possible, engage in activities that bring you joy outside of DJing, and remember to prioritize your overall well-being above all else. Sometimes partying all night is exactly what you need to blow off steam. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY!

Don't get me wrong, I love being able to DJ for a living. It was my dream, and it still is. I just thought I'd shine a light on the other side of the industry that isn't talked about as much.  ",1709944321.0

Here’s the thing, bride’s family is all coming into town, so it’s shifted to a “party”. I’ve heard from the planner that the bride is devastated and not the mood or mindset to make decisions about music, which I respect and understand. Has anyone ever dealt with this scenario? How’d you navigate? Thanks in advance and wish me luck lol the playlist


Edit - this garnered a lot more attention than I expected so thank you all for your input, both the intelligent and the not so intelligent. However, I do wanna address a couple of things.

1. This is not a panic post. I’m not asking “what should I do?” After re-reading the post I can see how you may have thought that however, the intention of this post was more of a “share your story” type of thing. I’m not terrified of the gig.  I am confident enough in both my Dj & social skills that this will not be a “nightmare“ set. 

2. I mentioned in the comments that I had the bride review the playlist, and I think some of you took this as me asking her to choose the music for her event. If you were one of these people, you are wrong. I simply wanted to make sure that I do not play a song that she does not want to hear, which I believe is completely reasonable in this scenario. 

3. Some of you suggested that I just refund and cancel the event. I’m not sure if you understand how weddings or events for that purpose work. There are a lot of elements to weddings.. venue, vendors, entertainment, family etc. I’ve had talks with both the bride and the planner. I’ve even offered to waive my cancellation clause for this particular case and the bride wishes to continue with the party, so why would I cancel on her? Her groom already left her hanging and you’re suggesting that DJ follow suit? I question some of y’all’s professionalism. It sounds like you’re afraid of a challenge. The worst case scenario for me is that I learn enough how to play this gig next time, should this scenario ever arise again.

Thank you to those who provided usable advice and thank you to all of the lil trolls under the bridge. I’ll make an updated post after the event and let you all know how it goes.",1692631177.0

Just discovered this sub.,233,ueqrxn,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ueqrxn/former_event_dj_here_1000_gigs_over_20_years_just/,81,"Having a great time hearing people talk about gigs and pay and setup and tear-down and dealing with clients etc. It really takes me back. 

When I first started as a 16 year old in 1998, us Event DJs were still using Tape Decks. We didn’t use Vinyl because the music library was physically too large vs tapes. We use to remove the covers of the tape decks, to leave the tape exposed, because some of the players had terrible fast-forward (FF) track searching and it would often Cue a couple of beats/seconds into the song, so we kept the covers off so we could stick our fingers in the reel of the tape and manually wind-it-back a few millimeters, for a better Cue point. 

When compact disc (CD) players came out it was a exciting. But we didn’t have “anti-skip” right away. These old ‘DJ console’ (usually a road case with the double CD player on top and a mixer below, mounted to a shelf, that you would pull out), we’re so sensitive that if anyone bumped the table, the CD would skip. Think about that, you know how busy the dj booth gets at parties, imagine the entire party stopping everytime someone bumped the table when requesting a song etc. To prevent this, we had big sponges we would put under the DJ consoles that would literally sway the box when it got bumped, and they looked so ridiculously terrible. 

I used to carrry around a 70lbs box with hundreds of cds. We had to remember which CD compilation had which songs and if we forgot we had to literally look it up in a catalogue. Playlisting usually meant flipping CDs diagonally in their carrying case for quick access. When at-home CD burning technology became affordable, this helped tremendously, we could make our own CD playlists.

Anti-skip was a big deal. CD burning was a big deal. Imagine when Serato came out. It was paradigm shifting. No more heavy cd cases or big boxed DJ consoles, I could DJ with a laptop and a mixer and search my music library in seconds. I still can’t believe it. 

Picking it back up for fun, I’m further astonished at how far we’ve come. I recently bought the Numark Mixstream Pro. It’s a standalone controller. I can put music on a usb drive or use Tidal/Dropbox. I don’t even need a laptop. It also had a built in DMX lighting controller. All for about $600usd. I am literally mindblown.

Now anyone can be a DJ with very little investment. And I think that is a awesome. Things only get better when more people have access to it. I can’t wait to see where YOU all take this in the next 20 years!

369,"There is no meaningful, discernible difference between 320kbps MP3s and lossless audio",237,sp5981,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/sp5981/there_is_no_meaningful_discernible_difference/,197,"Reposting a comment I made in another thread to make this clear, since it comes up again and again. 

Study after study have shown that only a tiny minority of highly experienced people listening in a studio setting with high quality audio equipment can tell the difference between uncompressed audio and high bitrate MP3s. 

Here’s an easily accessible study, with the findings highlighted below. 

https://www.academia.edu/441306/Subjective_Evaluation_of_MP3_Compression_for_Different_Musical_Genres

>	Over all musical excerpts, listeners significantly preferred (p<0.05) CD quality files to mp3 files for bitrates ranging from 96 to 192 kbits/s.

>	The results are not significant between CD quality files and mp3 files for higher bitrates (256 and 320 kbits/s). Regarding comparisons amongst mp3 files with different levels of compression, listeners always significantly preferred the higher quality version, except for the comparison  between 320 and 256 kbits/s where the results did not reach statistical significance.

>	Specifically, we observed that trained listeners can discriminate and significantly prefer CD quality over mp3 compressed files for bitrates ranging from 96 to 192 kbits/s.

>	Regarding higher bitrates (256 and 320 kbits/s), they could not discriminate CD quality over mp3 while expert listeners, with more years of studio experience, could in the same listening conditions in Sutherland’s study [8].

>	Differences between young sound engineers and experts can be attributed to improved critical listening skills based on individual listening experiences. Furthermore, sound engineers and musicians may not focus on the same sound criteria when listening to music.

In other words, your audience doesn’t know, can’t tell, or even care if you’re playing 320’s vs wavs. 

Highly trained DJs and producers, on very well tuned systems in a properly set up club might. But even then, in the real world, 99.999% of all gigging environments and audiences will not be able to tell - *even on a big system*. 

Yes, playing anything less than 320 is more easily discernible, even for the average customer. Playing YouTube tips is totally obvious. In same cases as well, under extreme pitch bending circumstances, the difference may be clear. But for all practical purposes, 320 kbps MP3’s sound identical to uncompressed formats.

*************

**UPDATE:**

I sourced a few more studies that address some of the points raised in the comments. All evidence points to the fact that *in both real world and controlled environments, the difference is effectively imperceptible*. 

1.	A larger study with a sample size of N=100. Same results: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijdmb/2019/8265301/
2.	A study comparing different listening equipment. Same result: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301428302_Perceived_Audio_Quality_for_Streaming_Stereo_Music
3.	Another study with a similar sample size. Same results: https://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=19397
4.	A study showing how playing MP3’s on a sound system removes the ability to hear artefacts (due to reverb, room acoustics and cross talk): https://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=12896
5.	A study which shows that MP3 can produce slightly different emotional impressions but that reverb (room sounds) eliminates this effect: https://repository.ust.hk/ir/Record/1783.1-105601

You can ignore these and everyone’s personal preference is their own. But all the evidence I can find - in all the studies I have access to - indicate that there is effectively no perceptible difference in almost all cases (particularly in real world settings). 

Doesn’t matter if you’re playing in your AirPods or on a Funktion One, the audience can’t tell and doesn’t care (in 99.99% of cases in the real world).

Everything else matters a lot more; including DAC quality, mixer quality, amp quality, amp settings, processing, speaker quality, speaker placement, speaker calibration, room size, room shape, room treatment, crowd size and crowd noise. 

So don’t stress, buy the format you like, and never play YouRube rips. Ever.

> it might sound basic, but i still think that one of the best things you can do if you're learning to DJ is to cover up the BPM readers and learn to mix by ear. there are a few reasons for this, and none of them are about authenticity or elitism, or what equipment you've decided to start using
> 
> most newer DJing technology has been designed to streamline the experience of playing music, but technology will always let you down occasionally, whether it's down to a flaw in the tech itself or errors you've made in preparation to use that tech. if you're too reliant on it working perfectly, then you won't be able to correct errors by ear when they do happen. if you can learn to mix by ear, you'll end up with a more intuitive understanding of why a blend might be working, or why it might not be despite the BPMs matching
> 
> two tracks can be mathematically in time with each other, but can sound like carnage if the rhythmic emphasis across those tracks is very different. if you've learnt to mix by ear you'll eventually be better equipped to think about what songs will fit together effortlessly and which will require a heavier handed approach in the mix. or, if you've decided that car crashes and heavy clangs are key to your aesthetic, you'll be able to implement them with intention! :)
> 
> if you can mix by ear, you also don't have to do as much tedious laptop admin preparing your set. you don't need to sit in rekordbox or serato for as long. you'll be able to trust yourself to improvise and you'll feel more relaxed in the club itself as a result 
> 
> it's hard to articulate this kind of thing without sounding like a hippie, and this is mostly just a personal observation - but a big part of what's kept me engaged with this for so many years is that when im really enjoying a set, i can get into some kind of flow state through playing the music. when i can get to that state, i feel at one with the ~~vibezzz~. it's effortless and it feels like i'm inside the music. but if i'm overwhelmingly focused on the functionality of the CDJs and on stuff ive prepped in rekordbox, it's harder to get to that place, and it can feel more like just another numbing screen-based activity - and crucially, that makes the end result *sound different*",1589299747.0

Like many of you, I fell in love with it and never looked back. Early on I was all about playing clubs, I’d play almost every weekend in my early 20’s and earn anywhere from $150-$350 a night. I thought this was great money, working until 2 am, all my friends right there with me. Then, I found weddings. More specifically a multi-op company that does over 400 weddings a year. I sent them an email, got the ball rolling and I’ve been with them for 6 years now. I don’t have to do any booking, any contract questions, any self promotion…they fill my schedule and I get the job done. I do about 35 weddings a year ON ONLY SATURDAYS. They pay me $1000+ per wedding along with a 4% 401k match. DJing went from something that I make some grocery money with to almost a full secondary salary just working 32 out of 52 Saturday’s. One of the best parts is I’m usually home and on the couch by 10:30pm. I’m only posting this because I never thought in my wildest dreams I’d be making this kind of extra money DJing. My 401k with the company is already saved up to over 50k, all just spinning records. If you have any interest in teaming up with a local op, odds are you can find one by searching “wedding dj” in your area and follow the bread crumbs. You can make a legitimate living DJing no doubt.

It is important, and I can't stress this enough, to backup AND to purchase your music. 

Since the early 2000s I have been collecting music 
mp3/wav files. Occasionally a hard drive would fail, or I would forget a password to a streaming service account, etc. 

I would search and search, but never find some songs again. Small bootlegs or remixes, songs that didn't properly clear licensing, can just dissapear forever. 

If I did find some of them, they may be at crappy lowfi quality, through some pirate source, not worth playing for a crowd of 500 people. Some artists have no information about them available, so you can't track them down.

And eventually you forget about them, and those hidden gems are gone forever. 

If you rely on streaming alone, this will happen to you. There are plenty of songs that get removed from all streaming sources, a year or two later, due to licensing problems.

Streaming service are great, I use Tidal often when I am playing an open format gig, and someone's grandma wants to hear the Platters.

But Streaming services are very controlled by the industry and a lot of great songs are removed due to legal issues.

Download, purchase, store, back up, and save your music.

Most older DJs have their white whale track that they can never find, or is only available now on vinyl for $500,  but rarely comes up available.

It is our job not just to entertain but often to do so with unique or special music, and we have all seen music dissapear from the Internet. We have to rely on a strong library, not just streaming services.",1675440011.0

Often, it's what we crave the most that destroys us. A deep dive into the underbelly of artistic and creative success.

>***I’ve loved attention my whole life…but I don’t think anyone knows what fame actually is. Because if I did want to be famous—it wasn’t this kind.***  
>  
>**Billie Eilish**

# The pursuit of fame

Artists and creatives want to be renowned for their work. We are driven by our passions and our purpose.

Artists and creatives are insecure. There’s a spectrum — a continuum. I’m on it. You’re on it — we all are. 

The questions we ask ourselves are: **Am I good enough? Or if we’ve tasted success before: Am I** ***still*** **good enough?**

Many successful artists are insecure overachievers. They are driven by their insecurities. They’re highly competitive people who never feel good enough, which drives them to work even harder in their quest for approval. 

>***I had enormous self-image problems and very low self-esteem, which I hid behind obsessive writing and performing. …. I really felt so utterly inadequate. I thought the work was the only thing of value.***   
>  
>**David Bowie**

In his book, Orville Gilbert Brim, the social psychologist and author of *Look at Me! The Fame Motive from Childhood to Death* stated that modern culture was full of people who want to be famous so they can feel accepted. He talks in depth about the basic human need for approval.

The British Psychological Society did extensive studies into the seemingly universal desire for fame.

They list various reasons such as narcissism, altruism but mostly their studies showed participants wanted to use fame to overcome insecurities and low self-esteem. 

**We all seek external validation.** 

 And why wouldn’t we? We have grown up being praised and rewarded when we pleased our parents and teachers and scorned when we did not. 

**We want to seen. We want to be relevant.** 

In a sea of billions, we want our voices to be heard above the crashing waves of mediocrity. 

**We want to feel good enough.** 

#  The sweet seduction of success

The first taste of success is incredibly intoxicating. Artists and producers who have struggled for years and years are suddenly thrust into the spotlight. 

Songs that were previously ignored fill nationwide radio playlists and global Spotify charts, getting millions of streams a day. 

Artist’s are invited to perform on the biggest TV talk shows, they sell out huge venues and everybody gushes about them on social media.

They are new and shiny and the public is smitten. It is the ultimate validation for any artist. But it doesn’t last.

**You see, most artists believe that creative success will fix them. That it will fill the voids in their self-esteem.**

That a new found confidence will course through their bodies and fill the emptiness they feel inside. They think success will make them happy. 

**They are wrong.** 

Fame will 10 X your insecurities and fears. 

>***If I’ve learned anything, it is this: fame will not fix your problems.***    
>  
>***Instead, fame is likely to magnify all of your insecurities and exaggerate all of your fears. It’s like picking up a fire extinguisher for your pain that ends up being a canister of gasoline***  
>  
>**Tim Ferris**

# The happiness paradox

**The basic premise of society is if you work hard you will be successful and then you will be happy. It is the American dream.**

This is what society has told you, this is what pop culture has sold you, this is what your parents have implored upon you.

But that is broken and backwards.

Every time you experience success you change the goal to an even bigger one and thus never reach it. 

**It’s a hedonic treadmill**

&#x200B;

* You get 5 million streams, you want 10 million streams   
 
* You make a million dollars, you want $2 million dollars.   
 
* You have a number 1 hit, you immediately want another one.   
 

>***Happiness is an emotional response to an outcome. If I win I will be happy, if I don’t — I won’t. It’s a if then, cause and effect, quid pro quo standard that we can’t sustain. Because we immediately raise it every time we attain it.***   
>  
>**Matthew McConaughy**

The more we chase happiness through success and the applause of strangers, the further away we get from it. 

**Happiness is not a destination.** 

The harsh truth is, after working towards a goal we were convinced would make us happy for years, sometimes decades, only to realise it’s all been an illusion is a depressing realisation. 

>***I had bought into the not uncommon notion that when I tasted success when I get over there I’ll be happy. But the strangest thing happened, as the show got more successful — I got more depressed.***  
>  
>**Josh Radner**

Researchers call it the expectation gap. The difference between our perception of success being greater than the reality of success

**Expectation gap = expectations > reality.**

The pressures to perform are overwhelmingly intense. The more successful we become, the more we feel we’re not good enough.

>***The more successful I get, the more insecurities I'm getting, it's weird. I don't know if it's because I'm so blown away that people like what I do, but I just feel like I'm never going to live up to it.'***   
>  
>***‘I have anxiety attacks, constant panicking on stage, my heart feels like it's going to explode because I never feel like I'm going to deliver, ever.’***  
>  
>**Adele**

Successful artists and producers feel they have to be perfect. Their whole identity and self-esteem are built on the approval of people they don’t know. They read everything that is written about them and every comment. 

They ignore all the positive comments and obsess over the tiny fraction of nasty, hurtful and spiteful remarks that cut to the very bone. 

>***Every DJ, no matter how big or how small, deals with a certain amount of insecurities. The pressure can be huge. Every artist is a perfectionist.***  
>  
>***We all read everything that is being said about us. That is the truth.***  
>  
>**Armin Van Buuren**

It’s a vacuous job. Artists’ are always approving photographs and videos of themselves. 

They are being judged on how they look and how they act.

They constantly feel the need to be perfect. For their work to be culture defining. The pressures to constantly outperform every time are crippling. 

>***There’s so much pressure putting new music out. If I don’t beat everything I’ve done prior it will be deemed as a colossal failure***  
>  
>**Taylor Swift**

**Perfection is an illusion.**

It’s an unachievable and impossible goal that only serves to create deeper feelings of imposter syndrome.

And their self-esteem becomes more and more reliant on the applause of strangers as a result. 

>***We’re people that got into this life because we want people to like us. We’re intrinsically insecure because we like the sound of people clapping because it makes us forget how much we don’t feel good enough. I’ve been doing this for 15 years and I’m tired.***  
>  
>**Taylor Swift**

**Success does not make you happy. Happiness makes you successful**

# It’s a human thing

After two decades of working closely with famous, successful artists the truth is  – for most of us, anyway – we are just not emotionally designed to be famous. 

**We are too insecure.**

We care too much what others think. We can’t handle the overwhelming pressure of living up to unrealistic expectations. 

This is why there’s so much substance abuse, depression and mental health issues with artists and creative at all levels. 

We get swept up in external validation. When our self-esteem relies on the public and the industries approval we lose our identity. 

>***Sometimes I don't feel as if I'm a person at all. I'm just a collection of other people's ideas.”***   
>  
>**David Bowie**

**The irony of success is, you may be loved millions who worship you for the person they** ***think*** **you are.** 

**Yet you spend every night alone wishing just one person loved you for who you** ***really*** **are.** 

Success will lead you to question your faith in humanity. 

You will become paranoid. You think everybody has an ulterior motive. 

You will be suspicious of the motives of people that are less successful than you. 

As people who are more successful will be suspicious of you. 

And your world gets smaller and smaller. 

>***It’s amazing how lonely you can become***   
>  
>**Rihanna**

Most artists and creatives are driven to succeed so they can be liked and accepted. Yet they end up isolating themselves out of fear and anxiety. They are lonely. It’s tragically ironic. 

Ed Sheeran pays four old school friends to go on tour with him. 

He doesn’t trust anyone else and doesn’t want to be alone, while he plays to hundreds of thousands of adoring fans who pay a small fortune to see him on tour.

# The moral of the story

>***I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it’s not the answer.***  
>  
>**Jim Carrey**

Success will not make you happy. It will not fix you. 

**It will make your insecurities bigger. And your fears deeper.** 

Whether you’re a hobbyist, a DIY independent act or a successful artist or producer, if you want to avoid creative misery then you have to stop focusing on outcomes.

You can’t control outcomes. They control you. All you can control is your effort, your attitude and your reactions. 

**Trust me. It took me two decades to work this out.** 

We all want approval — especially in our creative work.

The problems begin when we chase them. When we start creating material we think *you* will like, instead of what *we* love to do. Or becoming a person we *think* you will like, instead of being ourselves. 

**We lose our identities.**

If our identities and self-worth are welded to our creative success; our happiness and fulfilment are in the hands of others. 

Everyone wants to be happier. But you won’t find it in the approval of others. It doesn’t matter if you’re trying to please 100 or 100,000 fans, the results are the same.

The applause of strangers and critics are like a drug, the more you get, the more you will need. 

**It’s chasing happiness and fulfilment on a hedonic treadmill. You will never catch it.** 

The joy is in the process. It’s in the marginal gains and mastering your craft.

It devoting yourself to being the best artist and creative you can be regardless of the outcomes. It’s creating for yourself and not others. 

The only comparison is with yourself. Am I better today than I was last month? Am I an artist or creative who is true to themselves?

True artists create what they love regardless of what you think. 

**Be authentic.**

Accept yourself for what you are. Accept yourself for what you are not. 

**People will respect you for being true.**

**But more importantly, you will respect yourself for being** ***you.*** 

Peace out

434,Best. Request. Ever.,216,11bq8k0,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/11bq8k0/best_request_ever/,88,"I got a great request last night and it kinda made my night.

I have a weekly residency at a bar in Seattle that is themed like a space ship disco from the jungle.

I spin a bunch of disco deep cuts & edits, Brazilian disco, and  disco house. There is a small dance floor that is really more of a listening lounge people chill and drink in.

Last night it was pretty busy around 10pm and this fantastic request occurs:

""Do you do requests?!"" - Girl 1

""Sorry, vinyl only night, so requests are pretty hard. What are you looking for? I might have something if it's disco."" - me

:Blank stares:

""What's a popular disco song?"" - Girl 1

""Uhh, well that's why I'm here, because I know the popular disco songs and brought them with me"" - me

:Looks up from Google: - ""can you play ABBA? They were popular"" - Girl 2

""Uhh, sure, I'll get you an ABBA track in a few songs. I'm just starting the night off and need to build some energy for that."" - me

""Why not now? This isn't a popular song."" (I'm playing [AS - Mr K](https://youtu.be/AiCwhMO7jUE), it's only not popular to you, but I'll bite my tongue and play nice). - Girl 2

""That's now really how DJing works, I'm not a jukebox, but I'll mix your song in when it's ready. Trust me, I'm here every week and I'll play the hits."" - me

: Eye rolls and walks away :

Now I'm pretty annoyed by the interaction, but I try and be the better person and get the song in the queue.

I play Gimme, Gimme, Gimme 5 songs later. Me eyes eagled in on them. They aren't dancing. They don't even notice... But they notice me looking at them and this makes them come over and say ""when are you going to play ABBA?"" Girl 2

""This is ABBA..."" - me

""Oh, I've never heard of it, why was this popular?"" girl 1 

💀💀💀💀💀💀

I bring ABBA with my not because I like it, I actually dislike most of ABBA. I bring it for the requests. But this time I feel like I got Rick Rolled into playing a song I hate for a person who doesn't even know what the song is. I just couldn't stop laughing.",1677345569.0

Also wanted to share a pro-tip for those who, like myself, still struggle with letting go of soundcloud.

I use an IFTTT applet to automatically save every song I like on soundcloud, to a playlist on my spotify, and visa versa (if available). It has saved me a lot of time. The 3 applets that I use are linked below.

I know this is a small thing but the plural of “vinyl” is just “vinyl”. It is not “vinyls”. 

The word “vinyl” is both singular and plural. One record is called “vinyl”. Many records are also called “vinyl”. You can also call them “records” or sometimes “wax”, but just not “vinyls”. 

English is weird, what can I say?

Not that it matters, but if you’re spending all this money on records, it’s worth knowing what to call them.

As  many of you know, Reddit is acting extremely poorly in regards to its users, mods and community.

Many, many subs, some much larger than ours, are going dark temporarily or indefinitely to voice our frustration and displeasure with their blatant attempt to extract as much value as possible from the community before their upcoming IPO.

We recently held a poll to discuss what we should do. [Over 1,100 of you (85% of those who responded)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/141edkd/should_rdjs_go_dark_on_june_12th_to_support_3rd/) decided to support our community and go dark, starting tomorrow, lasting for ~~an indefinite amount of time~~ **at least 48 hours.**

Since then, things have escalated significantly. Reddit staff and executives have been lying, gaslighting, and generally ignoring the requests of the people who make this site thrive; you, me, and all users and volunteer mods. [See this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/145vns0/the_future_of_rvideos/) from [r/videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/) describing what has happened and why they will be going dark, indefinitely.

**This post is to confirm that yes,** [r/DJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/) **will go dark, starting from tomorrow (June 12th), for AT LEAST 48 hours but POSSIBLY for an indefinite amount of time** until Reddit responds and/or changes its policies.

We don't know how long this will last, but here are a few things to consider (ht to the mods at [r/videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/) for this):

**Short FAQ:**

**Q: Won’t Reddit just remove you as moderators and reopen the subreddit?**

>A:   This is a distinct possibility, Reddit has made it clear that the “health” of their site is more important to them. We as a team are prepared for this, none of us want to continue to volunteer for a   company that disrespects the people who helped  build it into the front page of the internet.

**Q: An indefinite lockdown? I thought this was only supposed to be for 48 hours?**

>A:   Originally it was our intention to spread awareness of these issues, but over the past week it has become clear that Reddit doesn’t intend to   act in good faith, and our role in the protest became clear. The owners of Reddit have taken their users, community developers, and their  moderator teams for granted and used them to build up a multimillion dollar company which is now focused not on the community, but on how  many commas they can get out of Silicon Valley investors.

**Q: What can we as users do to support this protest?**

>A:   The best way you can make your opinion known is by stopping using reddit. At the very least you can try and reduce your usage of the site,   consider using alternatives such as [**Tildes**](https://tildes.net/) which I’ve personally found to be a nice change of pace from the traditional Reddit experience.

As others have said, it's been a hell of a ride. We hope this won't be the end, but it could be. We could get kicked off as mods and banned, permanently.

If that happens, thank you to everyone who has made [r/DJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/) an incredible space for learning, sharing, and celebrating this thing we all hold so dear.

If that doesn't happen, however, and the public and media backlash is so great that Reddit reverses course, well then, brothers and sisters, see you at the after party on the other side!

Keep on mixing, [r/DJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/). From all of us mods here at [r/DJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/), it's been a pleasure.",1686466024.0

It soon became obvious that the resident was a high functioning alcoholic. In fact, pretty much every resident of the many clubs in town were, at the very least, chugging a hefty dose every night. 

Bartenders are [2.33 times more likely than average to die from an alcohol-related death](https://www.alcoholrehabguide.org/resources/professionals/). DJs are probably in the same boat. 

We have a job where we’re not only allowed to drink, but alcohol is free, the public we’re catering to is drunk and often offer you drinks.

Be careful, alcohol addiction can sneak up on you very easily. Be mindful of how much and how often you partake.

I used to have trouble practicing enough, because I would get bored with what I was doing. I was talking to a DJ friend about this, and he told me I shouldn't ever be bored while I'm practicing and/or performing. He said ""If you're bored, you're boring."" If you're bored, the audience probably is too.

I've been able to use this advice to make DJing a lot more fun for myself, and hopefully for people around me too! If I start feeling bored I know that's when I have to do something - add FX, use an Acapella, switch the track, whatever! It's helped me to make way cooler sets and to be way more motivated to practice. Now when I get bored in practice it's exciting because I immediately stop what I'm doing, and get to take the challenge of making things cool again.

I would appreciate it if you would still give it a read however and share your thoughts under this post. 

Before I explain why I don't understand the praise, I want to say that I love both Skrillex and Fred Again, they're amazing artists, Skrillex, in particular, having lots of history and Fred Again literally just breathing music ever since we've known about him. I have no clue who Four Tet is but everyone calls him some sort of legend, it might be because I'm not from the US. This might be part of the problem. 

What first should be noted is that it was clear that the trio did not prepare a show. I loved to see that they had fun on stage and were trying random things out and making them work, but it was clear that they were just doing it as they went. If their music was not as widely known as it currently is, it most likely wouldn't really have resonated because of the many long pauses, and since this was the closing act of Coachella I can imagine anyone there is desperate for any party they can still get. 

Now knowing that they probably figured it all out as they went, I did like the transitions that Skrillex made in particular, but I also know him to be a talented DJ and didn't really expect much less from him. Also, Fred Again making the crowd feel like a brotherhood must have been amazing. 

But then, Four Tet. I really don't know who he is, and Wikipedia isn't helping me much. I would like to point out his main additions to the set:

1. Oftentimes completely different from the flow of the set, he would play a (famous) song that randomly transitioned into Dubstep. I love Dubstep but if I didn't know that this was Coachella I would be convinced he was trolling. 
2. A good rewind never hurts, giving the song the love it deserves and reliving the buildup and potentially unexpected banger that drops after. But Four Tet did it 4 TIMES on 1 song. 4 times in a row. I got so annoyed after the second already. 
3. Some pop/punk song that is very famous, for sing along. I'm an all-round DJ myself and play songs like that all the time, I love them and when it fits the artist I love listening to them on a festival as well. But they were just so... random. Skrillex and Fred Again would create a vibe and suddenly there was American rock playing. Again, I'm convinced the reason it even partly worked is because people there were so desperate for a party they would vibe to anything they were able to vibe to, and I too love singing my heart out to sing along music. But it just didn't make any sense. 

There were also very long pauses oftentimes that got me out of the flow and honestly, I'm glad they had a great time but I don't like that it's praised so much more than it probably should. However, I would like to know your thoughts, and in particular why my perception of it might be so against what other people think!",1683737920.0

Having said that, with the advent of technology, every piece of kit from your lowly entry level controllers all the way to the club standard CDJ 3000 come with a sync button. Sooooo…. why the he’ll is everyone in the DJ community so against using the sync button when mixing??? It’s there for a reason. The crowd could give a rats a$$ if you’re blending with sync or not, so why so much hate against using sync. I can beat match no problem, but using sync allows me to put more of my time and effort into things like rocking 4 decks and using effects and it’s a boon when incorporating acoustic music that goes off beat.

I'm aging myself here by the fact that it was a roller skating rink (lol). I learned to beat mix and follow a format on an old GLI mixer, mismatched turntables, and EQ/Amps that were locked up where I couldn't touch them, but I was the DJ. Fast forward to my senior year of high school, a friend of a friend refers me to come talk to this guy who owned a local mobile DJ business. I'd heard of the business, they did all the high school proms and such. The guy was a businessman with an MBA degree, but using his intelligence to basically rule the region in the DJ business. He ran upwards of 15 systems each weekend, with a staff of one DJ per system, and a couple roadies per system.  We had some elaborate setups - not only did we have the two turntables, UREI 1620 mixers, Crown power amps, but also video screens, lights, and a 55 gallon heated dry ice drum that we would use at gigs.

This guy was incredibly smart, engineering and building his own lighting controllers, snake cables, coffin consoles (before these were mass produced like the ones we have today), designing and building his own speakers and subwoofers, before adopting the mass production JBL stuff, designing light fixtures that would fit perfectly into a road case, and the road cases all were measured to fit exactly into the trucks a certain way. Every little detail was thought out. And then there was his customer interaction which was always spot-on. He would always coach each DJ going to each job on the room they were going to, the manager at the venue and how to talk to them, detailed diagrams of each venue and where to get the 5 or 6 individual circuits we needed for power, everything.

To say that working for this guy, I learned a lot, is a huge understatement. And he got the jobs. Just before I joined, he took his system to play a Super Bowl party back in the 80s (he remembers meeting OJ and Al Cowlings at some party with CBS people EDIT: This had to be 83 or 87, as I remember it being in Los Angeles, and Simpson/Cowlings weren't players, but they were at the event), a prominent local CEO's wedding and also his holiday party as his ski resort in Colorado, and numerous other high end jobs. Also a recurring booking for one of the larger ballroom NYE parties in Chicago, at one point, I think he had that job for 27 years straight. We did weddings, school parties, and corporate events, but the big money was in the bar mitzvah world. You have an entire audience of kids who can't wait to one-up each other. So he would bring more give-aways, better give-aways, to the point where the blow-up toys and stuffed animals he would give away as prizes throughout the night was costlier than his booking fee. But it was all margin, and it was very lucrative!

I worked for him in high school, then moved on and did something else for a few years, but then met up and rejoined him a few years later for a few more years of work, and then he started to slow down and move out of the business as he moved to another city with a new wife. This also resulted in him  shifting his business towards photography. His thinking there was he had the customer service and sales skills, plus could work with couples approximately the same way as when doing the DJ thing, and that worked great. And he could load and unload photography gear by himself, whereas not so much with the DJ gear anymore.

About 4 years ago, I'm talking to him, and he's telling me that he had some kind of neurological  event. It stemmed from when he was doing a job and a light tree did not have the outrigger legs secured properly, and it crumbled down on top of his leg.  After that injury he was on blood thinners, but apparently whatever happened, he was OK afterwards. At least for a while. Then two years ago, while I was out Christmas shopping (this is one of those things where you remember where you were when you got the call) I get a call from my wife that he has called our house and wanted to say hello, but my wife was telling me to call him right away because he didn't sound right.  I call him back later that evening, and something has happened - he can't carry a conversation, he can't complete a thought, and so on.  Since, I have gotten to visit him a couple times, once at his place, and he and his wife traveled up to here and I got to visit then. But recently, his wife shared that he's losing coherency, not recognizing her, and stuff like that. Basically, he is about gone, and it makes me so sad to see someone who I admired so much and was - in my younger mind - what I wanted to grow up to be, withering away.  I want to talk to him, but there's really not much of a conversation. I can only ask so many yes/no questions about things he can answer like the weather, the dog, etc.

This is probably way too long, and perhaps a bit o/t, but let me leave you with this -- if there's someone in your life that you saw or looked up to as a mentor, a friend, a crazy uncle you wish was actually your uncle, tell them how much of an impact they have had on you.

And if you're the old guy, and you've got folks you work with and you're training them, know how much your style, your actions, your ""vibe"" is being picked up by the younger ones.",1640145102.0

First of all, I didn't use any of your songs, but thanks for sharing, great stuff in there.

So, played some funk as a warm up, people came in, ate a bit at the buffet and had a drink. Some girls started on the pole, which was right in front of me :D 

Pretty soon people got semi undressed, and nearly all women were in their undies. I just hammered the new popular stuff. Everyone got to vote on their favorites hotter people, both guys and girls. Played 'You can leave your hat on'. Some did.

I then switched up all genres, old and new. The dance floor was fluctuating a lot as people went upstairs, then came back. The boss took on after me and I danced with a girl.

Lots of rooms upstairs, beds, red lights, showers. And of course, people fucking everywhere.

Came back, played mixed up again, RnB, French, ragga, classics, news, whatever. All in all I did pretty much as I would have for any other night, as someone advised me rightly in pm.

It was winding down towards 2am. Most everyone was at it in the bedrooms so I put on a playlist and did dive in. I left at 4.

10/10 would do again. I'm booked for the next one.

I've created a website that extracts audio stems from songs using Spleeter, Demucs3, and Open Unmix. I've tried to provide as many options for each tool as possible. All tracks are always free to download with no sign-up. I'm running the server on a personal computer, as a personal project, so I'm unsure as to how it will scale with users. The processing depends on which Models you use, spleeter tends to take a minute or two, Demucs3 can take up to 10 minutes to finish processing, and Open Unmix completes in under 5 minutes.

649,Why high schoolers are hard to please,173,1cun3p,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1cun3p/why_high_schoolers_are_hard_to_please/,62,"There have been a few posts in the past about why it sucks to play high school dances and other events for teenagers.  I have done quite a few high school dances with great success but, I have access to what many others don't... three teenage daughters.  These three girls have wildly varying tastes in music but, they are a wealth of information for me.  I don't generally ask them outright about what music they like, but I instead listen for what they are listening to in their rooms, or I take a look at our rhapsody account to see what is getting played.

By and large, these kids will only listen to what is currently hot in any genre that they choose to listen to.  They also don't listen to much EDM except for the stuff being played on the radio.  And yes, I have caught all three of them playing levels over and over again.

This was further evidenced by a statement that my daughter made today concerning her prom.  When I asked her how it went, she said the prom was good but, the music ""sucked because the DJ kept playing stuff from 2010"".  She said the dance floor was at best moderately packed all night.  

Her statement is very telling.  When playing in bars and clubs, We as DJs, can get away with dropping music from a wide variety of time periods because adults have experienced music from a wide variety of time periods.  

Kids on the other hand don't begin to develop their own musical identity until around the onset of puberty.  Before that, the music they hear is largely controlled by those people around them.  When you look back on your life, chances are, you will associate a soundtrack to go with those memories.  Music makes and enhances memories.  

To teenagers, those memories are being made right now in the moment.  They correlate music with new and exciting experiences that are happening to them now.  Music that happened even just a couple years back is not ""their"" music.  To them, those are somebody else's memories.  Of course, there are exceptions.  I can still fill a dance floor with California Love or Lil John's ""Get Low"" but by and large, I only play music less than a year old.  I have never once received a request for the Black Eyed Peas, S&M by Rihanna, or anything else hot just a couple years ago at a high school dance.

So, go into these gigs with an open mind, and don't get caught up in trying to play what you consider to be ""good music"".  Play popular music because to your audience, that is ""good music"".  By doing this, you would be helping these kids make memories that will last a lifetime and, you will also increase your bookings.  Also, go easy on the remixes and, a little scratching will make you DJ Royalty to these kids.

Using the app I can focus more on how I want the night to progress and my mixing skills rather than worrying about what songs to play next. Also, I have discovered that people make fewer song requests, and ask to skip songs during house parties, because songs with similar features are progressed gradually, so it flows a lot better, and things don’t feel out of place.

This is my first app, so feedback would be greatly appreciated. Also, not sure if this counts as self promotion because the app is minimally monetized with banner ads, most of it going towards server costs.

Long story short, I've loved music for as long as I can remember, my dad was a DJ when I was a kid so throughout my childhood I always had the equipment at home, the afternoon sessions my dad used to play to practice, helping him to organize cables and pack his stuff for his events.

I used to watch the Tomorrowland Aftermovies of 2015-16 and dreamt about one day being the big headliner.

I then moved to another country, grew up, and had to start working to make a living for myself and my little brother.

6 years later, I had a pretty good 6-figure income on marketing design working with 9-figure companies. And I was really good at it, huge companies would start competing to hire me.

And I really liked it - but it didn't make me happy. I wasn't passionate about it, I was just thrilled I was earning a good salary working 6 hours a day.

During the pandemic, I bought myself a DDJ-1000SRT to play at home and distract myself every now and then from work and not being able to go out.

Then, over a year ago, I was at a nightclub with some friends, and noticed the DJ that was playing sucked - he couldn't match any song the right way. My friends didn't notice cause they aren't DJs and honestly were kind of drunk, but I did - so I walk up to the manager of the place and asked him to play one day.

At this point, I had never played in front of an audience other than maybe 5-6 friends, I had no idea about DJing in a nightclub but I went with it.

He agreed - and 2 weeks later gave me the opportunity to play for about an hour.

Clearly, I sucked - but I loved the feeling, so I kept on practicing every day with my DDJ-1000.

Eventually, a few months later, I started playing at the biggest nightclubs in my town - and people loved it when I had to play - the nightclub would get 50-60+ extra people when they hired me.

And as I practiced more and more, I came across more and more music – until eventually, feel in love with melodic techno.

For months, we would just sit in my living room with my friends, smoke weed, and listen to melodic techno mixes all night.

But there aren't nightclubs for melodic techno in my town, not even techno in general – maybe a few for electronic music in general but that's about it.

There was only 1 festival in my town for this kind of music, so I got my tickets, went with my friends and... hated it. It was the worst organization I've ever seen in my life for an event.

I'm not going into details, but yeah, it was terrible.

What surprised me even more was that, my town is not that small. There are 6 million people living here, and techno has become extremely mainstream in the last few months mostly because of the Afterlife hype - so, where are all the events? The nightclubs? The festivals?

What about... if I started organizing REALLY good techno events? Not raves, more like Cercle (if you haven't seen them, go on YouTube and you'll get the idea).

Bring 500-600 people to a really iconic place during sunset, and play some great electronic and techno music.

No fancy scenario, not an abandoned factory - but beautiful, iconic venues.

So I started to look into it, and decided to organize my first event.

Rather quickly I noticed it wasn't as easy as I thought it was - putting together an event is A LOT of work. More than anything I've ever had to do in my marketing career.

BUT I LOVED IT!!!

I enjoyed every challenge, every tough conversation, every obstacle.

And I knew at that point, that was what I wanted to do.

So I quit my 6-figure marketing job to become an event producer of my own events, in the most iconic places of my country.

And the first one is this Saturday, right next to the biggest pyramid in the world (and nope, it's not Giza in Egypt, look it up on Wikipedia... ;)

It's a venue for up to 100 people - and we have a waiting list.

This is - by far - the riskiest decision I've ever made (I'm 24 y/o so I don't have THAT many but still lol), and I feel happy with it.

Just wanted to tell this story to people like you guys, who would understand what it means to feel passion for music, not just 'I like music'.

And let's see where this takes me.

Her 18-year-old daughter was having her graduation party the next night and the DJ they lined up unexpectedly backed out on the gig. She had made a few calls to other DJs but they said they weren't comfortable taking such specific requests. She got my name from a friend and said I'm her only hope. At this point I'm thinking there's no way I'm taking it based on that info alone, but I told her to lay out the details and we'll talk. Here are the specifics:

- 500-600 people in attendance
- Everybody will want to dance the entire night
- There will be an equal mix of family and friends

Sounds reasonable so far...

- All of the family is Lebanese
- They want Lebanese music (um...)
- They will provide said Lebanese music (eh...)
- They want me from 8pm-1am (I'm thinking, here's where they tell me they have a $150 budget)
- Nope. They will pay me $1,000 cash

Deal for real!! The mom was beyond thankful. 

I got set up by 7:30 and was handed a book of Lebanese CDs with a printout of when to play each track. More directions: if there are kids who want modern music, play it for them. Take any and all request. Aye aye, ma'am. 

8:00 rolls around and I'm greeted by at least 100 people between the ages of 5 and 15, ready to dance. Following them are 5 middle-aged women carrying plates full of food, all of it for me. I'm stuffing my face... everything was exotic and amazing. No clue what any of it was called. Lots of chicken and sauces and hummus and fried deliciousness... God I'm salivating just thinking about it.

By 9:00 I've played only modern music for the kids, including songs from their phones--take the AUX cord, kid. I couldn't have cared less. The dance floor is starting to really fill up with older kids and adults. It's time for the Lebanese music.

I hit play on this one song and immediately the place erupts. 200 people start doing a ""dabke"" dance and loving every second of it. I play 10 of these in a row and every song is a huge hit. Sweaty, laughing people everywhere. By 11:00 there had to be 400 people on this dance floor. Even the American kids are getting down and trying to learn the steps. After a while I start to mix in some American music and I can do no wrong. Everybody was having the time of their life. I'm everyone's best friend at this party. One uncle practically wanted my autograph.

It goes like this until 1 and I'm notified I need to cut the sound. The mom approaches me with the biggest smile on her face and hands me an envelope. Thanks me for a solid 2 minutes saying I saved the party and the family has never had more fun. I pack up, get in my car, open the envelope... $2,000 cash. Un-fucking-believable!

Apparently the owner has told them that I will give them a set, and decide whether they can play more regularly. Considering I seem to be the only EDM DJ around, and playing for 8 hours a night is exhausting, I take them up on their offer.

""What decks do you use?"" I ask tentatively.

""Oh, we just use our laptops...""

*sigh*

""Of course you do..."" At this point I'm already somewhat indifferent, yet I further the conversation, jumping to an understandable conclusion, ""Are you using Virtual DJ?"".

""Nah, man; we're using Windows Media Player.""

Windows. Media. Player.

Not only can these guys not be arsed to learn a ""DJ"" program as simple as VDJ, but they can't even use a decent media player, instead choosing to go with whatever came stock: ""Hey, bro! Our new DJ laptop totally just arrived, dudebro! I'm not sure what software to use, broman brosefstein,  but it looks like this Windows Media Player came pre-loaded! Score, bro bro macbroferton!""

Fucking fuck.

So, against my better judgement, I decided to let them play for an hour. There was no hint of mixing. They literally played one track after the other, with a pause in-between as they furiously double-clicked to the next track. 

But hey, most people don't give a shit as long as you drop Levels, which they did. Three times. In an hour. So at least they had a bit of a crowd going.

Their crowning achievement, however, was not their pre-planned Media Player playlist (which actually made their presence behind the laptop completely moot), but rather the fact that they were using my mixer to ""mix"" the EQ - one of the guys even had my headphones on.

Am I angry that they used my stuff without even asking? 

Well, I guess I would be, if any of it had even been switched on...

That's right. They were using my EQ, and could not tell that it was doing NOTHING. And, for some reason, they were using my headphones, through which nothing was playing but total silence. 

Wut?

But wait there's more:

They expect to get paid. 

They expect to get paid more than me.

Hold the fucking phone.

I don't think I have ever been so insulted in my entire life.

Club owners/managers/etc, always pay your DJ, and pay them well. People always seem to get confused when it comes to paying the DJ, making excuses as to why they should get less money, and so on. The fact is, you are not paying for the one, two, three-hour set the DJ plays, you are paying for their **experience** - you are paying them for the hours and hours they spent practicing so that they could reach a point where they are able to hold a dancefloor. 

So please, tell me:

How in the ever-living fuck do these guys think they should get paid more than the resident DJ (who practices ""real mixing"" no less than two hours a day) for LITERALLY doing nothing but pressing play?

Again, this is really just a rant, so feel free to downvote and ignore, but I'd love to hear your stories to know I'm not the only one experiencing this sort of bullshit.

TL;DR: Guys want to play at my club. Guys have one laptop. Guys use Windows Media Player. Guys expect to be paid more than me, the resident DJ. Fuck those guys.

A bit about of my dj path: I am a female artist, who started djing around 2,5-3 years ago, after I moved to Berlin my career looked to be quite promising, for 1 year living here I played at almost all biggest clubs including Tresor, often being in line ups with big names and became a resident of the one of the most popular radio stations of underground electronic music. I dont have an agent or agency, but would love to have since its really hard to find regular gigs by yourself. I consider myself as quite strong dj with my own sound, I am playing both vinyl and digital, recently also started producing my own music. Despite I am staying for the quality, always responsible and well prepared for gigs, playing unreleases and rare tracks, I still have 1 gig per month and my career doesnt seem to move forward. Seems that people simply dont care about you and your music if you dont have a big name or are not an influencer/fake dj with big audience in instagram. I dont party too often and not so good at social connections, but for 1 year living in Berlin I got some good contacts though. I feel very frustrated since last time I am getting a lot of requests for recording podcasts that people often skip and dont listen, but not real bookings at the clubs. I feel injustice because my efforts are much bigger than the outcome I am getting. Next year I am releasing my first track, but I am so unmotivated and desperate, that I even think to quit everything connected to music…however I know its my path and I sincerely love it.

I have been a DJ since 1998 and have been in IT (it's my day job) since 2009. I was wondering if y'all think there would be any benefit to starting a series (probably on YouTube) called IT for DJs given how inextricably linked these things are in today's DJ world.

The primary purpose of the series would be to discuss common IT ""stuff"" but to analyze the available data and metrics through the DJ lens and with DJ requirements in mind in an approachable way. An example topic would be SSD vs. HDD, so here's a few bullet points that might be discussed (partial list):

* What's the difference?
* Durability
* Speed (whether or not the highest-end SSD is required)
* Form factors (e.g. NVMe/2.5"")

I know lots of DJs are *also* in IT or have technology backgrounds, so I'm hardly rare, but I think there's also a ton of DJs out there who also aren't and the litany of data out there about how to select things can be hard to wade through.

I would want to be careful about providing *opinions* and focus on *just the data*, though there's no way a series like this will happen without me providing an opinion or two along the way, but I will do my best to provide balanced and fair views.

Assuming I can put together engaging videos, do you think there's value in this? And if so, what kind of topics would you like to see?

Don’t even get me started on CDJ firmware updates and Rekordbox updates not aligning. Pioneer needs to clean house over there and start running some serious quality control and compatibility tests on their gear, because every DJ i know complains about the same shit.

I’ve had about 4 gigs already and got asked to play at a pretty popular place on Cinco De Mayo along with 5 other djs (they’ve been in the game 10-20 years) 

Finally we got a text that showed our set times, I was playing 12-1am. I was pretty excited I was playing a late time and made sure I was prepared music wise. I downloaded popular Spanish music since it was Cinco and I also filled my crate with hip hop to get the crowd dancing. 

Long story short, I start playing. I’m nervous as HELL as all the other djs are kinda surrounding me. I felt like I had a lot to prove, especially since I was playing a 12am set. I’m not sure what the dj before me pressed but he had it to where I was playing on different channels that I’m not used to so I was so confused. 

It was a mess, I accidentally played the song back to back and not even 3 mins in the main dj pulled me off. She looked at me so annoyed and started getting another laptop out. 

I understood bc of how I was starting off but I wish she would’ve gave me time to fix my controller and gather myself together. She didn’t give me a chance or ask “hey what’s up?? Is everything good?” lol 

She proceeded to say “you obviously aren’t ready to dj, just because you’re pretty doesn’t mean you can just come in here and play. You don’t know what you’re doing” 

I was heated. I didn’t even get the chance to play and redeem myself! 😭

I was so upset and started beating myself up about it. I was embarrassed and humiliated in front of my friends and the other djs. I quickly starting spiraling into a pit and kept hearing her voice in my head. 

Thankfully I have a lot of dj friends and they reminded me to take this as a learning experience and to come back 10x harder. Djing takes practice and failed attempts. 

From this experience I learned that I need to learn my controller so the next time something happens I’m not confused. I also realized I need to develop thicker skin lol. 

I’m still pretty upset about it but I plan to keep going. I know I can be great, just gotta practice.

I’m 27 days sober. After taking a break from booking gigs for awhile, last night I performed one of my first sober DJ sets in a club for as long as I can remember. I’m thankful for not feeling like shit this morning but also feel really anxious that I just wasn’t really feeling the vibe last night. Finding my creative ‘flow state’ while sober has been an ongoing challenge due to alcohol being paired with mixing for nearly 2 decades. It was at a big club that I haven’t played at before and they had one of those massive video walls right behind the booth like you find at EDM festivals. The crowd was also way more EDM than what I normally play to and it all just felt off. I personally hate when us DJs are stuck on a stage with a huge backdrop and people just stand in that direction like it’s a concert. It’s not my style or preference, and I felt bad for the friends and fans who came out to hear what I normally play. I’ve been in my head about it since last night and keep fearing that maybe ‘I’ve lost it’ musically now that I’m sober.

I actually just showed my lady the old clip of [David Guetta’s ‘meltdown’](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mMFDxuh1zQo) to explain how it felt.

Anyway, everyone had positive things to say but I just wasn’t feeling it and maybe it’s all in my head. Time will tell. I hope it was just a weird night since I’m looking forward to exploring a sober flow state. Cheers.",1670685801.0

750,New online radio djs wanted,159,oxpz59,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/oxpz59/new_online_radio_djs_wanted/,160,"
I'm in the process of launching a new online radio statio and looking for anyone that wants to take part, if you want to set, play a prerecorded set thats all good.

Not matter your skill set, what genre you play we want to hear from you.

The main idea behind this new station is to promote djs and help to get their name - music out there. I want to create a fun loving community among djs and producers, a place where people can come and showcase their talent no matter the skill set even if youve just started or been at it for years, a place to get feedback and just enjoy music from any genre. 

It's will cost you nothing to join all I ask is for you to promote us and in return I will do the same on all of our social media, you will also get your own page with bio information contact number and links for your own social networks, music images anything you want to share.

About me and why to join.
I’ve been a dj from the early 90s playing break beat and slowly moved to trance and house, I’ve hosted a successful radio station 10 years ago but due to time commitments and having children it fadded away. Now my kids have grown up I’ve got back in to it and started doing live Facebook streams but the trouble with Facebook its copyright and getting streams taken down or cut of half way through.
Get in touch with your thoughts and how to get involved. The new station I hope to get up and running the next couple of weeks. I want to djs to be in control and play when they want not just set times. 

Divine Rhythms will be the new name. Thanks for reading I hope to hear back from you soon

UPDATE

After a lot of set backs the site is finally up but looking very bare , shot me over links to any mixes and I'll begin adding them 

Thanks everyone I'm getting really excited about this

Been at my current bar residency for about 6 and a half years through at least 4 different GMs. Over that time I've played on similar themes with variations according to trend. Open format - mainly commerical and classics from House and RnB with some UKG, DnB, Dancehall, Grime, Afrobeats, 90s/00s dancy cheese etc depending on the crowd and the night.

Always busy, always a good dancefloor and happy customers on the whole.

Last weekend we had a visit from senior management who are now suddenly unhappy with what I am doing. Whilst playing Single Ladies I was ordered to play some girly music. Whilst playing some House I was ordered to cut the record and immediately play some spice girls. I declined and was threatened with 'we pay your wages so do it'. I declined again. For the last hour I was ordered to play music that people can sing to but not dance to. Wtf?

Speaking with the manager the next day he was told to fire me. He refused. But apparently I will have to shift what I play to be what they deem girly pop - Abba, Spice Girls, Arianna Grande, Little Mix etc  - no remixes and the like. This will now be the main music focus for the night.

If they want to change the music then I understand completely; that's their call. But I wish to be treated as a professional, not like the dirt they spoke to me like. An actual professional to professional discussion and maybe we could have arrived at something workable. They way I was spoken to annoyed me for the rest of the night.

Anyway that music change carries no interest to me at all and whilst its a bit of a financial hit and I will miss performing, I'm thinking about calling it a day there with immediate effect.

Others are telling me I'm being too rash and to stick it out.",1659537719.0

773,I don't think I'll be getting a CDJ-3000 anytime soon.,154,iq9rl1,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/iq9rl1/i_dont_think_ill_be_getting_a_cdj3000_anytime_soon/,109," Alright so I've gone through the CDJ-3000 release documentation and here are my thoughts on the new CDJ-3000.

Background:  I've been DJing since 2009.  I adopted Virtual DJ back when it was a pile of ass and got on Serato ITCH when I got my first controller the Numark V7.  I currently own a pair of CDJ-2000 NXS.  I use them primarily as Serato controllers and occasionally run USB sticks.  So for me, the jump to a pair of CDJ-3000 would have to justify a $4600 investment.

The jump from CDJ1000MK3 to CDJ-2000 was massive.  HID support, digital libraries, record box, etc.  It meant more possibilities and more flexibility in DJ performances.  This was a must-have upgrade.

The jump from CDJ2000 to NXS and NXS2 is more subtle but still game-changing.  Better processing meant less buffering.  Touch screens and more controls provided even more flexibility.  Larger and larger screens for easier tracking.  But unlike the 1000-2000 jump, these revisions were not essential.  The CDJ-2000 operated very similarly to the NXS and NXS2.  There are quality of life improvements but they were basically interchangeable.

Now that the CDJ-3000 launched, I was expecting something similar to the CDJ1000-2000 jump.  Improvements that are so good that DJ's can't live without it.  But unfortunately, I don't think that is the case.  Let me explain why.

I bought a CDJ-2000 NXS because I wanted to be familiar with this generation of CDJ players while also being able to leverage my computer for sets.  I avoided the CDJ1000MK3 because it was effectively a different machine.  Learning and playing on that would be a waste of time.  This warranted the price tag of the CDJ2000NXS.

The CDJ-3000 is effectively a CDJ2000 NXS2 with a 9"" touchscreen instead of a 7"" touch screen.  They tout improvements in their audio DAC hardware but from the CDJ2000 on we've been able to play WAV and FLACC files and the sound quality was very high.  Considering that these units are not studio recording devices and club systems are inherently messy in their signal to noise ratio, this improvement will likely be undetectable.

The ability to run 6 CDJ-3000's at the same time, although impressive, is wildly impracticable.  I've rarely seen performers use 4 decks at the same time let alone 6.  Unless your set-up REQUIRES 6 decks, this feature will never be used.

The added hot cues buttons are nice but the CDJ2000 line already has 3/4 hot cue buttons.  An extra 2 is not a deal-breaker.

A lot of the features stated on the official website are already things that the CDJ2000 line can do.  Advanced Looping, Lossless file types, DJ Link (You just need to run Rekordbox to use this), Key Sync and Shift, etc.

Honestly, the main advantage of the CDJ-3000 is the 9"" touchscreen.  It can display overlapping and 3Band waveforms.  But if you use a computer at all with this system it's pretty redundant as your computer will display this info better and clearer.  This is a nice feature for USB only DJ's but the CDJ2000 line already has overlapping beat indicators that effectively do the same thing.

The other thing that it has is robustness.  The locking power cord is a well-needed feature for clumsy DJs and the metal construction is a nice touch.  But it doesn't change how a DJ interacts with the device.

They also removed the CD drive.  Normally I wouldn't care as CD DJ's are not common but it does bring up the question of the XDJ-1000 platform.  The XDJ platform was considerably less expensive than the CDJ2000NXS and yet the CDJ-3000 is priced in a similar range as the CDJ2000NXS2 and not the XDJ-1000MK2.  This is likely due to the improved construction but a $1000 difference is pretty steep.

All of this is to say that I'm not going to be replacing my CDJ2000NXS with these anytime soon.  A near $5000 investment for a CDJ2000NXS with a nicer screen and metal faceplate is just not worth it for me.

Here's my suggestion for anyone looking at buying pioneer equipment right now.

\- If you NEED the CD slot, pick up a used CDJ200 - CDJ2000NXS2  They'll be more cost-effective and give you a similar experience

\- If you are starting out and buying your first DJ equipment, get a DDJ-1000 controller.  2 platters plus a mixer for 1/2 the cost of ONE CDJ-3000.  Plus when you hook it up to a laptop with Pioneer Reckordbox it'll perform pretty much the same.

\- If you are using USB sticks, buy the XDJ1000-MK2.  It's half the price of the CDJ3000 and even has a 7"" touch screen.

Considering that Denon offers a similar product with more features $1000 less than the CDJ3000 I think Pioneer is banking on the inertia of their Club DJ standard status to drive sales.

I can't wait to read a DJ rider that request 6 DJ3000's and a pioneer V10 mixer just so they can look cool and play on barely 3 decks.

TLDR: Meh, not worth the replacement.",1599764334.0

Someone would bring a pair of 1200s, a mixer, Serato SL1, and a laptop and we’d just do drugs and jam out. 

I’ve since grown up, got a professional degree, earned some real money, and bought a house. Since I have a den (i.e. man cave) now, I finally have the space and the means to get whatever I want.

Unfortunately one of the LCD jogwheel screens went kaput while I was transferring music to the Internal Hard Drive. I only had it for maybe two months of ownership by this point, so I decided to proceed with an RMA to get it fixed. I wholeheartedly regret that decision right now. 

So I made [this forum post](https://denondjforum.com/t/another-victim-of-jog-wheel-display-crashing-also-my-1-4-is-stuck-in-mic-input/23190) over two months ago before deciding to go through with an RMA. I was waiting to see if I could get any input from an Admin or Staff member but literally zero members reached out to me. Check the comment section and only a few other users gave their two cents on what to do. I made [this thread on /r/DenonPrime](https://old.reddit.com/r/DenonPrime/comments/hbmww9/well_shit/) to maybe get some extra feedback but they all said to contact support.

So I head over to the support page and [filled out this form](https://www.denondj.com/support). I waited over a week with zero response back to my email or phone number so I decided to fill out the form again and send another request. Another week goes by without any response, so I decided to call the Phone Number on the [right hand of the page](https://www.denondj.com/support). Some dude called Al immediately picked up (immediate is emphasized, we'll explain why later) and apologized for the emails that haven't been answered. He provided me with the Packing Slip and RMA number and I officially dropped it off at [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/apps/fedextrack/?tracknumbers=770903842361) on July 14th, where it was delivered a week later on July 21st. 

After two entire weeks of being at the Warehouse I haven't received any calls or emails regarding a status update of my RMA. Remember how I said when Al picked up it was immediate? Every subsequent call I made since my unit has been at the warehouse, I have been placed on hold for over 40 minutes before speaking to someone. Even going as long as [more than an hour](https://i.imgur.com/S2a0d4G.jpg). The first person I managed to get in contact with, dudes name was Sam, told me that my unit was actually getting ready to be shipped back later today! Great! I asked him for a tracking number and he said he would email it to me later in the day. A whole ass day goes by with no response. I call back, wait like 40 minutes on hold, then a man named Nick picks up the phone. He puts me on another 20 minute hold to inquire wtf was going on and why it was taking so long to find a damn tracking number. Turns out Sam from yesterday was lying! My Prime 4 was scheduled to be replaced but they did not have any stock at all in the warehouse so instead they ordered a replacement piece to try and repair my unit instead (which I would've preferred in the first place because if you browse the forums you would know this is somewhat of a common issue). But basically Sam lied about the unit being shipped out and now I have to wait possibly another week while they start to fix my damn controller.

I tried going to the Official Facebook Group to see someone could help me out there. The page said to [DM them.](https://i.imgur.com/9p1F541.jpg) I copied and pasted my original post into their message board. Guess what? [They never replied.](https://i.imgur.com/NuBdJH4.png)

A week and a half later, still no status updates, I decided to call back (this is August 25th, yesterday of this post and over one month since the unit has been at their warehouse). A man named Jesus answers and tells me that the unit is actually getting shipped out later today! Great! Can I have a tracking number please?! ""I'll call you right back with that information later today chief""... Surprise, Surprise. I never got called back.

So about 10 minutes before I started writing this lengthy post furiously, I called back and got in contact with another guy (forgot his name, hard to keep track at this point) and he tells me after a brief hold that the warehouse was unable to repair my unit and they were planning to replace the unit but after one entire fucking month **THEY STILL DON'T HAVE ANY STOCK IN THE WAREHOUSE**.

TL;DR: So just to recap, Denon refused to reply to me on their official forums, Ignored their emails, never sent me status updates of my $1,800 unit in their possession, **LIED TO ME TWICE ABOUT SHIPPING MY UNIT BACK TO ME**, and are now over their promised ""2-4 week turnaround"" policy. 

The thing is, I genuinely enjoy what Denon DJ is trying to accomplish as the underdog in a market that's been almost entirely monopolized by Pioneer for the last two decades. Their products are genuinely innovating, and while I had my Prime 4 I had various other fellow DJ's tell me that they were seriously impressed by the gear. It wasn't perfect but it was a step above in feature sets what any comparable Pioneer unit has to offer at a more competitive price point. This Customer Service sham needs to be addressed faster than Prime Engine OS was because this shit is meaningless if they can't promise to hold customers faith for their semi-unreliable hardware mishaps. 

I just want to get my controller back already and spin some epic releases that came out in this packed month. Thank you for reading, feel free to share for exposure.



*UPDATE*: A few hours after this was posted, an InMusic Brands Manager told me a replacement unit was being shipped out within two business days at the expense of it being a B-Stock (refurbished) model. Fortunately, aside from some scratches that are only visible in direct light, the replacement is working perfectly and looks great! Although I could've sworn the gray knobs had a little bit more of a heavier feel to them. This replacement unit makes it feel like they are very light, but that's no concern. I'm just glad to be spinning on a Prime 4 again. I hope Denon's RMA process from here on out becomes a smoother experience going forward. 

It is important to mention that two other people in this thread have reported the exact same issue that caused me to RMA my original unit in the first place. You can read about that [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ih2hwx/if_you_value_customer_service_never_buy_a_denon/g2xo40p/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ih2hwx/if_you_value_customer_service_never_buy_a_denon/g30adb1/). This was not an isolated incident and I'm praying that my replacement model does not suffer the same fate. I hope Denon can find a solution for this issue because not having that jog wheel display working makes it more tedious for me to switch between Decks 2 & 4 and automatically know what song is loaded on said decks. Hopefully they manage to get a more reliable Power Supply Unit manufactured for the jogwheel displays.",1598460652.0

That can sound dumb but when I was younger I thought it was a really big deal to organize parties.

After running some independent ones when I was in University, I figured out it was worth the effort and also a way to earn some money.

What do you think about the idea?

EDIT: Here is the guide

This post concerns all the DJs who wish to organize parties but never took action because of a lack of opportunity, fear, or imposter syndrome. I wrote it after organizing 10+ independent house and techno events on my campus in a Swedish city when I was studying for my Master's. 

I didn’t speak the language, we didn’t really have money, and I had weak DJ skills. 

However, we managed to find an opportunity, we caught it, and we figured out it was not as complicated as we thought. 

This is why I am sharing it with you right now (and also because I want to promote Lesk, I won’t lie).

**1) Ask people around you**

Ask your friends or connections…

...if they want to organize events too. It’s a funny activity, you can eventually start earning money and it makes you a cool/active person. 

The first and easiest step to do is to ask among your friends and/or to post a story on social media. “Who would start an organization for making parties” and you would be impressed by the number of people ready to do something.

If your close friends are not really up for that, start asking people around you that can be interested. Maybe at your school, work, university and so on. As this is work as well a passion, you don’t have to be friends with the people you’re organizing something. 

Keep in mind that you should at least have compatible tastes for music. Once you have found people, you can start motivating each other.

2) **Connect with local artists and local party people.** 

Start connecting with local party people to localize opportunities… 

...send messages to see if you can connect or help them to organize events. If you are ready to work for free to get experience, you will start meeting people. Then, you will make connections and see opportunities everywhere.

Once you start frequenting those people, you will be in the world of party organizing. There, you will understand how everything works. More opportunities will pop up. The people you frequented might even help you organize other things.

DJs and promoters often have tons of ideas and tasks to do. If you help them to accomplish them, they might welcome you. Be careful, do not transform yourself into a slave. If you don’t find your pleasure in helping people, don’t. This is not the point.

The point is to get the contacts for artists, places, experiences, and anything worth taking.

3) **Create a “fictive” proper concept**

Start ideating a concept or party you want to create…

...write it on a piece of paper. Show this to your friends to see if it makes sense and if people would come. Then, find a name generate some beautiful aesthetics. You can create a logo, fonts, colors, and most importantly, a poster. 

Finally, create your social media accounts that are useful, the ones where you can spread the word to the people you desire to invite.

You don’t need to be perfect. You need to exist, be understandable, be found, and be accessible. People need to project themselves into your event. Even if it’s not the reality yet.

Here, getting likes is not the goal. The goal is to show people that your thoughts start taking place.

To make it more professional, do not hesitate to generate your visuals with the help of Photoshop or Gimp tutorials. Or find free templates, you’ll find plenty.

4) **Find a place to throw your party and negotiate a percentage**

There are plenty of restaurants or bars that have sound systems but have a hard time attracting customers. They are craving to make money. Then, organizing an event is a perfect way to do so.

If you know enough artists to perform, If you know how to spread the word to attract enough people then they might be interested in you. (and with social media it can be really easy)

The goal here is to organize an event and take a fee out of it. This fee can be the entrance ticket or a percentage of all the sales during the night.

Why is that better than a simple gig? Because of the purpose, you will create. The hype will be bigger, people will come for the atmosphere you will create and this is where you can do something bigger than the bar/restaurant owner.

Take your concept with you and visit the clubs, bars, and restaurants. Ask them if you can work together. If they reject you, this is normal. Just don’t forget that you need only one “Yes” to organize your first party.

Be smart on the location you’re choosing, not too chic, not too far from people, something that makes sense.

Understand also which kind of place you’re dealing with. Sometimes, they already have people organizing events, and they don’t think you bring that much value. 

Sometimes, they regret their ancient time and would love someone to reactivate their old soul. In any case, you need to understand why they want to do business with you. It will let you know how big of a fee you can take.

5) **Manage people and artists**

Many local artists and people would love to promote their local scene, which means that you might find people interested in working with you...

...for artists, ask for their mixes and their style. Then, you will be able to understand the type of music they are playing. Depending on their energy, you will determine when they will play.

Understand which kind of energy they can bring depending on the place’s frequency.

Place the less skilled when people are not here and the most experienced when people are here, even if YOU are the least skilled.

For the people working with you, you will have to split the tasks. The best way to do so is to plan AHEAD.

If you’re leading, you will be the one organizing shifts and work. As you’re working with people, don’t forget that they might be late or lazy doing stuff. Prepare in advance and make them have an easy time while accomplishing it.

Understand why people are doing what they are doing. It will help you understand why they act the way they behave. 

Someone who wants to become the next David Guetta might tell you the day before he won’t come if he finds a better gig. 

Someone who wants to improve the local scene might help your competitors without seeing any problem. 

If you understand that, you will avoid problems in the future.

PS: Bring AT LEAST food and drinks to your crew and DJs. It doesn’t have to be fancy, it just needs to show that you have considered.

6) **Market your party**

To make your event credible, you will need to make several pieces of advertisement…

… You already created a poster, which is good, but come on, you can do better. 

Tell your story, make a video, a copy in addition and show people that it’s real. That your event will happen and that they should be hyped for that. It’s their blood boiling before entering the club that will make the difference.

Create a Facebook event and repost it in every group you can (the groups where people who are susceptible to come are part of).

Ask your friends to share the event. The merrier, the better. And mostly, it will make your event more credible.

Pay some Facebook ads as it’s very effective.

Post on Reddit or any social media that can convert people. 

Sometimes, people are craving for the type of party that you will organize. They might just don’t know that someone is playing around them. So you’re actually helping more than anything else.

7) **Prepare everything**

Normally, working with a bar or a restaurant will avoid all the regulations, all the permits, and so on. You won’t need to think of everything. But still, you should always ask for:

Fire = Normally, the owner has it covered if it’s a legal place. (And this is why it’s easier to choose a bar or a restaurant)

Security = Often, the owner pays someone when they have events. Ask in case.

The noise disturbance = Try to avoid cops coming in the middle of the party to shut down everything. Ask the owner.

Handle cash= Find ways to handle cash and be paid surely. Be able to give recipes too. Find a way to have a simple accounting. Depending on your country, you might not need to start something, but it’s better if you keep track of the future.

The wardrobe= Find someone YOU TRUST for the wardrobe. Ask the owner also. He might already work with people.

Understand the sound system of the place. Be ready for any problem and see if your DJs can plug themselves. Come several times the week before your event to be sure that everything is smooth.

Organize meetings with your crew to be on point = It helps people to structure and speak out on the project. The more you let people show implications, the happier they will be.

Come before and stay after the party. Help to organize the room. You will gain credibility. Be careful, do not do someone else's work.

Be easy to find. Nothing is more frustrating than not finding a party.

PS: here, if you have any other suggestions, I am down for getting them as we are never too careful.

8) **Throw your party, enjoy and repeat**

I applied this strategy when I was studying in Sweden. I started organizing parties from scratch in a country where I couldn’t even pronounce the alphabet. I also didn’t have good DJ skills by the time. I made lots of connections, got crazy memories with a lot of friends, and found my future wife. If it worked for me, it should work for you too.

If you want to know more about party organizing, we are creating content on our website [lesk.club](https://www.lesk.club/), don’t hesitate to check it out. And if you have any feedback, ideas or whatsoever we will be happy.

Other than that, I wish you good luck in your journey for DJing. ",1621536142.0

We hit it off quickly and have been a dynamic duo in many ways since, but although we love all the same kinds of music, she never even considered trying to touch the decks herself for years until the pandemic hit. Now with 0 real creative social outlets, I've been slowly teaching her how to mix over the past several months, and last night we finally got to play in front of a live ""audience"" via a Twitch stream/zoom party to celebrate my birthday. It was only for a relatively small amount of close friends, maybe 20 people at it's peak, but we went for a solid 6 hours straight of proper back to back and she honestly killed it and got a ton of positive feedback from our pals, and now it's looking like we're going to become a DJ duo when we resume throwing events again eventually. Sorry if this post is just a fluffy humblebrag, but we're both still riding the high from having such a lengthy set go off so well and I wanted to share. 10/10 definitely recommend b2b DJ sessions for quality couple's bonding lol.

&#x200B;

\*Random edit 9 months later not that anyone will see it but we have now also gone on to play a weekly residency together for a local bar patio back in the summer time as well as some other decently big gigs like mini fests and a Halloween rave together as a back to back duo. So definitely a real duo now! :)

Trap Hip Hop and she knew I just started DJing EDM. lol. Not at all - I had just bought a controller and watched some online videos for a few weeks. I was clueless and has never practiced for more than an hour doing transitions. 

So here she goes, “Can you please play some EDM, please?” Right after her best friend came to me and said “she really doesn’t like this...” 

Ok - Tomorrowland 1000 playlist - pick a banger here we go - find the next song in key and similar BMP - MOST IMPORTANT PART - know where need to start the song - the energy is never on the one and sometimes not even close to the beginning - “find where the energy of the song starts!!!” - cued it up - missed the transition - cued back, faded in at that point - right away with energy! 

After missing all my initial transition attempts and resorting to fading - I said to myself “you can’t do this - you have no practice - it’s live and people are dancing - any mistake will kill the vibe. Just keep finding those energy points, where a strong rhythmic vocal comes in or the build begins or a vocal break in the build or an acapella section right before the next drop if the songs are similar for example and fade in right there! Just keep them moving!” 

Bam - 3 hours later - I felt defeated as a DJ - everyone congratulated me on an “epic night”. At which point I revealed: “guys, I didn’t do a single transition - just played song after song”, with a sad face. 

“Well you played what we liked and it was a blast”. Then the compliments kept coming, this song that song was awesome. You’re sooo good. 

Not sure most people know the difference between a technical transition and one that is faded fast from energy to energy. 

I was shitting myself, for three hours I thought I was looked at like: look at this amateur, but we’re dancing. Meanwhile to them my “transition were great!!!” LMAO

Late 90's or early 00's.

Some friends were having a house party, I'd never been to their house but knew the neighborhood was pretty sketchy. They called me up and asked if I wanted to come down and spin some records.....and could I bring decks. I said sure WTF, they were cool guys, so I packed my stuff and headed out with a roommate in tow. Got setup in the basement at this huge old house and it was going great, sound system was decent and the party was popping. I was spinning booty/ghetto house and everyone was loving it. After maybe 20 minutes we all hear a big crashing sound coming from upstairs over the fairly loud music, everyone stopped and looked up towards the ceiling like ""WTF was that!"" Moments later someone runs down the stairs and says some gang banger type dudes pushed their way into the party.

The music is still playing and up walks this dude who was clearly not one of our crew. It's immediately clear that he may have never seen 1200's IRL before, he also seemed to enjoy the ghetto house I was playing. Dude looked fascinated. I was still actively DJing, trying to ignore this dude and not interact. He walks right up and makes his best attempt at scratching on the currently playing record from the crowd side of the DJ booth (I use the term very loosely) and I absolutely fucking let him. I had zero ideas about doing anything to stop this from happening, but after maybe 10 seconds of him moving the record back and forth he gave me a stone cold look....and walked away. 1 or 2 minutes later someone says to me ""they're robbing people upstairs, take your decks and get the fuck out of here."". Now everyone in the basement is like starting to panic a bit and frankly so was I, cuz it seemed like we were trapped. Thankfully some calm headed raver notes there is a door with stairs leading to the garage. It felt like a miracle, everyone *in the basement* was able to escape including me, my roommate and my gear. Unfortunately a few of my friends upstairs did get robbed and sucker punched, but otherwise were okay.

Well, I wowed the owners by mixing it up for some Indian clients who snagged their party room. They were all, “We need this DJ for NYE and every Saturday after that!”

But hold your applause because here’s where the plot twist kicks in. A few days prior, I’m all proactive, asking about the vibe they want. They throw me a mixtape request: house, a sprinkle of Arabic tunes, and that thumping EDM for the big NYE bash. Sweet deal, right? Armed with Arabic hits, owner-approved tracks, and a stash of party bangers, I’m thinking, “Easy peasy, this gig’s a breeze.”

Fast forward to showtime. Nine o’clock hits, and it’s a ghost town—no surprises there. So, I’m in my element, dropping house beats, spicing it up with Drake and Pitbull. And then, out of the blue, the owner’s missus drops the bomb: “Only Arabic songs from now on.” Talk about a plot twist!

Now, the plot thickens. I’m there, spinning beats and sprinkling in some killer house remixes of Arabic tracks I dug up. Surprise, surprise—it turns out it’s Lebanese, not your standard Arabic fare. How could I tell? Well, newsflash: I’m not exactly from that neck of the woods. I’m a black Asian guy who, on occasion, gets mistaken for someone from the Middle East. And hey, I’m pretty sure that’s why I snagged this gig in the first place!

But wait, there’s more awkwardness on the horizon. The owner throws a curveball and introduces me to their son, who’s itching to hop on the decks. He had to be about 10-12 in age. My initial thought? “Cool, I’ll school the lad a bit. Keep the kid happy, keep the clients happy—simple, right?” Wrong. This mini-DJ maestro makes a beeline for the turntable while the music’s pumping and decides it’s knob-touching time. Cue the music halt, effects gone rogue, and a sea of eyes staring straight at me. What do I do? I crack up. I surrender, hit the air horn sound effect (because why not?), throw on another house track, and BAM! I get chewed out because apparently, DJ Khaled doesn’t pass for “Arabic” in this scenario. Go figure.

But here’s the kicker: a squad of 15 college white kids—my saving grace. No dance floor in sight, just tables and hookah everywhere. So, what do I do? I work my magic, drop some sick house beats, and guess what? Those kids start grooving. Picture this: chairs become impromptu dance stages, folks shimmying around tables with hookahs in tow. Who needs a dance floor when you’ve got a crowd turning their seats into boogie zones?

Alright, buckle up for the whirlwind: I scan the room, and about 15 to 20 folks are sporting the classic stank face. Seems they’re on a strict “Arabic music only” diet. So, I reluctantly transform into a human playlist, just hitting play on the owner’s 30-minute Arabic song collection. I’ve got a 5-hour gig ahead of me… oh boy.

Plot twist! As I dive into the Arabic playlist, a wild card appears—a belly dancer takes the stage. Jackpot, right? I focus on her, hoping for a distraction. But guess what? She sashays over and requests more Arabic tunes. I panic—I’m tapped out on my Arabic stash. Turns out, she’s not even Arabic herself; she’s Puerto Rican. Go figure! We share a laugh about the confusion. Then she drops the bomb: the music I played before was 🔥. Sadly, the truth stings—everyone else here only wants Arabic beats, confirmed by the belly dancer.

Meanwhile, just a week earlier, the owners clearly (and I mean, in text message clarity) told me to switch it up between Arabic and American tunes. Well, guess that memo got lost in translation.

So, here’s the cherry on top of this madness cake: the owner’s mini-me decides it’s prime time to turn my DJ booth into a theme park. Picture this: I’m in the zone, trying to craft sonic miracles, when suddenly, I feel this incessant tapping on my shoulder. Who’s the culprit? The owner’s kid. And what does this tyke want? Sigma music and Eminem. Because, sure, why not turn the DJ booth into a jukebox, right?

But wait, there’s more! This kid doesn’t stop there. Oh no, he bolts off, only to return wielding a laptop like it’s Excalibur. He plonks it down next to my DJ setup, desperate to flaunt his Fortnite skin collection. I’m thinking, “Is this a DJ set or a tech demo for Fortnite cosplay?”

I’m over here, trying to mix tracks for dear life, and suddenly I’ve got a DJ battle with an eager Fortnite warrior. Reality check: this can’t possibly be happening, but oh yes, it is.

Ah, the perfect storm meets an unexpected reunion! Picture this: my high school buddies, long lost in the sands of time, suddenly emerge at the hookah bar Armageddon. Shots are flying, jokes are crackling over the mic, and we’re there, conducting the countdown like it’s our own private New Year’s Eve shindig. Cheers to the new year, right?

Now, let’s address the elephant in the DJ booth—the gig was a glorious train wreck. But hey, silver lining alert: I pocketed the full payment and a hefty $20 tip. Plus, amidst the chaos, I managed to crack some jokes, entertain a few souls, and even got folks chuckling at my “acceptance of defeat” dance.

Here’s the kicker: I’m telling myself, “Hey, it wasn’t all that bad!” Why? Because at some point, I had every soul in that room grooving. Picture this scene: no dance floor in sight, just tables, chairs, and a bunch of merry souls jiving awkwardly beside their seats.

But hold on to your hats, folks, ‘cause the night ain’t over till it’s over. As the curtains close, I catch a glimpse of the owner’s face. And oh boy, it’s not a pretty sight. She drops the bomb: “You need more practice with Arabic music.”

Plot twist: I’m not Arabic… Yep, that’s the finale to my epic, if not slightly bewildering, hookah bar debut!

Granted I did try to do my research with the music. I had about 100 tracks, overkill I thought. I had no idea some of the tracks wasn’t Arabic. Oh well. 

Any tips on how to get over train wreck gigs are much appreciated. Happy new year everyone! #2024",1704101538.0

If you have been a DJ for a while, you totally know how the sounds and vibes have changed. I've been clubbing since 1992, and DJing since 94. I love to get into the history of club music, and find forgotten dancefloor bangers from the 70s and 80s to bring back from the dead. One of my favorite tools for this is The Disco Preservation Society which remasters and digitizes dats and tapes from decades past. Not only is it just a fun way to listen to music, it is also interesting to hear how the best DJs mixed in the 70s and 80s, prior to modern hardware.  

It is a bit counterintuitive to navigate (Protip, click the recent mixtapes tab and then click on the user tag) , so here are direct links to each decade:

* [70s Mixes](https://hearthis.at/sfdps/)
* [80s Mixes](https://hearthis.at/eightiesdarchives/)
* [90s Mixes](https://hearthis.at/ninetiesdjarchives/)
* [2000s Mixes](https://hearthis.at/twothousandsdjarchives-oo/) (Just saw they have teens and twenties included with the aughts now, so I guess we are at six decades.)

Hope you enjoy, and please share any good mixes you discover in the comments, I've hardly scratched the surface over the last two years.",1655065864.0

I started out on vinyl back in the late 90's.  I've always just played for fun, participating in events my friends have put on.  I got known for being a good Opener/Warmup DJ and good for the Closing set, as well as for Downtempo rooms.  

On Halloween, some friends and I were putting on a rager and when laying out the lineup there was a slot between 12:30-1:45 and they suggested I do it.  I was so nervous, but I went for it.  It was a huge success and I'm so glad to be over that hump!

So, to all you DJ's who see yourself getting pigeon-holed.  Remember to be patient... to be cool... don't be pushy or arrogant.  Do it because you love it and eventually (and hopefully sooner than it happened for me) you'll be playing the set times you want to.  ",1509640842.0

Something I haven’t done in over a decade. I was stepping into help out at the kids school. Their annual Halloween disco - a fundraiser for the school…

Two sets. One for years 1, 2 &3. The other for 4,5 and 6. Reader - there was a lot of pressure. Fun pressure, but there was work afoot. First of all. What songs - I didn’t want it to be the best of Disney , because well that’s not really a dance. And then I had to check the lyrics so there was no obvious f n jeffing etc. So songs were assessed by the kid and wife: and a playlist was formed. Songs were sourced, apps dabbled with and we were sorted. 

Had to help set up. I took a few extra lights, speakers were there. How hard could be… I had an hour to set up…

Well. I was there early - you could hear all the kids excited as they headed home, knowing in an hour it was the social event of the season. The game was afoot. 

Let’s get set up. So first of all. No tables to set up on, but the appeared. Had access to the PA box but the in house speakers we were going to use didnt work. Well one didnt. So a gig with one speaker is no joy. So off to find the other ones. The music room key was found. Got the speakers, cables and the lights. Clocks ticking but doing ok. Untangling the cables. Finally got plugged in. But not very loud. Much fiddling with the mixer and noise could be heard. 

Time before the kids arrived. 15 mins. 

You could hear them lining up. Lights were flashing, blinds closed. It was looking good. Then the fear kicks in. Did I pick good stuff, the other guy who has done it has been for years at the school. I’m this blow in and I don’t want to be crap especially so I don’t embarrass my kid! 

The doors open and my god there is something joyous and fun of 150 ish kids under 8 in full fancy dress hearing loud music. The screeching, the dancing, the running about - the pure fascination of looking at the lights. Started with The Weeknd, Miley Cyrus and lots of pop. And they were having a blast. Bit of Spooky Scary Skeletons and Ghostbuster. The kid was very happy! 

Now for these younger kids - they get a sweetie goodybag as part of their ticket. So when the shutters went up to the tuck shop, 300 eyes lit up. No to manage the barrage - I had to ask the crowd to go up by class. Amazingly. They did. Kids were so polite and then they all sat around the edge in the hall eating Haribo / flying saucers. So I knew I had 5 ish quiet mins before the sugar hit. At that point we had about 25 ish mins until the end. So started with Firework, and they were all singing and dancing. So thought.. let’s amp this up. Darude

Sandstorm was out many years before these nippers were a sparkle in their parents eyes. But my god it still has such a reaction. The parents and teachers helping out were also giving it the full beans. Hmmmmm. Next. Out of space. Granted I did this for my kid especially but OH MY DAYS. What a reaction - my wife is in the queue outside for collection txting me “the crowd out here are loving it as well”. Clock is ticking need something moderate and mix into Babyshark. Lads it felt like an illicit rave. Kids were having a blast but we started the end of the night and by the time the lights came on we were all done. 

The noise finally left the room. Wow. Loud. Was just an understatement. 15 mins then the real challenge came on. The older kids. This would be harder. They knew what they wanted. They had been going to this event for years. Regular crowds don’t always like change. 

“One more time” is playing as they rush in - and again within 10 mins 150 customers are filling the floor. Boys are trying the breakdance, girls dancing in a circle. It’s a tale as old as time. 

“Move your feet” still works, nice groove going. The teachers and supervisors are all having a bop. Dig for a little Dee Lite. Groove intensifies. Dua Lipa and then some Swift - all gravy. 

Then the requests come in… “can you play sweet Caroline?”

Reader… now it caught me off guard. Wasn’t expecting this. But then 2 others asked. So… transition with a bit of Freed from Desire and the dropped the Diamond. Boom Shaka lack. 

Never have I heard anything as loud or as passionate as all those kids singing with gusto and raising the roof off the place. Did the old kill the track trick off and they didn’t need any accompaniment. A turning point. The chat from the kids had moved from “is the usual dj not doing it” with a sad face to … “any chance you can play…”

We will Rock you? Sure why not. Smells like teen spirit. Errrr I’d love to but not on my first time here. But then a real wild card….. One boy. Polite, stylish outfit and obviously well educated. “Can you play … never gonna give you up?”

They wanted Rick Astley

Reader. I’ve played lots of places, to many people. Never have I seen such a wonderful reaction to the opening bars of this song. Everyone sang. Everyone danced. The head teacher was having the time of their life. Pure joy. 

One kid tried to get me to play some metal and even tried to bribe me with some Maom from the tuck shop. Sorry sir but I can’t be bought. 

The night finished with ghostbusters and then lights on and done. I was shattered but it was one of the best gigs I have ever done. 

Up there with Schooldisco / Frenzy and the Keller nights.

Kids discos don’t have to be all Disney / cover versions. There was no need to be cool - just good music for people to dance too. Love it. Will I do it again. Absolutely. Great to fall in love with an old hobby again.

Hue Sync - Free  
If you have Philips Hue lights you can use Music Mode to make your lights pulse with the music, you can set different colour schemes and the intensity of the light show.

Winamp - Free  
You can play linein:// and open up the visualiser to capture in OBS, you can also download visualisation plugins for more variety.  
[https://winamp.com/](https://winamp.com/)  


Electric Sheep - Free version  
This is a screensaver that generates amazing looking trippy visuals but they don't react to music. The free version they allow you to use on your live stream but they ask for you to credit the artist and have link to the electric sheep website.  
[https://electricsheep.org/](https://electricsheep.org/)  


Synesthesia - Free demo - $99 for standard version  
I've only tried out the demo, there is a slight learning curve to this software. This is VJ software that allows you to mix your own videos, images, live camera with heaps of different visuals. You can put them in a playlist and it will play them automatically. There's no option to shuffle the playlist so they'll always be in the same order.  
[https://synesthesia.live/](https://synesthesia.live/)  


Visualz - Free (non-commercial) - $40 yearly (commerical)  
This is a wacky piece of VJ software that essentially allows you to search for GIFs, create a playlist full of gifs and your own images and videos. You can add visual effects to the gifs, videos, images that respond to music, set how frequently the scene changes based how many beats have been played. You can have also have the playlist play automatically but like Synesthesia it will play in order with no random function.

At it seems a lot of you enjoyed my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ampl9g/for_djs_who_like_to_dig_through_spotify_for_new/) a few months ago, I've recreated (partially) my most popular techno, house and electro Spotify playlists in YouTube and Soundcloud using soundsgood.co to make it as painless as possible.

These playlists are kept in sync daily with any new music added through Spotify, provided that the music exists on either platform and if the app is able to find it.

Unfortunately some of the playlists are a little short compared to what's on Spotify, but they should develop over time.

All links can be found below, the rest are [on my website](https://www.adam-heaton.co.uk/spotify-playlists/). Hope these are useful to some of you!

862,Absolutely Humbled by 2000s,142,16olxso,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/16olxso/absolutely_humbled_by_2000s/,136,"Reasonably well known local DJ in my area (Perth, Aus) for House and Techno. 
Have been mixing for 5 years, playing clubs for 4, started a minimal / deep tech event label 2years ago and have played easily over 100 slots including a few really solid international supports.
220+ mixes online and still mix at home at least once or twice a week for gig prep or giggles..
Nothing special, but I like to think I know what I'm doing. 
Last Sunday however, I did not.

So I'm booked to close the outdoor stage for the Perth leg of T78's Australia run, Techno inside, ""Tech House"" outside.
I already knew the outdoor stage was running a DJM800 & CD2000s, and for most of the night the stage was dead (3-10 people at a time), so I wasn't stressing at all. The strobes inside where stressin' my epilepsy out so I hung out with some of the other DJs in the green room and went to watch the sets outside until it was time to play..

As I'm admiring the vinyl mixing skills of the DJ before me, the dancelfloor suddenly started filling and very quickly. By the time he had to hand over the dancefloor was packed so I stepped and had the sudden realisation, 2000s don't have live waveforms or phase meters.. I've had plenty of live trainwrecks in my time but never in a set have I had to borderline ""filter out"" a track because I'd lost it more than once.. This time I went for the hat-trick with 3 absolutely heinous trainwrecks, not to a point of ""complete loss of vibe"" but definitely those ones where you know that every other DJ in the room is asking themselves if you need them to take over.. 

Managed to pull it together through a solid selection of closing tracks and held the floor all the way till close, big claps n all the rest but it had fully rattled me. Said my goodbyes and got out of there. Managed to get a couple of promo clips from the recording but I think I'll leave this set in the ""unlisted"" section.

I never used sync when I'm playing but I did learn to DJ on a Traktor controller before moving to a RX2 then a DJM800 & 2000nxs', all with live waveforms and and phase meters.
I haven't had to beatmatch completely by ear since a series of bar gigs over a year ago that were running 900s and I guess I had gotten complacent. 2023 has been a massive year for me as a DJ and for my brand but this was one of moments that really puts you back in your place. It's kinda just been sitting with me since, been playing with paper over the decks to force my ear back into doing the work.. 
Having all the bells and whistles makes life alot easier surebut as a promoter with 9 of my own residents, I need to know that my DJs, and therefore me included, can play on a wide range of equipment and aren't going to be stumped in these moments.

TLDR: Trainwrecked my way through a closing set on older equipment and Houdini'd out of the venue into an Uber post-haste to go home and relearn how to actually DJ",1695317690.0
863,Hard Work Paying Off!!!,141,x4kt0v,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/x4kt0v/hard_work_paying_off/,47,"I don’t really belong to a tight community of DJs and most of my friends just don’t understand, but I just had to announce it:

I got my first club residency!!!!! I’ve only been DJing for 6 months, but I’ve put a massive amount of work into it. From website, to promotion, to skill training, to audio efficiency. I dove in 110% and made my success at this DJing thing my main focus. 

I don’t say this to brag, but I’m epically proud of myself. There are a few caveats. This “club” is an outdoor beach volley ball brewery. I’ve been playing on a team for the summer and just noticed the tunes were shit. So, I asked to talk to the owner one night and asked if they’d ever thought of bringing a DJ on to build business. I got all the excuses: 

Them: They are all unprofessional, unreliable, flaky, and they damaged our audio equipment. 

Me: I am none of those things. Got my own speaks, woofs, and lights. I’ll damage my own stuff!

Them: Are you good? I mean, do you understand how to adapt to diverse crowds?

Me: Yes, from windows to walls….I got you covered. 

Them:What’s your fee?

Me: First Friday is on me. I’ll drop a banger of a party. Then we’ll talk money.

Them: Why would I say “no”?

I only share this to encourage all the starters and self-doubters. There are tons of opportunities out there, but they aren’t going to come to you. Be your biggest fan! Believe in yourself! Your talent will take you places!",1662177066.0

866,This had to be the least prepared opening act I have ever seen. Whats the worst one you've ever seen?,143,6yzx35,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/6yzx35/this_had_to_be_the_least_prepared_opening_act_i/,64,"This happened tonight and I wanted to tell this story. It's a bit of a long read but I didn't want to leave out any of the details.  I wish I had made this up.

I've been playing for a long time.  I never really took off beyond local shows but I used to play house at most of the clubs around here.  I took a few years off to work on a new business and recently started playing shows again.

Tonight I'm booked to headline a local show.  I stopped by before the show started to see what the set up was like so I would know what to expect.  Just a basic set up with two CDJ 2000s and a 2000 mixer.  About 10 minutes before doors, I was ready to head back home when I see a panicked couple run up to me asking where to find the promoter.  They were the opening act.  

They had a laptop with Serato on it and tried to plug it into one of the CDJs with a dual sided USB cable.  They couldn't figure out why it wasn't working.  They then tried to plug a hard drive into the CDJ and it wasn't working.  I asked them if they had rekord box and they asked ""what is rekord box?""  I explained what it was and she then was going to try to download it onto their laptop so they could get a set list together.  It was 2 minutes to doors.  

I went and grabbed my laptop and handed it to them so they could copy their tracks onto my laptop and then put them onto a drive with rekordbox.  People were starting to come into the venue so I  threw my flash drive in and started to play some tracks.  I look over at this couple and they finally got their tracks onto my laptop.  They then pulled up their laptop and were setting up their cue points identical to their Serato cue points because in her words ""we can't mix without them.""  

Thirty minutes later they are still working on their ""set"" on my laptop.  There were about 40 people in the show now.  Finally she says ""we are almost ready can you show me how to use this mixer"".  She then asks where the headphone jack plugs in.  Its a 2000 mixer...  She plugs in her headphones, I show her which button to push so she can hear the headphones and then her headphone cord falls out of the jack.  She doesn't have a 1/4 inch and had just tried to plug her 3.5 mm into the headphone jack.  I tell her that she need a 1/4 inch adapter and she goes ""what is a 1/4 inch adapter?""  

At this point I'm getting pretty frustrated as there are more people coming into the venue.  Another DJ that has been at it for years and is playing later in the night comes up and I tell him that he can jump in as I was only playing because it would have been dead air otherwise.  He mixes out of my track and the couple is now trying to figure out how to plug their hard drive into the cdj.  Its not reading for them.  The DJ that is now playing gives them a flash drive and I up my laptop again so they can put their play list onto the flash drive.  As soon as its done exporting, I close my laptop and start walking for the door.  She comes running up to me screaming ""ITS NOT WORKING"".  I walk back up to the decks to see why it isn't reading, she is still holding the flash drive in her hand and hadn't actually plugged it in. 

The other DJ shows her how to plug in the flash drive and select USB.  They have about 15 minutes left in their set.  They push stop on the track playing and everyone stops dancing and just looks at them.  They then push play on their flash drive, their first track starts and exactly at the same time, they both put their hands in the air to what looks like a choreographed dance routine.  I watched them play for their 15 minutes and they screwed up every mix so bad that people stopped dancing at every transtition.  However, during every track at a certain point they would both throw their hands into the air at the same time and start dancing together because they had actually practiced that part.  

I took off to go get some food and am tying this up while I'm eating at Betos.  

I get first show jitters but if you don't know what rekordbox is, you don't know what a 1/4 inch adapter is and you don't know how to plug a flash drive into a cdj, mayber you aren't quite ready to be playing at a show people are paying to go to.  They obviously had spent time practicing their dance moves together but had no idea how to actually mix without trying to pre-program everything?  They would rather give up their stage time to make sure their cue points were set, instead of playing music for people?  Thats not DJ'ing.  

The promoter is a good guy.  They assured him that they knew what they were doing and had done this before.  I've got to go back in about an hour to finish out the night.  

So lets hear your least prepared DJ stories.

877,Life Lessons from DJs,141,nlrik0,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/nlrik0/life_lessons_from_djs/,32,"Hey fellow DJs,

I wanted to derive some life lessons from the art of DJing. Let me know if you agree or can think of other life lessons :)

1. **Do the necessary prep work and have a solid plan, but leave room for spontaneity.** If you’re giving a presentation or planning a family vacation, there are the types that will prepare every single detail while others wing it. Be prepared with the outline and important details but leaving some room for spontaneity because often that is where the magic happens. 
2. **Innovation mostly happens through incremental improvements and risk taking.** There are actually very few original ideas in our world, and that’s okay. Most DJs are playing other people’s music old and new, but the good ones chop it up, combine them with other songs, remove some elements of a song and highlight others. It’s okay to borrow ideas and content (legally) and add your own “spin” on it. These incremental ideas no matter how minute or trivial may spark inspiration in your audience so share them. 
3. **It is important to play.** You’ve seen performers young and old. They are incorporating play and movement into their life. Be vulnerable, be silly, share joy around you when you can and are able, and most importantly, incorporate some play into your routine.
4. **You’re going to make mistakes, deal with it.** You can plan the perfect set, the perfect speech, the perfect plans, and something is bound to go wrong, big or small. During my first public DJ set, I accidentally hit the pause/play button with my wrist during exuberant motion. Silence. Silence is the cardinal sin of being a good DJ. Not everyone is going to notice your mistakes or remember them, so laugh it off, learn, and move on. If you’re not making mistakes, you’re not pushing yourself or learning. 
5. **Do things for yourself, but also do it for others.** Creating positive experiences for others feels good. It gives purpose, no matter how small the gesture or impact it has on this world. It’s easy to get caught up in our own thoughts and egos. ",1622063166.0

I had the thought to start carrying around a USB of music and headphones out to parties/ events. 
Twice I have been asked if I want to play when I wasn't even booked or just came to dance and party. 

This has generated me much more big opportunities, since having those moments to showcase my music and talent, has resulted in more interest in booking me. I used to do 10 PM slots where barely anyone has shown up yet, and now I convinced the booking manager to move me to a later slot and may even open before the headliner. 

As many say, go out, be social in your local community, talk to the show runners, and eventually things will work out if you got the skill.

Edit: Since some of you mentioned not wanting to be ""that annoying guy that hopes to hop in"" I want to point out that I didn't hang around the booth and bug any DJs.

**Native Instruments just fired about 100 people.**

**BACKGROUND**

You guys may remember the long investigation I did of Native Instruments a few months ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/NativeInstruments/comments/carm7f/financial_analysis_of_native_instruments_xpost/

That was based on financial statements up to 2017. I ended the post with these words:

> If [the changes made in 2018] changes didn’t perform as well as hoped then 2019 will be a bad year. Whoever in management was behind the plans from 2017/2018 will have a lot of explaining to do and new strategies will have to be developed. We’ve been hearing reports of entire teams being fired in 2019 and the Glassdoor reviews are terrible. If those indicators are to be believed, then 2018 might not have worked out as planned and now the holding company and the management are trying to course correct. This could also include things like mergers, acquisitions, or sale of all or part of the company in more dire circumstances.

Well, an article just broke that was nothing but a rehash of my original post (it’s garbage, you can skip it), but what *is* interesting is a comment in its comment sections, from Sept 2 (today):

> “100 peeps fired in Berlin, almost all hardware teams are fired. Maschine stand-alone was cancelled on the first day of mass production.”

https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/09/01/native-instruments-layoffs/ 

That got me digging further and I found this thread on the NI forums discussing my post, which I had somehow missed over the summer. 

https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/current-state-of-ni-interesting-thread-on-reddit.358871/page-5

It includes a discussion of all the layoffs yesterday, in particular the following bombshell:

- **The Maschine *and* Traktor product owners were just laid off**

This came from a Google doc floating around Twitter with all list of all people looking for work now. Here’s the Gdoc, which has unfortunately since been deleted:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ExvH5Nut_5xsyV-Uwohk-C7UupT5AcpG6T2vaUxo1eo/htmlview#gid=0

A Twitter comment with one of the lead devs who got laid off clarified these are lay-offs, not entire division closures, but still about 100 people seem to have been fired. 

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?**

It’s hard to speculate until more information comes out (which will be soon, no doubt), but it looks like my 2018 scenario was sadly accurate. 

My guess is that the big moves made in 2017 didn’t work out as intended from a financial perspective and now the axe is falling. 

This **does not mean** NI is going out of business, your products will stop working, or that nothing new will be coming out. As my analysis shows, they’ve still got a decent bank account and a profitable business, even if it’s a strategic mess and has been behind the curve on innovation in recent years. 

What it **might mean** is that the new financial bosses are turning the screws hard, probably with an eye towards eventual sale to a large group like InMusic. But *this is pure speculation* until we learn more. 

Bottom line, this is really sad news for all those involved. I hope they find awesome jobs elsewhere and continue to make our musical lives better with even better software and hardware products.

923,PSA: mixing vinyl and mental health,136,p7v7au,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/p7v7au/psa_mixing_vinyl_and_mental_health/,27,"Goes without saying that the last 18 months have been very hard on… everyone. I’m sure I don’t need to go into why. But in these circumstances, mental health is something we all need to consciously work at. I’m just here to share a few thoughts on why mixing vinyl is particularly good for you.

First, let’s talk about **flow.** This is an experience state you can have on any thoroughly engaging activity, which is in the sweet spot between too easy - and your attention wanders off - and too hard – where the frustration may drop you out. It can be a place where your internal monologue is quietened as your full attention engages in your thought processes. You are in the zone, fully immersed and time flies by without noticing. Many things can provide flow – programming, spinning tunes, studying, really immersive gaming.

Now let’s add to that one more concept: **language processing**. Language processing is an innate cognitive process that happens every time you do things around language. Which is almost all the time. So reading and writing emails, researching a term paper, organising and crunching analysis in a spreadsheet, being in meetings, almost all aspects of daily work life involve your verbal processing. And this includes searching for or reading off the names of tunes in your rekordbox collection, and even reading off the countdown timer on your CDJ LCD screen taps it too.

The secret sauce of vinyl mixing is that it is much better for enabling a **flow state** with a much much **lower language processing load**. Mixing records, compared to most digital setups, takes most or all of the verbal processing away. All beatmatching needs to be done by ear, no sync button or reading off BPMs - just sliding that pitch control around. Deciding when to mix in the next tune is based on your internal memory of the tune structure, plus of course just visually looking at where the needle is at. Tune selection from your record bag is much more visual that language based as well: when you know your record sleeves and labels you’re really recalling what to flip through and reach for by recognizing colours and shapes, nothing as verbally involved as a scrolling a glowing rekordbox library screen on a laptop.

My experience of good long stretches of **flow state, non-verbal processing, vinyl DJing time** is that it is intensely relaxing, and the benefits last for days. I first observed this maybe 10 years ago when I was doing a half dozen gigs a month, often 4-5 hour long sets. The gigs that I only brought vinyl, I could really feel a difference in the \*kind\* of effort going on and the mental fatigue at the end of a long night. I would have drawn very little on the already-tired language processing centres that are involved in my long-hours day job, and instead I’ve flexed hard some other parts of the brain instead. (And they are literally other parts of the brain). And the next day or back at work on the Monday I felt like I’d had much more of an excursion away from the regular tasks of the day job: emails, emails, meetings, spreadsheets, and so on. And was much more refreshed for it.

TLDR: Mixing tunes is always good for you. And... I humbly submit that mixing tunes on vinyl is *really, uniquely* good for you, in a way that digital DJing cannot fully replicate. So if your spouse raises their eyebrows at your next wax shipment, just remember this post and reassure them you’re making an investment in your mental health.

TLDR TLDR:

For your brain, your whole damn life is arm day

Mixing vinyl is leg day

I'd planned mine out on the back deck early in the afternoon-early evening so we could play nice music in the sun and watch the sun set and also bc considerate to neighbours later in the night and move the music inside, a couple of my mates had started coming around (we are allowed to have 15 people with restrictions) and there were about 3 of us enjoying the nice weather at 3:30pm in the afternoon when the police come around the side and ask us to turn the music off as one of the neighbours have made a noise complaint. We were not playing anything heavy or anything offensive, just some laid back house music to enjoy some drinks with mates to see out this year. It was going to be the closest thing to going out and dancing with other people we've had in a long time. It's bad enough that it feels like we're stuck in our houses all the time but it truly feels horrible with the feeling that I can't play music outside in the sun without it being illegal unless you go to a remote location. I'd give anything to be partying and dancing to loud music with lovely people that appreciate music

TLDR: restrictions being tightened with 5 hours notice when parties had already been planned, wanted to enjoy some nice music on the back deck during the day in the nice weather so we could turn it off later at night for the neighbours and at 3:30pm we had police show up with a noise complaint",1609542909.0

I actually posted on here about a year ago regarding possibly being an opener for Malaa. I had so much great feedback then but one thing that stuck out to me was that…if I thought I was ready, I probably wasn’t and that I should take a little more time to fine tune my craft. One year later I finally decided to go for it. Yesterday I played my first club gig as one of the openers for Kaskade. And HOLY SHIT lol I’m still riding that high today. It felt surreal to step into that DJ booth, touching CDJ 3000s which until now I’ve only ever seen on YouTube. The powerful bass of the club speakers gave me goosebumps. The lighting and visuals that accompanied my set, was literally shit I’ve daydreamed about. And when I played one of my all time favorite tracks “All You Need Is Love” by Avicii, I was ready to cry tears of joy lol. 

I went into this planning to do this as a one time bucket list type thing, but I want to feel all that again. I’m addicted. I’ve never played for maybe more than 10 people and last night I prob played for 100. That’s wild to me.

Honestly, I’m not sure why I felt like sharing all this. Maybe it’s to encourage other bedroom DJs to just fucking go for it! Breakout of your comfort zone. You won’t regret it.

***Update: guess it would be important to add some details on how I even got the gig. I do want to clarify that I was one of 3 openers for Kaskade lol and I definitely wasn’t the one right before him either. 

It’s pretty simple really, a club promoter who also handles the opening talent asked my friend if he knew any DJs as they’re always looking for opening talent. I reached out to the promoter and he asked for a 30 minute sample mix. From there he just told me to text him for any upcoming shows that I might be interested in. Of course there’s a lot of promoting that goes into it, it’s essentially pay to play. You’re required to sell a certain amount of tickets. I feel like there is a lot mixed feelings about this but for me I thought it was fair. I’m a nobody with no experience lol what does the club gain by letting you play. So I get it. Selling the tickets is the hardest part haha. But you do get paid. Eventually when you’ve built yourself up you can reach the slot right before the headliner and then you’re not required to sell tickets anymore. Once I decided on the show I had a logo and visuals made on Fiverr. Easy peasy lol.",1664740597.0

I know we've all had this problem where folks are hovering at the DJ booth to try and tell you their request. I've solved this by using a custom QR code for each event. You can direct people to scan the QR code with their phone rather than bug you. The process is super easy, and the audience gets feedback that their request is in the system.

2 The requests never work in your set

Once the requests come to you, it's hard to keep track of the songs and know which ones you could play next. I've solved this problem by introducing a way to filter songs by bpm and artist, and to hide requests you've already played. Additionally, you can sort requests by the amount of times a song has been requested. It only works with tracks in my database, but I've been adding more and more songs.

I taught myself how to make websites because I had some inspiration when I was the president of my Uni's DJ club. I finally feel comfortable sharing my work with y'all. It has seen some use at gigs already from a brave tester, and I'm stoked to see if I can help more people. Check it out here: https://playitfor.me/

Best part is, it’s FREE! I show an ad after the request has been made to try and cover hosting for now. If there is interest I’m going to add a premium tier with more features for a small monthly fee. Please feel free to AMA!",1620077697.0

941,The crazy lucky story of how I landed a residency at a popular club in my city,136,b2yabq,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/b2yabq/the_crazy_lucky_story_of_how_i_landed_a_residency/,27,"To preface this, this club is a very popular club with a dope rooftop in the summer time in my city. They play hip-hop and a range of house every night. More house or hip hop, depending on the DJ, but they lean house most nights because they don’t want a too “ghetto” vibe (managers words). One DJ runs a four hour set 10-2, with no other DJs in the house unless he brought a friend to tag team. Admittedly, they don’t promote the DJ or really go after “talent.” The DJs are mainly guys from the club manager’s inner circle, although they are quite good in my opinion and have years of experience. On to the story.

 

At the time, I had been bedroom DJing for almost two years. I put out mixes regularly and DJd as many house parties as I possibly could. I DJd my buddies charity event at the Restaurant and Bar he owns and even a yoga class at the studio my girlfriend at the time taught at. I was hungry to play out and was doing so basically anywhere that would let me.

 

It was my birthday back in 2014 and we had decided to get a booth and bottles at the aforementioned club for the night. Mid-twenties at the time and any excuse to party worked for us. So we pre-gamed at my place and the twenty or so of us headed to the club.

 

I get to the club feeling good, buzzed but not smashed. Loose. The manager takes us to our table up on the rooftop, its right next to the DJ booth. After some years in the game I know this is cringe but I couldn’t help myself at the time. After settling in at the table and making a drink, I get up and hop up in the DJ booth to “talk shop” with the DJ. Ask him what software he’s using, how long he’s been spinning, and some other bullshit. He’s nice and cordial and answers my questions with a smile but within 30 seconds the big ol bouncer that was in the corner tells me I gotta get out the booth. No problem. I jump down and carry on partying.

 

Maybe on hour goes by, I’m not exactly sure. I’m having a blast with my friends (and a few more drinks). I’m feeling really good at this point. All of a sudden the bouncer that kicked me out earlier appears in front of me with the club manager. I’m a bit startled and immediately think I’m getting kicked out, though I’m not sure why.

 

The club manager asks if I DJ. I have no idea what he’s talking about. I reply with a confused “what?” He repeats himself and tells me look at the DJ booth. The DJ booth is perpendicular to our table so I can see inside. The DJ is literally slouched in the booth unable to stand up. The dude drank too much. The manager asks me again if I can actually DJ because the bouncer overhead our conversation. I say yeah sure, I DJ (not telling him never in the club). He tells me that he’ll pay me if I can fill in the rest of the night…..

 

Normally I’d be too nervous not knowing this guy’s library, equipment, and being so on the spot. But I was lit up at this point and said fuck it. I jump into the booth. He’s running Serato on a Pioneer controller. I run Traktor. But Serato is barebones enough that I can run it. This guy had put on a 15 minute prerecorded mix. I wonder how often he did that…..but it’s great news for me. I take the time to familiarize myself with the basics of his set up and library and then mix in. For the next hour or hour and half until close, I can’t really remember how long or when I got on, I DJ’d on this guy’s set up. I kept the mixing simple, nothing crazy or fancy, but it didn’t matter. The club manager was just happy that he didn’t have to plug in his iPhone. The best part about it was that my entire crew was right next to the booth, so with every big track I dropped I would turn and bounce with my entire group of friends. The whole roof was hoppin, it was one of the best feelings I’ve ever had in my entire life. It was so spontaneous but so perfect. My fill in set went without a hitch and I shut it down right at 2am as requested.

 

The manager offered to pay me but I refused payment. I had too much fun. He said that if I wouldn’t take cash, I had a bottle and table on him the next time I wanted to come out. I told him I would love to play here again in a better situation. We exchanged numbers and I began getting calls from there. It wasn’t an immediate residency though. I still had to earn it. I got some Thursday’s here and there and the occasional weekend spot. It was only after repeated good performances and learning to adhere to the manager’s out of whack desires did I get regular weekend spots.

 

I know it’s crazy. Almost unbelievable. But honest to god it happened.

 

TL;DR: Bedroom and house party DJd for couple years, filled in for a drunk DJ mid party at club, landed a residency

 Edit: thanks for the gold!!

Some of the reasons might be understandable (e.g., having less time available due to work and family). However, I've wondered for some time why some people who absolutely loved to go out and dance when they were younger completely stopped doing that at some point. 

On the other hand, I personally know active DJs (both for underground and mainstream music) in their 50s and 60s and also clubbers in that age group. I also see that there are some non-mainstream parties emerging that specifically target 30+/40+ as age groups. Those typically open earlier, end earlier and also make it clear that it won't be awkward to be there for someone who is not 21 any more.

So I've been wondering: What might be reasons for people to stop going clubbing? And what are possible approaches that we as DJs and promoters could take to make events feel inclusive for people of different age groups?",1702405124.0

I appreciate any kind words of encouragement. 

Last night After dark, someone climbed up the side of my home, somehow made it though iron bars, unlocked a second story sliding glass door, and came in. It’s a rental so I’m assuming they have hit this place before and know how to access the home. They stole 3 laptops, my journal, and cash. They weren’t able to fit my Ddj1000 back out through the bars, so thankfully I still have that (along w all my credit cards and IDs). My pregnant wife is safe as well. 

I play a big show later tonight and I’m just completely shook. Its my first gig in weeks and I’ve been working so fucking hard to craft 3 hours of quality vibes, and now it’s gone along with my laptops. Thank god I have some music backed up onto my portable flash drive which I had on my keys. But I lost days of work I’d prepared for the gig, all the acapellas I’d carefully sliced, and all my sampler routines I had planned out. I have some music to play on the drive but no way to go in and prep a set.

That’s all, I guess. I am feeling pretty numb and can’t really think straight right now. Send me some positive vibes for tonight.

Post-show Update: thank you all so much… literally brought me to tears reading a few of your inspirational posts. I put a few more details in a reply below, but overall the show went really well. It took a minute to find that flow and really lock in, I was just really uncomfortable at first without any track organization (the only usb I had was just raw tracks, no playlists) but once I found that rhythm, the next two hours were pure joy, like nothing could hold me back. Feeling that resilience you all talked about. Sending so much love out there to you all. Hope I can pay it back one day",1652970961.0

954,Always wear hearing protection,131,8tg2g0,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/8tg2g0/always_wear_hearing_protection/,52,"I just want to put out a friendly PSA. I can imagine that pretty much all of us started DJing because we have a strong passion for music and what better way to enjoy your favorite music than mix it together live with your own personal flair?

That said, if you want to keep the passion for your music alive I really recommend attenuated hearing protection. I'm not going to shill for my favorite brand, as there are many good ones out there but I will say you should all learn to carry hearing protection with you religiously. 

Tinnitus is an absolute bitch and it will never go away. If you don't want a dull continuous ring in your hearing that can affect how you enjoy music and your life outside of music then attenuated hearing protection is the best thing you can do for yourself. Very decent ones run for like 20 bucks and if anything on huge sound systems they make the music sound better, as they are literal mufflers for your ears.

Another thing to consider is that you don't always have to have the booth monitors topped near the max like your master output. Turn the booth monitors down when you're not mixing in a new track or if the sound system on the dance floor needs some help see if it is alright with the club/venue if you can't point one of the monitors onto the dance floor. 

I am so shocked to see some professional touring DJ's and producers who still don't wear hearing protection. I can only imagine that their hearing is absolutely fucked but yours doesn't have to be. 

Get 20 decibel or 27 decibel ones if you can. Some sound systems can put out over 130 decibels of sound which is absolutely insane for your hearing. I don't feel like pulling up the OSHA fact sheet on safe decibel and time limits but I can tell you prolonged exposure is not good for you and the damage is permanent.

This is just a friendly PSA, as I want all of us to continue doing what we love, and to be able to always hear the music as it is intended for the long term. Take care everyone. For real. ",1529822033.0

I've played the venue before, and I never had problems, but last night was different.

When I showed up, DJ Zeke was immediately complaining that there were other acts there besides him. He was told that he was the only one opening up. Fair enough, that does suck, but I was also booked to open.

Instead of letting me spin for the first 30 minutes as planned, he hopped on and spun instead. I tried talking to the promoters, who just said when he was done, I could play.

He never finished.

At this point, I'm getting pretty pissed off, and I had asked to mix multiple times. His response was to get on the mic and diss me and my partner in front of the entire crowd, calling us ""Hundred Dollar DJs"" and ""Jokes"".

I wasn't having any of it. I jumped to my mixer and started playing. 

His entire crew jumped on us. I was grabbed and pushed against the wall by his manager, my partner was threatened, and our mixer was unplugged.

I usually would never call out another DJ, but DJ Zeke completely disrespected me, as well as other DJs last night. That shouldn't be how things work, and if it is, this industry is way more fucked then I thought it was.

It's been almost 10 months since I've posted on /r/DJs \- been working hard under the radar and, come a long way now, I'm proud to share new full fledged features for DJs and live musicians of all kinds!

[CUE Music is a live audio streaming platform, free on iOS, Android, and Web, designed for DJs and musicians to perform and engage with an online audience](https://preview.redd.it/rblajhg1pqn31.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=02daf00c5664173380a6c3d78258e161d32cabdb)

&#x200B;

# Here's why I think everyone should be using CUE.

&#x200B;

**- Traktor, VirtualDJ, and Mixxx come with built-in broadcasting. You deserve a tool that lets you go live whenever you're mixing, simply by hitting that button! (Others can broadcast easily using BUTT - yes, BUTT)**

We built a new feature where you can go live just as you would on TwitchTV (but audio only) - just hit broadcast and you're live! Previously, the only broadcasting option was through scheduling a performance on one of the available stages, and this type of booking could be seen as a hassle to some, so we've built an instant stream option directly on your profile. But, a lot of additional features are only available if you perform on one of the stages so it's worth the extra hassle.

**- Most live streaming options require video, many of which get taken down due to copyright infringement (e.g. Facebook Live, TwitchTV)**

We are an audio only platform with licensing, automatic song detection, and a fluid music experience via mobile app and web platform. Want to mix and have your friends tune in on the road? Or want to share your live performances to your following on twitter? Or even embed a live music player directly on your website? CUE Music makes this easy and accessible. Each user and each stage has its own live player for sharing.

[Example embeddable live player for a stage](https://cue.dj/player/stage/residencies)

[Example embeddable live player for a user](https://cue.dj/player/REDIjay)

**-  We save a full track list of your all performances for your reference and exploration**

DJ programs with built-in broadcasting sends song metadata (for others, we use audio fingerprinting technology to detect songs) in which we cross-reference various databases to catalog all songs played on CUE Music by artist and record label. We currently only have \~40K unique songs that have been performed so far, but this system provides a great way to crate dig, listen to previews, and discover discrete songs that other DJs have already found and played.

**-  Listening to live music through other DJs, especially with social engagement and chat rooms is one of the best and most enjoyable ways to discover new music**

Not only is it enjoyable on the receiving end, it's really fun playing and having listeners engaging with your mix in real time over the internet. Each stage and each profile has its own chat room to engage the audience and DJ. You can also favorite songs that will auto save to your favorites collection as well as cheer on the DJ and see live animations for everyone's reactions.

**-  Other key features**

* Automatically save your performances to Mixcloud (currently only to CUE Music's account - will be able to on your own Mixcloud account in the future)
* Followers can receive notifications whenever you book a new performance and also when you go live
* Easy to use direct messaging system
* Live stream statistics dashboard to see a live tally of the audience's reactions
* Spotify integration so you can playback songs if you have Spotify premium

&#x200B;

We started sign ups at the end of June 2018 and are still in open beta. We want to get everything perfected to an industry grade caliber before we officially launch. We've not yet had any marketing efforts, so the community is still small (\~2.8K users & 400+ DJs), but we do intend to grow massively in the future.

Though small, our community is very welcoming, supportive, and active on the platform, so we welcome you all with open arms! We're aiming to launch at the beginning of 2020 and have been awarding an early user title ""CUE Pioneer"" to all users whom we intend on giving perks out to in the future (although unsure exactly what). So at the very least please do register and check out the platform!

Also, if anyone represents a large collective of DJs, music organization, record label, or music venue and would be interested in having your own stage on CUE, or even if /r/DJs would like its own stage for community building, please do contact me! We would love to provide a space for you to represent yourselves and for your communities to mix live for one another.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I want to give a huge thank you to /r/DJs, /r/Beatmatch, and DJ TechTools for being the open channels for getting CUE its first beta users. We wouldn't be anywhere without our beta users! <3

&#x200B;

Cheers!

However I noticed especially after the pandemic, and the rise of bars and lounges over large venue clubs, that the crowd isn't as receptive to warm ups as they were before.

Typically the warm up session, everyone grooves so whatever is being played (within reason of course)... Do a bit of drinking and socializing... That doesn't happen as often as before anymore... Now ppl either sit on their phones (since bars and lounges have more seating in comparison to most clubs I've played in), or just stand around until the hype/current shit gets played, or they finally get a little buzz going.

I feel like part of it is a result of the streaming era and the death of radio..
Say what u want about the radio era, but it made everyone, even casual music listeners, hear the same music, be it old or new. But with this new generation of club goers that grew up with streaming, they never had to listen to anything apart from exactly what they want to listen to... There's hardly any reason for them to be exposed to different music/artists than what they actively search for... So I find that when they do go out, they simply aren't interested in hearing anything else apart from the exact music they already listen to...

If course there are exceptions, and by the end of the night when everyone is drunk, they're more receptive, but that brings me back to my original point... The end of the night isn't the warm up portion... Now more than ever I've even seen the top DJs not get the crowd energy that they're used to when warming up... And what that has forced some DJs to do is play the current/primetime shit much earlier that they would like because as opposed to a big club, or a big event, these younger clubgoers will simply leave to go to a different bar...

Sorry for the long post, but just wondering if this is a trend that u guys have been noticing... Or is it different since many of u may DJ in spots that close at 2am, so the warm up time may not be as extensive for you to realize a difference... Because where I'm at, around 2am is where we get to the shits... Although it's not too frowned upon to start turning up between 1 and 2, depending on the DJs and the crowd",1702246533.0

The case only has that padded foam on one side so I’d probably need it on the other side as well at a minimum. 

Has anyone ever travelled with their xdj before and have any tips for padding and packaging etc? Thanks.",1701168749.0

I thought for sure the general consensus in the industry is that he’s one of few Real DJs around right now. But I’m learning that the definition of a Real DJ is subjective. 

In this [IG Reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CnRuK5DJsIb/?igshid=ZmMyNmFmZTc=)
, he showcases his ability to mix on four decks and it’s very well done, maybe one tiny mistake with the vocals but still inspirational nonetheless. 

Then I saw the comments…soooo Much Hate. I don’t understand it. Everyone calling him a Push Play DJ and “all he’s doing is looping” and “I bet he can’t do that on vinyl” 

Truly…who the fuck could do that on vinyl? on four decks nonetheless,And if he’s a push play DJ, then what the fuck is everybody else coz he seems to do more than most DJs out there? 

I guess I don’t understand the hate, even if you don’t like his music, surely you can appreciate his ability to mix? 

And really, I don’t care what people think of James Hype, I have my opinion, everyone is entitled to theirs, but reading the comments…apparently anyone using a CDJ or any modern DJ equipment makes you a lazy DJ, and I think that’s what concerns me most. 

I’m fully aware the trolls in the comments are probably talentless keyboard warrior hacks but I thought I’d get an opinion from this community. 

Cheers.

Edit: I guess there is another element of DJ’ing and that’s producer DJs like Stephan Bodzin and Richie Hawtin who will improvise tracks live and on the fly which is a whole other ball game but I digress.",1674350501.0

I have been a DJ for about 15 years.

I started in middle school, DJing YMCA teen night dances for $50 a gig with a radio shack mixer, 2 walkmen, and $30 car speakers. No joke. 

In college, I was doing 2-3 events a week. I got to a point where I didn't even need to look at my vinyl crates and was able to grab the right record out. And yes, kisses for requests work. Sometimes too well. 

Now, 15 years later. I have a full time non-DJing job. I have a family. I do about 5 bar gigs and 10 weddings a year, and I dread each one of them. 

The bar gigs are the ones that keep my creative juices going, but I just don't have the stamina to go to 1:30am anymore. And the money just isn't good enough for a 3-4 hour gig. 

The wedding gigs are good money, but it's just the same shit every time, and you get jaded very quickly in the wedding industry. You can only play Jason Mraz so many times before you bang your head on your laptop. 

I'll still have my home set up, I'll still seek out the vinyl section in every music store, but I think I'm done with gigs. 

This has been one of the best part of my life for 15 years, and I don't regret it for a second. I can't say every gig was fun, I think my worst had to be either the elementary school picnic, a birthday party where 2 people showed up, or the Korean wedding where a drunk groomsman attacked me with my own mic stand. But I can't think of a better feeling in life when there are a few hundred or thousand people in a room screaming and dancing to my songs for hours and hours. 

Keep the music alive guys. Keep trying new things. Keep failing, but keep getting up. ",1478118168.0

Not sure about you, but getting real tired of this shit being the reason you get to DJ at certain spots. 

Gigging shouldn't be based around how many you can bring along with you, especially at a venue that will pack out on a Saturday, not some brand new just opened club/bar. 

My job as the DJ is to get the people there to stay and buy drinks and have a good time. Keep them dancing. Make them want to come back. Make them stay and buy more drinks from your bar. 

Your promoters and social media teams job is to get people in the door. Sure, I'll promote my slot there and in turn your venue, but I'm not going to go begging my friends to come out and buy tables or make sure they mention my name at the door. I'm not going to go around begging people to buy bottles.

I expect to catch some flack for my opinion, but it seems ridiculous that I'm being turned down for more gigs at a venue because I didn't sell enough tables, when the bar was PACKED with people who stayed the entire night. My skills as a DJ, which is what I was hired to do, were up to par. Why am I being penalized because I couldn't sell bottles?

Edit: This was at a smaller venue. Out of the about 15 tables they had available for bottle service, 8 or 10 were sold. ",1552491151.0
998,Notes on some DJ Pools,122,hrq963,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/hrq963/notes_on_some_dj_pools/,92,"tl;dr:

* house DJ
* Heavy Hits is decent
* BPM Supreme is better
* ZIPDJ is best

For background, I was a regularly playing club DJ from 1997 through until the beginning of 2003. I was playing anywhere from three to five nights a week during this time. Played on both CD and vinyl. Heavy lean toward house, but reality meant I would end up playing a bit of hip hop, pop, and dance in my sets. I just started back in a little under two months ago with trying to build it back up again and turned to some DJ pools to build up my collection again without dropping $500 at Beatport.

Digital DJ Pool

This was the first one I tried out due to its $1 for five days/fifteen downloads per day trial. It seemed to be alright. I was able to crawl through all their releases from January 1 until the end of May and found 75 tracks. That seemed to be a good sign and I signed up for a month.

I don't know if it was the five full months of material to select from that gave the appearance of a lot of music that appealed to me or if the quality dropped significantly, but I quickly found I was going days without downloading anything. This included days where there were nearly 20 new tracks that met my search criteria.

It felt like it was being overloaded by user submitted content, giving it the appearance of having a lot of content. Most of this was mediocre to bad. In one case there was a track uploaded that not only wasn't mastered, but sounded like they hadn't bother to even try to mix it. The signal to noise ratio on DDJP was far, far  too low for me.

BPM Supreme

My second pool and a night and day change from DDJP. It feels a lot like a curated service where they only post the content that they believe is going to hit. For my searched there might only be four to ten tracks a day, but easily half of them were tracks I was interested in download. It's a solid service with decent quality. If it was my only pool I would be happy with it and would recommend it for anyone looking for a pool on a budget.

Doing the Damage

I picked this up on the recommendation from a throw away comment from someone here on Reddit. It is 90% bootlegs and mashups you can find yourself on Soundcloud and Hypeddit. Since I tend toward originals and current music, this ended up being almost worthless to me. Their cancellation policy is such that once you cancel your account you're immediately locked out. I cancelled my account early and closed the tab. I'll eat that lost money rather than spend 45 minutes every other day going through music I'm not interested in.

If you're heavily into mashups and bootlegs, it might be for you. It's not for me.

Heavy Hits

Another Reddit recommendation, but a really solid option. They tend to have more per day than BPM Supreme does, but I find they lag behind the release dates. I found one day where fully half of what had been posted was previously released by BPM Supreme anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months earlier. The other half of the content was either out of my general BPM range, bootlegs, or remixes of old tracks. It's definitely a solid service. If you're looking for more content at the same price as BPM Supreme, it's worth a look.

ZIPDJ

Mind blown.

I will admit this isn't for the faint of heart. It is drinking from the fire hose. In their 'house' section alone there are over 100 releases daily. It means you are going to be digging for tracks, but it also means you're going to find nearly every single thing you're look for. It is continuously updated and has a massive library. I took a cursory glance at how many 'house' releases they'd posted since July 1st and it was in the 2300 range. Other services you might get one or two remixes of a track. ZIP posts \_all of them\_ and the number of labels they get music from is insane.

There are three downsides.

1. It's expensive. Even their cheapest, download limit account is more expensive than BPM Supreme or Heavy Hits.
2. Single download. Once you've downloaded a track that is it. You can't download it again. Downloads are bundled in zip files and you've got 24 hours to redownload a zip bundle. After that, you're stuck. This happened to me where I assumed I already had a track and deleted the local copy (I empty recycling religiously) only to find out I was wrong. /sad trombone
3. You gotta dig and it takes time.

I've still got active BPM Supreme and Heavy Hits memberships. I don't think I'll be keeping them once they hit the end of their current month. I've also stopped trawling through Soundcloud and Hypeddit. I went from getting three to eight tracks a day using a combination of DDJP, Doing the Damage, BPM, Heavy Hits, Soundcloud, and Hypeddit to getting ten or more and having to pare it down from ZIP.",1594828908.0
999,AITA for telling my dj coworker to back off from hijacking my decks and criticizing my set at a gig?,120,1c8l6yl,DJs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/1c8l6yl/aita_for_telling_my_dj_coworker_to_back_off_from/,80,"I finally got a residency at a bar I have been trying to play for months just a few weeks ago. I play Friday nights while a guy who works for the same dj company I do plays Saturdays. He is in his 50’s and has been djing for way longer than I have (I’m 23). Every time I have played at this bar I have packed the floor and had people chant for an encore so I am familiar with this crowd and know what they like and how to get them hyped. 

Anyway my coworker stopped in tonight to watch me and I let him hang out with me in the booth. I was kind of put off when he told me to move over while he mixed a few tracks without asking me permission if he could. After he went to grab a drink he started texting me that I went into a “hood” rap set far too early in the night and that I should make more of an effort to blend my tracks better despite the fact that I was key and beatmatching and mixing in each song at least 8 bars before i made a full switch. 

Later, he came back up to the booth and hijacked my controller again and kept criticizing everything I was doing. The last straw for me was when I saw him load up a track I was hoping to save for later in the night. I told him not to play it because I wanted to save it and he went ahead and mixed it anyway. I then told him that while I appreciate his feedback and recognize that he has been doing this way longer than me, he was overwhelming me and that I wanted him to leave me alone. He told me to relax and have fun and that he never intended to piss me off, but that I needed to listen to him and learn from him. He could then see me become visibly upset and started apologizing and telling me I was doing a good job afterall. After we went b2b on a couple more songs, he finally left me alone and left the bar without saying goodbye, which is unlike him as he is usually very friendly. 

I look up to this guy a lot and worry that I came off as sensitive and unteachable, but like I said before I worked my ass for this residency and feel like he had no business “schooling” me on the spot like that, especially when he will be playing that same venue the following day and has had his residency there for years while this is finally my time to shine. I still get nervous at the beginning of my sets but once I get into the flow I’m good for the night. His barging in like that threw me off and stopped me from getting out of my head. Once he left I felt better and had a great rest of the night, but I cant stop thinking about how much better it would have been had he not intruded like that. Thoughts?",1713602710.0
