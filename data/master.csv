0,How many of you guys play multiple instruments?,12,musicians,107,I sort of assume that's just the norm? 
1,"I started guitar at 33 & I am now looking back. I‚Äôm impressed with my progress of the last four years, but I cannot stop being angry at myself for not starting sooner. Anyone else with a similar predicament?",16,musicians,33,
2,Tell me about the first time you got on stage (want to hear from everyone but ESPECIALLY singers),40,musicians,67,"I started learning guitar around 10 years old, and here I am at 28 and I've still never played a show. I'm such a coward about it. I hate eyes on me in any setting. I can play well when I'm alone, but as soon as I have an audience I start screwing up when playing anything that's not simple. Even if I write something cool and tell my wife to come hear it I'll screw it up every single time once she is present, and then when she leaves I'll get it right again. I was in a few bands as a teen and luckily could play in front of the few friends we would occasionally bring to practices, but I was terrified to get on stage when the time came. I was gonna suck it up and deal with it of course because It would have been more embarrassing to tell my friends I was scared, but fortunately we never made it that far so I never had to.

I've recently been getting into singing more, and my buddy and I have been producing some songs with me doing vocals instead of guitar. I kind of dig it and I think I like the idea of singing. But there's even more expectation for a stage presence as a singer because now you're talking to the crowd and people are paying more attention to you, at least as a guitarist I could just hang off to the side and do my thing. We're not even a band, so there's no plan to play any shows anytime soon. But last night I went to a show, and idk it just seemed so easy.  All these casual people just got on stage, did their thing, had fun, and got offstage. I kept just feeling disappointed that I've let so much time go by and haven't just done it yet.

I'm hoping to hear some of your first show nerve stories and how it went / how you felt afterwards to hopefully help me realize I can do it. So let's hear them!"
3,Think less about what fans can do for you:,14,musicians,2,"Balancing self-expression with serving your audience is crucial for success as an artist. Knowing your target demographic allows you to create content that resonates with them, rather than shouting into the void. 

Your entertainment style (music, fashion, videos, themes, social media, etc) isn‚Äôt for everyone. So who‚Äôs the average fan it‚Äôs for specifically?

Make a list of traits you think they have. For example, a band that sounds like Mumford & Sons will have a disproportionate amount of fans that drive Toyota and Subaru, enjoy hiking, listen to NPR, recycle, etc.

Marketing is a mixture of psychology and sociology. It involves building a brand your niche of followers identify with and nurturing relationships with them through thoughtful content. It's a symbiotic relationship where both artists and fans benefit.

Think less about what fans can do for you and more about what you can do for them.

Hope this helps!

4,‚ÄúFeeling the music‚Äù,11,musicians,26,"In college my buddy and I took a music performance class taught by a well-respected jazz reed player. For an assignment we wrote and performed an acoustic guitar duo instrumental piece, and during the performance we were kind of moving our bodies and grooving to the rhythm. The instructor criticized this and pointed out in front of the rest of the class that what we were doing was an unnecessary, fake and ‚Äúmasturbatory‚Äù thing done primarily to convince an audience that you are special and gifted and are ‚Äúfeeling the music.‚Äù

I was kinda embarrassed after that and the situation affected me. I adopted a more stoic stage presence and tried to minimize my guitar face, modeling the professionalism of classical musicians. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd was my model of how this restraint could be shown in a rock music context.

I became judgmental of musicians who display this behavior, even if I liked their music. John Mayer was a good example for me of a talented musician who I unfortunately got second-hand embarrassment watching his head-bobbing and O-face.

I am now trying hard to reserve judgment when others express themselves that way as long as it is done genuinely and authentically.

What do others think? Is this behavior self-serving and done only for show? When you see musicians doing this what emotions and feelings does it invoke in you? Does it make you believe they have an extra special connection to music? Conversely, does the image of a stoic musician somehow diminish their impact for you?"
5,"Im building an app for discovering and exploring geographically based content. More than anything, when people drive they want to listen to music. Would you, as an artist, be willing to give your input on an app such as this?",1,musicians,1,
6,Exciter - Destructor Bass Cover,1,musicians,0,"A band that was on my cover wishlist for a long time and on the top with mercyful fate. This one makes me very very happy.

The purest speed metal band and one band always mentioned when the genre speed metal is talked about. Plus speed metal is my favourite genre. Some more factors like Canadian speed metal being an underrated piece of art. These forces were at work pushing me to cover Exciter.

Also I find the genre particularly hard to cover because of the precision and all that speedy alternate picking and chugging. Well, gave my best, working on it and wish to perfect it someday.

The song is one of my favourite exciter songs and underrated, just like the album, the band, the scene, the genre and every single musician in the band. Bass mostly follows the guitars and relatively simple in comparison to other exciter songs. Carries the motorhead like rhythm throughout and takes a U-turn into blazing alternate picking with thunderous double bass drums. Amazing solos as well.

The challenge for me, again was the fast alternate picking and had to mix the song to increase the drums, as is the challenge in most of the 80s speed and thrash metal songs. Important here is syncing the tempo of the song in your head. 

Original Bassist - John Ricci
Genre - Speed Metal
From the album 'Violence And Force'

10,Changing up gig habits,28,musicians,83,"My band has a standing gig at a craft beer joint everyone month, so needless to say, we imbibe some tasty beverages courtesy of the house. I‚Äôve gotten into a rut and I can tell it affects my playing later in the night as well as my mental state the rest of the weekend. Any tips for drinks to replace the IPAs and such?

11,I auditioned for a band and I‚Äôm confused,4,musicians,28,"I‚Äôm a singer and songwriter and I auditioned for a band a month ago, they said they were so happy and very keen with me they were absolutely amazed with my performance.
They said that they wanted to add me in the band and in the group chat of the band.
Then the next day they said that they actually have three more people to audition that they said they addition before meeting me in Person .
So I said, yeah, that‚Äôs fine even though in my head I‚Äôm like well if you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm in the band then why is it different now? But I just went along with it. 
They had to delay the Singer audition twice
First time is a week and the second time it‚Äôs just by a few days, but it‚Äôs just dragging along so much and I asked my sister for advice and what to reply to this and she said to say no to the band because it‚Äôs not fair that they‚Äôre stringing me along for this singer that they‚Äôre finding a difficult date to audition her for.
I don‚Äôt really know what to do in the situation because I do deserve some self-respect as I know my worth but also I really like this band."

13,Growing Fans After Gigs,14,musicians,18,"Hi r/musicians,

Long time lurker of reddit and just discovered this subreddit. Wanted to ask for some advice, what sorts of things do you do to thrn a casual attendee/walk-in from a gig to a full-time fan? My band has been gigging at local spots for the last 6 months or so, album released on spotify etc, but want to continue to grow a local fan base and headline larger venues.

We typically do one or to promotional lines in the set between songs, but that‚Äôs really about it. Shout the instagram, give out some free stickers, say thank you. Wondering what sorts of things you all do to get that new listener engaged and bring them into your sphere. Looking forward to advice and improving our ability to grow our fanbase!"
14,I was a musician,37,musicians,34,"I was a musician. Now, idk. Doesn't feel right to claim it. I hardly look at my guitar. I hardly sing. It makes me sad to think about, it's like a part of me died but I've just changed directions a lot. 

I care about art and music. Music very definitely plays a major role in my daily life. I just don't know how to pick it up again. I'm disgusted with my lack of skill and the fact that I never did get that good. 

There's really no point to this post, I guess I just wanted to vent. 

I hope Y'all the best whether it's fun around a camp fire or goals to fill the garden stadium. "
15,I messed up accepting an unpaid gig. How do I move forward? ,0,musicians,7,"Ok. So last Wednesday I was at an open mic and jam I frequent and after my set this one lady who was there and seems to be a friend of the MC/host of the open mic approached me about playing at a faire in the city. 

I said I was down and gave her my card. In my eagerness, I didn't ask about compensation initially and when I inquired about it over email later and she confirmed it was unpaid or ""about exposure"" as she put it ( I know, yuck), that I shouldn't bring a tip jar and that I'd be granted a pin that would give me entry to this festival for the entire week as well as a wristband for a guest and get free parking on the days I was playing.  She also sent a PDF with the address, some phone numbers, what was expected and what equipment they would have available. 

Looking back it was obvious why she was asking randoms last minute. At the time it just seemed like a good opportunity. 

Anywho, at that point I felt I had already committed, and that I should keep my word. And in my mind, it's not like I'm getting ABSOLUTELY nothing from it. Just no cash. I did end up putting a hat I brought with me at my feet incase somebody wanted to give me a totally unsolicited gift, tho. 
 

I played the first set I agreed to earlier today, and I have another scheduled for Sunday. I'm not dissapointed in my performance. And a lot of folks liked what I do, but I feel a little dirty.  Like I let my local music communtiy down as well as myself by doing this. 

It do seem to have a bit of an out however. They didn't actually have all the stuff they said they would. The pdf said they'd have three 1/4 guitar cables but they had none, so I performed mic'd. That's fine and all, it's not like I've never done it before, but they didn't hold up their end of the deal in this regard. Most of the other equipment was in a sorry state as well, but that's OK. At least they had a PA system. 

What do you guys think I should do?

I think accepting this gig was wrong, in my opinion, but I don't know what the right move going forward is. I feel like any choice I make as of rn is somewhat justified, but I don't know which is best. I don't think these folks are ill intentioned and I don't want to screw them. Many of the staff were very helpful.  But, I  also don't want them to make a habit out of trying to get free performances from people.

Hey everyone,

Wanted to share this story to hopefully inspire some of you on this forum to pursue your passion musically.

I‚Äôm 36 years old and grew up glued to VH1 and MTV. Some of my fondest memories as a kid were staying up late on New Years Eve watching the top 100 songs of the year countdown.

After discovering The Beatles through my parents vinyl collection, I asked for their CD‚Äôs for my 8th birthday. For my 9th birthday, I asked for an electric guitar. I only had that guitar for a couple weeks before my sisters complained and I had to trade it in for an acoustic. It was way too big and after unsuccessfully trying to play it I put it back in its case where it remained for a decade.

About every 5 years I would take it out and attempt to learn. When I got into my Alice In Chains phase senior year of high school I went for lessons but nothing stuck. When Chris Cornell died in 2017 I ordered a new guitar that night. Again, I gave up when I couldn‚Äôt form the chords.

In 2021 I started running with a man named Robert ‚ÄúRaven‚Äù Kraft in my hometown, Miami Beach. Ravens story requires more than a few paragraphs, but to some it up, this man has run 8 miles on the beach every single day since January 1st 1975. The run started out of heartbreak after he found out a hit song he had written was stolen from him.

Ravens dream is to have a hit. Him and I would discuss music every run (to date I have run with him over 220 times). We would fantasize about me learning guitar and him providing lyrics, starting a real rock and roll band.

In the winter of 2021 my job was on strike so I had a lot of extra downtime. I decided once again to pick up the guitar. This time, inspired my Ravens dedication, I decided I would play 1 hour a day, everyday, for the entire year of 2022.

By June, I was comfortable playing in front of my girlfriend. By October, my best friend was coming over once a week and we started forming songs. By November, we felt the music was good enough and all we were missing was lyrics.

We invited Raven over, who penned his 1701st song in about 10 minutes, our first single, Digging Her Grave.

Another runner joined us from Haiti and plays bass, another runner from Serbia came over and introduced his native Tambura to the band. Finally, a man named Bryan we found on Facebook came over and decided he wanted to produce the album.

In 2023 we became Raven and the Dark Shadows. Our first live performance was a disaster, but we regrouped and practiced more. We found a studio and recorded 10 tracks. Through my connections and Raven‚Äôs fame we convinced Dave Abbruzzese (Pearl Jam), Ian Grushka (New Found Glory), Keli Gunnarson (Agent Fresco) and Dave Pastorious (tech 9) to guest on several tracks.

We released our album, An Unkindness, in November of 2023. To celebrate, we had a show at the Wolfsonian with over 150 people attending. 

Jack White‚Äôs Third Man Pressing is currently producing Blue and Yellow vinyl editions of An Unkindness that should be ready by the summer. 

Our song Dracula just reached 30,000 streams. In addition to our music, I produced 4 music videos for our band. A fifth animated one will be out next week.  Total views on YouTube are north of 20,000. 

At a recent Florida Panthers hockey game, our song, Dead End Road, was played after the Panthers scored a goal. It‚Äôs also been used at various Spring Training stadiums around Florida this spring. The Miami Marlins have it on their batting practice playlist. 

We are currently preparing our second album. All the songs have demos, we just have to find the time to enter the studio and begin the process. We hope to have our second album released by October of 2024.

On January 1, 2025, Raven celebrates his 50th year of the streak. We are hoping for more exposure for the band when this happens.

I hope this inspires you all. In my mid 30s I definitely didn‚Äôt expect something like this to happen, but if you really commit to something, dreams can come true. 

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on the project and the sound. I‚Äôd also love to get recommendations on what we can do better, as we prepare for album number 2. Here is a link to our Spotify, thank you!

21,Being in a band is hardly worth the stress. Should I take break from music?,120,musicians,208,"My last band broke up recently. I‚Äôve always loved music. I‚Äôm just sick of all the BS that comes along with being in a band. It seems like being in a band is 95 percent BS like all of the band members disagreeing about the set list, trying to get everyone‚Äôs schedules lined up, band members who aren‚Äôt committed, and a constant clashing of egos. I don‚Äôt really sing, so that takes most solo gigs off the table. I would like to keep making music, but after this last band I feel like I need a break from dealing with band mates, venues etc. I used to look forward to making music and now it seems like a chore.

anyways do you think I can run all 3 speakers at once? Like the combo on top and the 212 on bottom ? Here‚Äôs some pics  let me know what you think. 

I‚Äôd like to see what it sounds to run all 3 speakers simultaneously but I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll mess something up or blow up my amp/trans!! and the risk isn‚Äôt worth it when I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be plenty loud through the 212 alone.

26,ways to promote your music?,3,musicians,6,"making music is amazing and streams atm are not my priority. But it still is and feels nice that you know people like your music in terms of streams and exposure.

In this generation it feels like the only way to get exposure is:

1. spam tiktok with non interesting content until people listen to your music
2. play live and tour n stuff

Do you guys know any other ways of getting exposure to potential fans without using tiktok/instagram?

Im really interested in this since i have released my new album today and i'm very proud of it.

40,Rant for the multi-instrumentalists ,0,musicians,46,"Just wanted to rant for a moment because this is 100% a ""problem"" that can only be solved on my own because everybody is different and has different goals in music and I need to figure out what mine actually are, but maybe I can get some inspiration here.

I am by no means an expert at playing anything, I am completely self taught and wouldn't even consider myself intermediate level at any single instrument, but I want to be proficient in playing them and I want to actually improve all the time. For the life of me though, I just cannot commit to just one of them. I'm fully aware that all of the time I spend on each one, (keyboard/synth, guitar, and tenor sax), is time that could be spent focusing on just one of them and actually seeing real improvement. 

But I can't help myself, life feels too short to only experience a single way to play music and I just don't feel too strong of a pull towards one more than the others. They're all fun and rewarding in their own unique ways! At the same time though I don't like the feeling like I'm just noodling around with three instruments and not seeing progress on any of them. In my hubris I convinced myself I could see steady improvement on all three if I stuck to a consistent schedule with them, but life finds a way to ruin your plans really quickly Ive found, making both time and energy really precious commodities.

If there was one I had the most experience with, it would be keyboard, and should probably be the one to focus on more because it's so much more intuitive in general and will give me the most applicable skills to apply to the others (not to mention that I actually play synth for two bands at the moment so that should be enough motivation right there, you'd think...) But I get bored with practicing a single instrument so quickly some days that I find myself rotating around all 3 in a single practice session. 

Can anybody else relate to this?? Are there any aspiring/successful multi-instrumentists that can share their experience or wisdom on this? Even anyone that specializes in a single instrument and why they feel such a draw to that one in particular? I am really curious about your experiences learning and performing music.



EDIT: Reading through everyone's anecdotes and stories is so cool and is really helping me contextualize my own journey with learning music. I think I have a pretty good grasp on how I want to go forward with it all now. Thank you everyone!"

It‚Äôs even gotten to the point where they ask to play my guitar (f*** no you‚Äôre not playing my Martin). I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a solo performer or what, but I feel like this never happens when I‚Äôm out at a bar and I see full bands playing. I usually tell people I‚Äôd rather not risk damaging my equipment, but they always come back with something and are relentless for me to give them their moment. 

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this problem and how to handle it. I try to say no nicely but I feel like sometimes the only way to get the point across is to be blunt af about it. And then I get worried they leave the bar thinking I‚Äôm an asshole"

44,Is it possible to commission a musician to record a piece ?,1,musicians,5,"Hi,

So, everything is in the title. 
I''m currently running a DnD campaign and I wanted to use a piece as a theme song for the main antagonist. It's the Prelude in c sharp minor by Rachmaninoff, but transcripted for the organ.

I've found a couple of video online but this is a piece I really really like on a personnal level and turns out, I'm not satisfied with either of those interpretations. So, I was thinking, maybe I can commission an organist to play it and record it for me ? Is it even a reasonable demand to make ? What would be a correct budget for it ?

I have no idea where to look, so I just thought of Reddit as a start. "

47,Your favorite portable (pocket-size) non-reed instrument for suggestions? ,16,musicians,65,"I played Clarinet for years and I travel a lot, plus I'm a circus performer. I've been interested in picking up a woodwind (but open to brass/string) that's very portable (like fits in a large coat pocket type portable), doesn't require much maintenance, but also has some range on it. I was thinking of recorder, but I haven't seen any videos really selling me on it and it has a pretty strong connotation of being a beginner/school kid instrument, which I know is more so just being cheap and easy to give to a kid. That led me to the tin whistle, but it seems very limited, which is a negative effect most small/portable instruments suffer from. 

I would like to avoid instruments with reeds that aren't built in, like the xaphoon, for example, or need electricity/batteries. I would prefer a whistle type mouthpiece, but I'm potentially open to something you traditionally see with flutes if it grabs my attention. I'd also like it to have pretty good range on the type of music it can play, which I know will also vary based on the music itself (trad/folk music from various parts of the world ex: Irish, Japanese, Native Am, etc). 

I even looked at non-woodwind like the pocket trumpet, but it seems to be unpopular due to poor construction, or the pocket violin, but would take a loooot more practice (but I'm comparing that to why I never learned my violin as an adult, because of the time investment just to get to mediocre). I do already have a kalimba which I dabble with, but lacks the range in types of music it can sound like. 

I know that greatly limits my options, but curious if I'm missing something after looking over recorder, tin whistle, pan pipes, quena, native flute, venova, ocarina, harmonica, jaw harp, and more. I'm probably leaning towards tin whistle, because the cost, ease of use, and portability greatly outweigh the con of its limits, but curious if there was something that might fit what I'm looking for better. 

I appreciate the suggestions and looking forward to researching what's mentioned. Thanks! "

I've done band and theater my whole life and have gotten into sound production for shows at a local community theater. I have been doing sound production for 3 years now and was thinking of trying to make a some sort of living out of it. I love singing and peforming live and I want to try to mix that with sound production skills to make music.

My quesiton is how?

The only sound production I've done is live so I'm not sure how useful it'd be in creating music but I want to try. I'm just not sure how to get going or what to do after high school.

I have very good grades and will being getting a scholarship that will pay for my tution in full for any college in my state (FL). I don't want to waste the oppurnity of this free tution but I also want to try to make a carrer in music and don't know how helpful college will be.

He wouldn't play in time or listen to the rhythm section. 

Even though I enjoyed playing out it was draining and I also worried it would reflect poorly on me. I'm not perfect but I recognize when I mess up and practice. He didn't seem to do this and actually would get annoyed we didn't know the songs he had just come up with. So I stopped playing. 

He's reached out about playing again. Apparently he's had trouble finding backing musicians, so I feel bad. But I am wary of being in more bad shows.

64,Band mate has ‚Äúallegations‚Äù against him,55,musicians,200,"So my band and I have gotten back together after a few years apart, and are releasing new music soon and were set to play a show to promote the new tunes. The day after our first post about it, the club emails us and says they‚Äôve been informed about allegations against my band mate, and will no longer be allowing our band to play. I was blindsided, I had no clue about any of this. My band mate informs me that a few years ago, while he was involved in another group, that he was having sex with a woman who had a boyfriend. The boyfriend found out one way or another, and my band mate claims that to save face, she accused him of assault. The rest of the group took her side, and he resigned his position. 

Now I‚Äôve known this dude half my life. I just can‚Äôt fathom him doing anything remotely related to sexual assault, but I also struggle with accepting that someone would lie about something so serious, although I know that‚Äôs happened. There‚Äôs no evidence in either direction other than the word of both parties, and I‚Äôm still vague on some things, including the exact nature of the allegations. But now I‚Äôm in the unenviable position of either believing my friend and appearing to be an apologist for abuse to at least some group of people, or terminating his role despite his possible innocence. Has anyone been through something similar, or just have any advice for me? Thanks

EDIT: just to add some details, there was never any police involvement, and he‚Äôs claiming they had multiple sexual encounters, and that she was living with the boyfriend at his parents house during all this. "

That happened to me today and here I am struggling to put the chords behind the said melody. To get it out of the way, I DON'T HAVE ANY MUSIC THEORY KNOWLEDGE, at all. I'm self taught at pretty much every instrument that I play, this one in particular is an acoustic guitar. So the chords that I got out of the melody for an intro is EM7 then Ebm7 then C#m7, and the stanza just goes EM7 and C#m7 twice.

So, in an attempt to help algorithms better understand my own songs and those of other talented musicians I've discovered here on Reddit, I'm creating playlists from time to time featuring bands that complement each other (folk, indie pop, dream pop, indie rock, shoegaze, and all kinds of dreamy vibes). The main goal is to have the algorithm recommend our songs.

&#x200B;

If anyone's interested, please DM me with Spotify links to your songs and a bit about yourself/your band (if they fit the project). Also, send a screenshot showing that you've saved the playlist. I'll disregard anyone who just dumps links without any context of their work or doesn't follow the guidelines for promotion.

&#x200B;

Of course, this will only be effective if people also share and listen to the other bands. Engaging, liking, and commenting on their music also helps establish a connection to the algorithm between their sound and yours. So, if you could check out the bands from this playlist and, if you like any, show them some support! Let's grow together!

I'm not an expert at this, so any suggestions are also welcome!

So I‚Äôve just been thinking. With the whole craze of AI, artist already not making money off of streaming what‚Äôs next? Vinyl,cds,streaming.. where is it going from there?

113,I'm worried about not knowing everything,1,musicians,6,"Being a full-time music student, I know some basic music reading and some music theory. I have been playing music since I was a young teenager, but didn't learn all of the other stuff until about a year ago. I keep worrying about not understanding it. Some of this stuff is hard to grasp, like how major and minor chords on guitar are different if you have root on E string and when you have the root on the A string for example. Maybe I'm thinking too hard about it. How long does it take a person to really learn and understand music theory? Maybe I need to hear it as well to understand it?

I am autistic, so I like a linear thought process...A is the note, the chord is formed from these intervals, etc. etc. Maybe I just need to watch a few YouTube videos before I grasp it? How long did it take y'all to get music theory and really, truly understand it and how it works? I look at all these things sometimes and my autistic mind is overwhelmed with information and I freak out."

130,House shows with grumpy neighbor,24,musicians,37,"My bandmates and I are moving into a new house in May and wanted to use the basement to practice and potentially host house shows.  We wanted these shows to be focused on people having a good time listening to the music and not getting wasted (like some other house venues in town promote) so we'd plan on trying to draw a pretty tame and respectful crowd.  Recently we learned that our next-door neighbor is a grumpy old lady who has harassed bands who have lived in the house in the past.  These bands used the basement for a practice space and she would yell at them to be quiet, spewing falsities such as lying about the way the noise ordinance works in town.  She would also threaten to call the band's parents (ok??), the landlord (they don't care), and the cops (the only group I am worried about).  I think we should be able to practice without much trouble but we are unsure about the house show thing now.  According to the band who lives at the house now this neighbor has never called the police on them but they have also never hosted shows there.  Generally, the cops in town are not assholes about house shows so I'm not sure there would be much of an issue but I'd still like to avoid it.  One other thing I should add is that this neighbor technically does trespass into the backyard to bang on the windows of the basement when bands have been practicing in the past."

133,"Possibility music got stolen?
",2,musicians,5,"
 A few years back when i was making tons of music i got really friendly with some dude i met on a music production discord server. We started giving each other feedback and then i mustve sent him over 20 demos. And then at one point, his music was like suspiciously good and i realized he was literally sending me music from ncs and was asking me to give feedback on it. I also somehow didnt realize this but on his youtube channel back then(he deleted everything now i just checked) his songs were content ID by small artists! I even asked him about it lol but he just said ""idk people hate me."" 

I just realized that he couldve stolen some of my work or something after i came across some reddit posts of very similar things. Its been like 4 years since and like im getting back into music quite a bit again, and i wanna finish some of these unreleased songs. You guys think if he ripped some of my melodies or music and released it or sold it somewhere, I would still be protected by copyright laws(from Canada btw)?

136,How to Let Go of Negative Experiences that Made You Lose Faith in Playing? ,22,musicians,55,"Before I stopped, I was a lifelong player of music. Bass and Bari Sax. Got eaten alive by college and the job market after, tried several bands afterwards that would go from 6 months to a year of nothing but accolades (top 40 classic rock/ RnB hits, 60s/70s Ska, proto punk like Johnny Thunders, etc).

Rock/punk bands were longer, bitchier projects; always a conflict over whatever could be identified as out of order. A few bands went over years that never returned on the time invested. 

I severely lost interest in music when I had a friend reveal that he was essentially poisoning the well of friends that we both shared in music. This after we more or less got scammed bait and switch style by a singer's ambitions to get laid with someone who more or less had her own musical ambitions that hijacked ours. Long story. 

I've always thought of myself as original, but when most people all the way from family to (what you know as) friends convey all your ideas are garbage, it's better to just assimilate to someone else's agenda, enjoy being the tool, you'll go places, it rips all connection I have with music out. 

I love music when I think it's appreciated. But my experience has been you're only valued so long as you fuel someone else's show. 

How do you put aside all the ""shit"" that you deal with trying to relate to people? I look back on a lot of what I dealt with, and despite getting a DAW and audio interface I just feel disconnected.

Elevator music is the absolutely the wrong concept, but it's more robotic, it's not as organic, and it's hitting things exactly when it needs to be hit and it attacks you.

When you have musicians, and even producers, that take the time to give each sound it's own journey into the open space of that music, it's just distinctly different.  As opposed to someone just layering things over and over with ""that sounds great"" as the leading idea.

I'm probably in my head about this, though.  I know there's tons of nuance.

178,How do I know if I can be a musician?,3,musicians,10,"Hey guys, I'm new to this subreddit and I'd like to ask a question to real musicians. 

I'm in late 20s, an instrumentalist(i play drums) and going to be a student at music uni. But recently I have big doubt about my dream. 

In my teenager time although I enjoyed listening music, I never thought to be a musician or make my own music. I started this thing just bc musicians seemed so cool and I wanted to be like them.
Practicing was fine. I liked making my skills better. BUT when I realize I can't do music alone, things started going worse. When I play with others, I feel somehow wrong. I always feel anxiety about I may ruin this so I can't enjoy that time and usually lack of confidence. Is this normal? I guess maybe it is because I've never been in school band or gig with friends. my only experience playing with others is ensemble class at academy. But still...

Also, I feel like I don't like listening to music much. I too easily get tired when I listen to any kind of music. I prefer to do other things rather than listening music in my free time. This is getting worse recently, but I think it's been like this since long ago.

I feel like I'm not going to handle this if I go to uni as I am now. I assume all students at there LOVE music and I know I don't. Tuition fees are expensive and I'm not sure this is worth trying. 

Am I burn out or is this really not my aptitude? Has anyone been the same situation like I am now? I look forward any kind of advice. Thank you."

180,Marketing strategy for long term streams/listeners,1,musicians,1,"Hey everyone,

I know someone out there has experienced this and hopefully found a solution that I haven‚Äôt tried yet.

I have been releasing music for over a year now. Every time I release a new single, my monthly listeners skyrocket and the song is getting consistent attention. 

Within 1 month, my 24hr streams decrease to half they were the first couple weeks. But I never change my promotion strategy. I know this is a sign of people not liking the song and moving on, but if that was the case, I wouldn‚Äôt have a 10% playlist add rate. Right?

I use submithub, social media, and the Spotify algorithm to get my music heard. Ive never had a TikTok reach over 1k views in my career and I post almost every day. 

I know this may sound crazy, but I know some people who mention that deleting and remaking a different TikTok account may give you more luck and a fresh start. It seems like no matter the content, hashtags, sounds or length of my videos, they don‚Äôt get past 0 views majority of the time.

186,Survey: how do you study songs and artists to influence your own music?,3,musicians,1,"Hi! I've been creating music for about 20 years. I've recently lost my non-music related full-time job, and am taking this time to find a new project where I can combine my passion (music) with what I most liked about my career (data). 

My musical process is mainly driven by my own personal tastes, intuitions, and creativity (what makes me me). Simultaneously, I am inevitably influenced by the songs and artists that I like the most or that are most successful in my chosen genres. For the latter, I often self-study by active listening and analysis or by consuming videos or data to understand what makes that music great, impactful, and palatable for the audience in these genres. I like understanding, musically, *why* we like it so much. 

I would like to build a project that allows musicians to easily access and understand data related to successful music and its attributes, such as tempos, key signatures, chord progressions, song lengths, themes, and instruments used. The data would be compiled and accessible to understand what current successful songs have in common on a broader scale, to help us, as musicians, be more successful by 1) adapting to trends or 2) differentiating ourselves from trends to help us stand out. 

The purpose of this project is not to encourage artists to ""sell out,"" but rather to leverage data to help us become successful. Just like any other industry, it's important to understand the market we're part of in order to achieve sustainable success, and that's my ultimate aim: helping educate and inform the creative process with data to help us live out our dreams.

I've put together a quick, anonymous survey and would be appreciative of anyone that would like to collaborate. Thank you so much in advance!

So the other day I get a DM from a individual in my Instagram. Stating that he really liked my music and that he wrote for a relatively big music blog/editorial.

And the conversation was relatively normal asking about my writing process, influences etc and then they ask if I have ever been written about or would like to be? I ask them what they mean and get this response. Which when life says something is too good to be true I get weirded out but I have no idea how to check if they are legit.

193,"One member of the band is so bad that he's dragging everyone down, but he's also a good friend. How Can I handle this ?",81,musicians,158,"Hi there,

A bit of context: I joined a blues rock band over a year ago as a singer. It's a group of four friends from the same village, all in their forties, and I'm the newcomer, the youngest, the girl... 
I got back into music after a long break and I really clicked with the atmosphere. We don't have any ambitions other than having fun. At first, I was finding my groove, no problem, but the more we progress, the more I feel limited.

Well, they're not great musicians, they know it, but I don't hold it against them; playing for fun is also good, and I have another more serious project on the side. I won't dwell on all the problems, because ultimately, they'd probably all be solved if we had a decent drummer.

But our drummer is a nightmare. Can't keep the beat, gets lost in the songs, and is very (very) limited technically. It's awful. I've put in a lot of effort to help him improve, but everything I try fails.

I know that without him, everything would be better, and in fact, I took advantage of a day when he wasn't there to suggest to the others to play along with a drum machine. They played better than ever and they noticed it. 
But here's the thing: as bad as our drummer may be, he's also a good guy. And especially, he's the mega buddy of the two guitarists. So, I don't come out as a winner if there's ever an open ""conflict"" except that...

...They've also all noticed that I push them to do better. Let's say that my outsider perspective encourages them to challenge themselves more than they did before, just among friends... And I can see that they feel inspired to try more complicated things. They would definitely be capable of it with another drummer, once again.

So, the question is:
How do I convince them to say goodbye to the drummer?
Or from your experiences, is it a lost cause, and should I leave the ship or keep my mouth shut? (Which would be ironic for a singer...).

My first issue is the default audio driver is very weak, offering poor midi latency and often craps out on me. There is a better audio driver (ASIO) but it doesn't play nice with other software and shuts down audio from all other applications. I plan on buying an audio interface then running the audio output from the DAW to it, then back to the computer as I've heard it has a built in audio driver (or a sound card? Still learning all this stuff). Secondly, OBS has an audio mixer built in to master all the volume levels (vocals from your mic, audio output from the DAW, audio from other applications) and it's garbage. It's okay for playing video games or just talking but it's not designed for music.  I have no way of listening back to my final mix live (what my viewers) hear, so when I watch  my VODS back sometimes my vocals are drowned out by the instruments. Any advice?"

He was playing drums at 10 mos and strummin on the Loog by 2. At 4, he makes up his own songs with advanced rhyme schemes, impressive timing, and hilarious story arcs. He knows genres by ear and is able to name musicians he knows by hearing any song from their discography.

We aren‚Äôt the type to toss around the word genius but we do want to do everything we can to help flourish whatever musical talent that is clearly waiting to come out. 

His birthday is right around the corner and we would like to get a few things to set him up to explore his sonic youth. (Corny, I know) Does anyone know of any good kid‚Äôs pianos that have teaching apps? We may buy another Loog cause he smashed the other one like a lil rock star (in reality, he was just too young to have one at the time). Does anyone have any youtube/online music learning channels/classes? Is a drum/midi/synth controller/pad a good idea? He loves the stylophone, is there a larger/louder version that is kid friendly? We don‚Äôt want to break the bank but we do want to invest in something he obviously loves.

Also, how do we do our best to encourage him to continue exploring? We don‚Äôt live in a town with a lot of live shows and the ones that are here happen to be kind of one note (lots of blue grass & country).

I got myself a remote job so I could focus on random shit I love when projects aren‚Äôt heavy. I used to tour in my twenties but it wasn‚Äôt sustainable. I settled down‚Äîfocused on a safe career that made money.  That wasn‚Äôt to say that every time I saw a live band I didn‚Äôt kick myself for not putting in the work to bring up there onstage. 

In fact as a dropout in high school and then finishing that, dropping out of college ‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt make music a focus in my life until I could support myself. For anyone who grew up poor and with no safety net‚Äîyou probably get it. But with that I didn‚Äôt surround myself with people who let me live in that world. 

I really do stereotypically believe music IS my life and as a performer all my life I wish I had people around me to jam with. 

Every musician who I hooked up with just didn‚Äôt feel that magic with me and I never played music with someone I was dating. There‚Äôs a huge part of me that wishes I did have that type of love but alas, life goes on‚ÄîI got married and had a kid. 

Then out of performing again I‚Äôve been asked to play and do backup vocals with a really amazing local band that does my genre and style. It‚Äôs honestly really nice even if no one in that band is within +/- 7 years of my age.  (I‚Äôm really grateful to find an opportunity like this late in life because the musician community I grew up around lived ate and breathed it but I could never be that brave.) 

And now in the age of doom scrolling whenever I see advice to do the thing you love so your tribe can find you playing music resonates louder than ever. 

Anyway, aside from the existential threat of knowing what it feels like to deny one‚Äôs self of life‚Äôs basic pleasures‚Äîdoes anyone juggle the same shit out there? How do y‚Äôall keep sane?

228,Feeling Discouraged,2,musicians,17,"I‚Äôve been learning guitar (and drums) for the last 6 months and something I struggle with mentally is how late I started. I had a decent home life as a kid but I was never encouraged to explore my own interests so I didn‚Äôt seriously pick up guitar until 22. I learned maybe 2 simple songs previously but that‚Äôs it.

Now at 22, I‚Äôm realizing that being a career musician is always what I‚Äôve wanted, but being behind my peers who started young I feel like I‚Äôm at a disadvantage to achieve the level of greatness required to be a successful musician. 

I‚Äôve always had an ear for music and singing but I didn‚Äôt capitalize on it in my teens and I sort of regret it. My folks pushed me down the STEM track and only now do I realize it‚Äôs not my gig.

I‚Äôve been on a certain track for years because it‚Äôs what my parents wanted and now I have to make this change in order to be happy and I need a lot more experience to make it work. Ik a guy who started touring at 18 and I‚Äôm not even ready to think about touring! Some people start younger, are excellent players, but still take them a decade to be financially successful. I just have no idea how I‚Äôm gonna make it work when most serious musicians are well on their way by now. 

I guess I recognize the benefit of starting young and sticking to something. Now I‚Äôm sweating practicing a couple hours a day trying to ‚Äòcatch up.‚Äô Nobody believes I‚Äôm serious when I say this is what I want, because they think I‚Äôm just gonna drop it within a year, which is also discouraging, but motivating too.

On one hand, I'm afraid I won't be able to communicate with the German students in Hannover and make friends, as I've only learned German for half a year and am barely at B1 level. On the other, I'm not sure what the environment is like in RCM, as I heard from my cousin at RAM that some students aren't given enough attention due to favoritism or something like that. (I don't mean to offend RCM students, as I'm just copying what he said.)

  
Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you. "
231,"Solo artists: what's better--your own name, a pseudonym, or a ""band"" name? ",2,musicians,11,"So, I have a pretty common name, and I release music under my own name. It doesn't conform to a specific genre--pop/folk/rock/classical/jazz/soundtrack is the only way to describe it.

To differentiate myself from the zillion other people with my name, I include a middle name. Trouble is, it feels a little stodgy and square, maybe even pretentious, and that's not the vibe I'm going for. It might cause people to not want to listen to it. (It's not that I'm trying to become famous. That ship has sailed, but I'd like to have a little more exposure--who doesn't? I don't gig, so I'm pretty much totally obscure)

Another option--come up with a ""band name"" that is unique and cool (easier said than done). Pros--maybe more people would want to hear my shit. Cons--what about everything I've already released under my own name? It's on all the streaming platforms. Will it be forgotten? Could the potential two names somehow be linked? And could it also be considered pretentious to use a fake name? 

Compare classical music (pretty much 100% using actual names), soundtracks (99% actual names), country (‚âà95% actual names), jazz (‚âà 90% actual names) to pop/rock (maybe 35/65 in favor of stage names).

My stuff takes elements of all the above, so I don't have that to use as a guideline. Anyone have any strong feelings either way?

237,Would anyone be interested in exploring our platform? (platform to help musicians get more listens/follows),0,musicians,5,"Hi there everyone,

I am part of a small startup trying to make a platform that makes it easier for newer, independent artists to grow their fan base and get more listens for their music by offering a marketplace of vetted (guaranteed no bots), more established artists (1,000+ and can go as high as 100,000+ fan base) where you can pay for Features and Promotions from the established artist.

Thanks!

Anticipated Platform Highlights:

* Vetted Artists: Access a selection of handpicked artists by genre, guaranteed bot-free with 1,000+ fans and ranging up to 100,000+. Choose based on your budget.
* Customized Options: View artist profiles for effectiveness ratings, music compatibility, social promotion offerings, availability, pricing, and their average response times (or even schedule a Feature).
* Playlist Integrity Monitoring: Our service will actively monitor releases to identify and flag botted playlists, ensuring your music reaches real listeners. Plus, we handle all communications with platforms like Spotify to maintain the integrity of your music's performance.
* Secure Transactions: Funds and products are held until all parties have met the agreement terms.
* Growth Guarantee: If there's no growth, we refund our commission. You only pay the artist for their work.
* Transparent Ratings: See actual growth rates and successful song features for each artist so you can make informed decisions.

Area we are interested in exploring:

* What are your biggest concerns?
* What are your biggest pain points as far as getting more listens, as an artist?
* What are your biggest objections for a product like this?
* For those of you that have already paid for a Feature before, what were the most time-consuming/annoying parts of the process?
* Issues/complaints about the colors, font, etc.

How much is our commission? How much do Features cost?

TLDR; 10% for our commission (though it's zero if you get no benefit). Features in the industry currently run $200-$500+ (plus commission).

Presently many agencies offer a similar service, but they do so for hundreds to thousands on top of the artist's fee. We're hoping to change this and make this great growth method much more accessible (and streamlined).

Growing as an artist and getting ears on your product so you can grow a dedicated fan base shouldn't be as hard as it currently is. We're looking to change that.

**Summary:**¬†We‚Äôre keen to align our services with artists' needs and avoid any community guideline violations, so we won't post our website link here. If interested, drop a comment with your¬†**genre**, and we‚Äôll reach out with a link. We're rolling out based on genre demand‚Äîso your genre will help us know which genres to roll out to first. This is our second time posting about this, we got taken down before for posting the link."

Ive loved all types of different singing styles over the years, but I want to rock so bad. I thought I had a voice for it but something didn't feel right.

I finally started vocal lessons a few years ago and Ive been practicing and listening to myself sing all types of different styles. But the one that feels the most comfortable for me is folk music üò≠.

I know all I have to do is write folk rock but I'm just pissed off that my voice is meant for that and I'm not made for harsh strong sounds that rock needs. I have a strong powerful sound but it only works properly with the ups and downs folk has and I'm unhappy about it.

Do any other singers have this? Or any one have any advice?

Edit: OK the response from the community here has been incredibly supportive and positive with a lot of good advice. I'm sorry I can't respond to all of you (I don't have the time to type out everything I would want to sayüòÖ). Let me just sum it up and say thank you to everyone!

244,Need help to remedy amp buzz! Is this ground hum?,7,musicians,7,"Buzzing on live sound, potential grounding issue? How to fix?

At my gig earlier today, I have 4 speakers daisy chained and the last one is experiencing buzzing on the live audio, but not on recorded audio. Low volume gig, playing background music for ambiance enhancement. My set up is:

Power
At a convention hall. No wall outlet. Extension cord > power strip > 2 pedals, 3 amps, 1 extension cord to last amp in daisy chain.  for main power. I have the last speaker which is a CoolMusic BP60D (edit: oops, listed this in reverse)

Audio
Instrument > pedals > Eon One MK2 > Eon One MK2 > CoolMusic BP60D amp on stand > Cool Music BP60D on floor (grass/sod) as monitor.

Have switched all cables around, does not resolve buzzing. When the BP60D is unplugged running on its internal battery I'm not hearing a buzz. Buzz exists when volume is on. No buzz when volume is off. 

See pic for set up. A buddy suggested it was a grounding issue and to ditch the power strips. But I don't want to run on battery when I don't have to. I cannot plug in directly to power.

Any ideas on a fix? It's mostly an annoyance. The buzz is not heard on the other 3 speakers that are used for ambiance enhancement, but it is very audible on my monitor. Thank you!"

But sometimes when I'm drifting off to sleep, or when I start daydreaming, a bit of a song will leak out of my subconscious and play in my head. Unlike when I actively recall a song, it will somehow *feel real*, almost like I heard it with my ears rather than my mind.

I downloaded a pitch tracking app out of curiosity. Whenever this happens, I hum what I heard into my phone to see what the notes are, and then I listen to the actual song to see how accurate I was. Most of the time, it's spot on! (Well, within a semitone at least.)

It seems like my brain has the absolute pitch of songs stored inside it somewhere, but I can't access them. They only slip out when I'm half dreaming, completely outside of my control.

I've never heard of something like this before, but I'm really curious. Is this a common thing? Does it have a name? Is it possible to use this to train myself to have perfect pitch?"

I come to you today to share a dilemma I have run into. My following on socials and streaming platforms is very very small, and I don't have any friends in the music industry/pathway or even pursuing music as a hobby, so not really any connections either. 

I'm a solo guitarist that can play guitar to pretty much anything music related, since I've been playing guitar for a couple of years and have good music theory knowledge. I've made and released some of my own songs with guitar in them and REALLY love playing as a solo artist (a.k.a. the skill set is already achieved).

**The problem I have** is that I have never played a single live performance (other than my old high school's annual show) and really want to get myself out there and just enjoy performing for people live, but I have no idea how to even start the process. My town is a relatively small town outside of Atlanta called Johns Creek, and it doesn't really have a huge music scene. I don't even know about any open mics or jams in the area. Everything I have read online is telling me to:

* **Join a band** - but I don't think I have the time or overall commitment for that and enjoy being solo
* **Book a venue** - I have no idea how to get this process even started, and don't know about any in my area
* **Use any musical friend connections** - As I stated before, I'm not in contact with that many people, and none of them are in the music area
* **Use live performance experience** - I have none :( so I can't use that as a way to get anything
* **Play at local bars** - I have no idea if the type of music I'm going for is played in those places

I do plan on adding to my playable material and such while also doing cover songs from artists like **Masayoshi Takanaka** and some solo rock guitarists for these live performances.

If anyone wants a sample/example of my guitar playing or one of my songs, feel free to comment asking for that and I will gladly provide.

In this case, I am literally starting from 0, and don't know how to do anything related to live performances, other than the music itself.

Any help at all is GREATLY APPRECIATED (by me)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

296,Uploading a full music video to Spotify?,1,musicians,0,"I read that Spotify recently rolled out a feature for full music videos last month. Have a music video for my band coming out tomorrow and wanted to see if I can get the full vid (not just ""clips"") on there?

297,Seeking advice: I'm a finalist for a songwriting award and want to capitalize on the publicity,3,musicians,7,"A song of mine made it to the finals of a songwriting competition that gets a good bit of publicity - it's the only song I have out so far. I have 5-6 other songs I could release, and I'm trying to decide how to handle it. I feel like people are going to be looking me up because of the awards (there's also a well-attended awards show I'll perform at in around 2.5 weeks) and I'd like them to have more music to listen to, especially since the rest of my stuff is stylistically quite different from the one song that's out. Should I drop a couple songs ASAP? The day of the event? A week later? Only one song for now and then more singles and an album later? My goals are to increase followers on social media and streaming platforms, increase streams on the one song that's out, and maybe get streams on a new release?

My initial thought was to drop an EP the day of the awards show and announce it at the show, but I've heard people don't really listen to EPs and it's best to do singles and then an album.

I'd love some guidance on what sort of release schedule might make the most of this opportunity. The song that's out is kinda Jack Johnson-esque. The other ones I have ready are folkish, indie rockish, and psych rockish, depending on the song. Thank you so much if you took the time to read all of this."

299,Musicians with bad stage fright. Advice for playing the first time,65,musicians,154,"Hi I‚Äôm 13 and I started playing guitar about a year ago and piano a couple months ago. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm at an amateur level on guitar, I‚Äôm not sure. Anyway the place I‚Äôm taking lessons has like ‚Äúrecitals‚Äùand my grandparents which who are paying for my lessons as well as the employee that schedules lessons wants me to sign up and I said I would talk to my instructor about learning a song and doing the next one. But the thought of that terrifies me. I‚Äôm very anxious and especially socially anxious when the attention is on me or specifically around people my age to the point where I do online school. I know playing in front of people is a must need skill and I want to do it, I think about it often. I did theater when I was younger and though I had a lot of stage fright I still always had other people on stage with me so it‚Äôs much less scary. Not to mention my fears gotten worse so I guess I‚Äôm just asking if anyone else with bad stage fright or anxiety has any advice for playing the first time? I‚Äôve always had this mindset of not showing people stuff until you know you‚Äôre really good and though I‚Äôm progressing, I‚Äôm not great. Also does anyone know what it might be like? I‚Äôm taking lessons at gc. Thanks.

  
Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented didn‚Äôt expect this much. A lot of very useful tips that have definitely made it seem much less scary. I have another question just in case someone sees this, i live in Wa and the music scene in the part I live In is pretty bad. I mean I don‚Äôt know much but I know there‚Äôs really not much going on here. So I was just wondering how anyone else with similar experience approached finding places to play/ open mics. Just a question for the future:)"
300,Music project Sydney Australia ,1,musicians,2,Looking for sydney Australia üá¶üá∫ musos to collaborate and potentially launch a band that books gigs weekly or fortnightly - I'm struggling as im a lead vocalist and no accompanying musos yet.... my friend has regular gigs and good contacts but I'm not getting traction yet..

I hope there's something we can all do to band together against this injustice. I think ai companies should be forced to pay artists that have had their music ripped for the sake of making an ai song. These ai models are just code and the code leaves an unbiased digital trail. Royalties can certainly be traced this way. The corporations need to be held accountable and the artists, who are unknowingly being used to help produce these songs, need to be compensated. 

Also let's cool it down on making fun of JoJo Siwa. It's even hurting my feelings at this point.

308,Does location/city you are in make/break the chances of being in a successful band?,6,musicians,12,"Obviously there is a lot to unpack from the title, like you can get to work and make any band of your liking with anyone around you, what does it mean to be ""successful,"" isn't having fun all that matters, etc. But I'm sure the question is fair at face value.

I'm in Buffalo, NY. We definitely had some hits. Goo Goo Dolls, 10,000 Maniacs, Cannibal Corpse, Every Time I Die, Snapcase. Obv not every diy band is going to make it out of the rest, I would consider even 1/10th the success as the aforementioned bands as success. Even if there is great value to just being a part of a scene, whether or not your music lives or grows outside of local shows, I still feel like many people don't have the drive that I see in other cities and other scenes that get bands touring and eventually headlining.

There are the no-duh places out there like NYC, LA, Chicago, Philly. But also Richmond, Providence, Pittsburgh, San Antonio all seem to be much greater hubs to find people who are willing to be dropouts and live out a band and have fun. A lot of rust belt cities seem to enjoy the band stuff on the weekends as a night out but the drive really stops there. Idk. Maybe it's just me, but I feel like after my first band or two here I may well just pack my things and go to another scene where there is a better chance at finding people who want to give it their all."

i know the first step is to have good music, aka music im genuinely proud of but sometimes even good content doesnt get engagement if its hidden or if people just havebt built a connection to the person posting or so. but i also dont want to make myself seem too accessible to people so i dont want to be too casual and overshare in my posting on social media or make everyone feel like theyre my friend - i want to maintain a professional distance a) to make sure there are no problems later on down the line where i feel like i have to maintain all these people or have overly familiar listeners and b) make sure the people who like my work especially at the start like my work for the actual work itself and arent just engaging out of obligation or so

im sure i contradicted myself a couple of times but im just trying to loosely debate this in my head and thought doing so with some input could be insightful

maybe im not at a point where i should be worrying about things like professional distance and should just max out every sort of interaction or chance for someone to support me that i could get but idk i have faith that another way or even multiple routes are possible. also if youre a musician who lands gigs or considers yourself to have achieved some goals when it comes to listeners and wouldnt mind sharing how that worked for you please do! i'd appreciate hearing some evidence of how it can work out in non traditional (or traditional!) ways

But the reality is- making a living on music is really a minority position and can take lots of luck and things coming together to pull it off...

More practically you could do music adjacent businesses like teaching music- but then at that point for some- a normal job might simply provide way more stability and financial security.

 I am the lead singer, I write all the lyrics, and most of the guitar, and bass parts. I also do all the art for merch and fliers and social media stuff, as well as our booking. Now you might be thinking I‚Äôm a control freak, and while I do have my own vision of what the band should be, I CONSTANTLY ask other members to take on some of these responsibilities or to give me meaningful feedback. I always either send mock ups of the art, conversations with organizers, or WIPs of the songs that I‚Äôm writing and ask what they think. And they either straight up don‚Äôt give me a response or give me vague critiques like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it‚Äù or my favorite ‚Äúmy opinion is nebulous‚Äù. I‚Äôve asked them to help me write riffs, make their own merch designs, or to help out with logistics ect. But then in return, they get upset with me when the output is not what they imagined or I make creative decisions on my own. And the few times that they have stepped up to do something they expect that what they make will absolutely not be criticized in any way. 

I told them that essentially I can‚Äôt read their mind, and if they want more of a say, they can take up more responsibilities and use clearer communication. But that was brushed under the rug, do I quit? Or do I figure something out."

We've been booked as the band for a TED-talk in our hometown. When we agreed on this gig it's been said there was full technical service (FOH, mixer, PA, etc). No fixed payment but a tip jar plus a follow-up interview on the local radio show. This was months ago. 
Even though we've asked multiple times, it was only a couple of days before the gig until we got contacted by the ""sound guy"". That guy is actually a DJ and has little to no experience in mixing Bands, neither does he have a console, mics or anything else. 

Right now, it looks like we'll have to bring everything by ourselves except for the PA. We've discussed this within the band and decided we'll play the gig for tips, but we'll charge a flat fee for the technical equipment (mics, mixing console, etc). If the organizer refuses to pay, we're not gonna play.

Is this justified, reasonable behaviour in your eyes? How would you handle such a situation?"

369,Need musicians for university project!! ,0,musicians,1,"Hiiiiii

I'm F23 studying a remote part time university of music production to achieve my dream to became a music producers. For a project I have to create a couple of original tracks with the collaborations of musicians.

Unfortunately as a anti-social persone i don't know anyone that play an instrument that could help me. I ask to friends of my friends that  at the beginning accepted but then refuse cause to busy so I hoped I could find some help here. 

I ideally need to create a song in jazz fusion style and I would like for it someone that play guitar that could play a simple jazzy sample where I can work on. 

The second idea is create a song in style Bjork, where I would love a clarinet or something similar, to imitate her genre. 


If someone is happy to help me out I would be extremely glad!

370,Playing by ear but not understanding what I'm playing,13,musicians,30,"TLDR: I'm an amateur player but I can play by ear pretty well on guitar (my friend say I have relatively perfect pitch) but I never know what notes I'm playing or what key which makes me feel stagnant.  


So for context, I had basic musical training when I was a kid (reading notes, learning keys and scales) but that's pretty much the extent of my formal training. I started with piano and learned guitar and then went to boarding school, so I couldn't get the instruction I was receiving anymore. 

My mum noticed pretty early that if I heard a song, I could fairly match the basic melody on the piano if I heard it enough times. Since then and now in my young adulthood, I've become more of a guitar enthusiast, and over the years, I can say that most of the time now,  if a song is playing, I can pick up the melody (and sometimes harmonize) in a couple seconds while it's being played. The main issue is I don't know how. 

I have no idea what notes I'm playing most of the time unless I actually try and pay attention to my finger position (which is hard to do if you're trying to match something on the fly). I can't explain to people how it happens but it just feels like if I can hear the song in my head, I can try to guess/predict where the next note will be. I'm grateful for the ability to do this but I'm also deeply frustrated by it sometimes because I would like to know what I'm playing. I would love to be able to identify what key I'm in, and even go up a level by figuring out what chords to play for the song rather than just the basic melody. However, I feel stuck and unsure of how to proceed from here (I'm also not in the position to get lessons because I'm a broke college student :( . If you guys have any tips or thoughts regarding any of this, I would greatly appreciate it!"

375,Guitar signal cutting out when using Behringer UMC204HD and Tonocracy,1,musicians,1," 

I prefer to use amp simulators to real amplifiers when playing guitar, as I can get a wider range of tones with amp simulators and can record my practice more easily. However, I'm having a problem with the sustain. I'm currently practicing vibrato exercises using a metronome. I've noticed that the guitar(I have a squire strat) cuts out sharply after it gets under a certain volume. At first I thought it was a guitar issue, however after playing around with turning up the gain on my audio interface, I noticed that I got more sustain(however the signal started distorting very badly). Does anyone have any idea what the underlying issue causing the lack of sustain and what I can do to help get more sustain.

Thanks"

they use me as a weapon 
infinite destinations 
will i ever make it to heaven ?

fuck the inflation 
how we gonna live eating off pavements 
i wanted to pave my life not play it 
if you believe in it you‚Äôll make it

don‚Äôt just sit there and fake it 
your mind moves at a quicker paste 
so much to waste not enough to take 

the love i project comes from deep 
i‚Äôll be in the streets peaking from md 
this feeling don‚Äôt keep 
temporary feelings when i‚Äôm at my peak 

tryna go to the peaks 
take a lil peek at the beautiful scenery 
but that‚Äôs not all it seems to me 
the leaves and the trees are all linked to us

the sky will fall from above us 
no i never thought ill make it on a tour bus 
selling tickets to make the stage floor bust

that‚Äôs my time that i must 
i feel so strongly about making music i love 
give it to people hope they lend their ears

the fog returns and so does the chaos

who you were in the past?

i‚Äôm always coming in last 
i put myself to the test 
yet i‚Äôd fall down like the rest
just want some place to nest
yeah i‚Äôm not feeling the best 

uncomfortable in my skin 
save my money for my next of kin 
when i do these drugs know it‚Äôs a sin
does anyone ever win?
is this life just a mission we‚Äôre in 
i wish we were free 
free to be what we wanna be 

obsessed with drugs
obsessed with love 
i just wanna kick 
my feet up in the dark 
lighters up in the park  
how im feeling so far 
is like i‚Äôve come from a far 
shining in the sky just like a shooting star 
life never seems to go that far

383,I was in a lame band. Just threw out any memory I had. ,0,musicians,24,"I think it‚Äôs important to get rid of reminders. I realize that it‚Äôs better to let it go and forget about it. Any memory is a reminder that I didn‚Äôt get anywhere any my life has been pointless ever since. I had posters and framed albums throughout my house. They are now in the trash where they belong. Why would I want reminders of my failure? We were one of the emo bands on Victory Records in the early 2000s. I never found a proper backup plan if the band failed. So now I‚Äôm 40. poor as fuck. Hate my career. Just a nobody that never achieved shit. The only thing people remember about me is a horrible tragedy. That‚Äôs the only thing on the internet when you seek me out. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm known for. 

Either you make it as an artist or you find a way to make it in society. I failed at both. I can‚Äôt climb out of it. I would need to go back to school for a minimum of 3 years for a PhD or something similar. A gamble. Especially with my mental health. I never should‚Äôve done the band thing because I‚Äôm so far behind now. I recommend you go to school. Get logical degrees. And stop pretending you will make a career from music. You have to be so unbelievably great to gain an audience. I am just one example. I deeply regret the choices I made and wish I had never picked up music. It has been nothing but a curse. 

Can‚Äôt wait for the replies of people telling me I‚Äôm a piece of shit for saying anything and I should simply be grateful I did anything with music. "

397,Ex husband has ruined me in the local musical community ,273,musicians,334,"Hoping for some actual help here and not angry or passive aggressive responses please. 

My ex left our family abruptly a little over a year ago. We are both musicians and in fact that is how we met originally. 

When he first left, since he totally disassociated he was free to play open mics and establish himself in the local community by playing every single night while I dealt with all the responsibilities of our home, daughter, pets, finances, not to mention the deep depression of having someone you love for 11 years walk out on your family. 

I played a few open mics here and there to get my creative juices flowing again. And I found a good community near my home which was a bit far from him. But then he started going there as well. Since he did so, and since I can't get out as frequently as he does because all the responsibilities were left on me, he ruined the few friendships I had established.

He is everywhere, knows everyone now. And I've begged him to please talk this out as I am completely alienated. He seems to be enjoying the control. I didn't cheat or anything- in fact he did. And he abandoned his step daughter of 11 years. But I have been the one dealing with the backlash. 

How do I get back out there knowing the music community is a tight arena and I don't want anyone caught up in this mess? Especially since he's completely taken over the local scene? I really need some help. We're all musicians here, without this outlet and opportunity to even make friends that are musicians I am so isolated. I need a way back in knowing he won't even remotely give an inch. "

417,How can I approach my band and tell them it‚Äôs good to play venues that aren‚Äôt houses or backyards ,50,musicians,58,"I‚Äôm (28, male, drummer) in a band that I love. I love our music and I like the guys that I‚Äôm playing with. We‚Äôve got music released this year, more on the way, and we‚Äôve been playing a lot this year. 

The other guys in my group are 21, 20, and 19. 
A lot of their friends are under 21. 
An issue with our shows is that they want their friends to come in and watch us, which happens when we do backyard shows, but it‚Äôs more difficult when it‚Äôs at a bar. 

We just played a show at a bar, and one of the guys said that he doesn‚Äôt want to play there anymore because his girlfriend (age 19) can‚Äôt be inside watching us. 

I understand where they‚Äôre coming from, but in my opinion, it‚Äôs important for us to play to people that aren‚Äôt just our friends and peer group, we should play to as many different audiences as possible, and venues and bars are some of the best places to do that. 

I‚Äôve expressed this to them before but, they still don‚Äôt like the fact that bars and venues have age restrictions. 

What can I do more to let them know that it‚Äôs important for us to grow by stepping out of our comfort zone and playing for ‚Äúgrown ups‚Äù and strangers? "

It's not severe enough to cause pain, but it's definitely annoying and happens once or twice a few weeks, particularly when I'm tired.

I'm wondering if this is something I should be concerned about? It's not debilitating, but it does make me wonder if it's a sign of something more serious lurking beneath the surface.

426,Tips for writing lyrics/exercising lyric writing muscle?,3,musicians,3,"Have been a musician for most of my life. I play keys and guitar in a variety of genres, though I mostly dabble with Latin styles (Cumbia, ranchera, bolero), r&b, and rock. I love collaborating music writing with other people, but would love to make my own independent songs as well.

There are many songs I have written with a fleshed out form, harmony, bass, and melody, but I‚Äôve been sitting on for years because the threshold for me to lay down lyrics is so incredibly high. Coming up with musical motifs is second nature to me, but once I start writing lyrics, I hate them almost immediately, and then I stop altogether for months at a time.

Does anyone have any tips for writing or drafting lyrics in a systematic way? I feel like I need a system to get through lyric writing or I‚Äôll be always stuck.

432,Tony Kanal's bass tone at Coachella,1,musicians,4,"Personally I think I sounds horrid. I am watching on stream, but anything above the lowest octave on the instrument sounds like a cheap bass being pushed too hard through little cheap Ampeg combo. The rest of the mix sounds good, so I'm assuming it's on the performer's side and that is the intentional sound being produced.

I'm aware of a certain desired tone/sound especially for the more ska, punk, and reggae influenced sounds, but it's so obtrusive in the mix. I'd def chill on those low-mids that sound like their being pushed really hard on the performer side of the gain staging.

I'm curious what others who have watched the stream think about that choice of tone, or if you think it's something lost in translation due the stream mix. Obviously this just my opinion but I'd love to hear what other musicians think about it and if my judgement on the tone is misplaced or not.

Note: I mixed live sound (primarily rock, punk, ska, reggae, metal, etc.) for about 8 years. Also, I have a friend (non-musician) working the festival who says it's probably the stream mix."

442,Seeking Advice As Solo Artist ,1,musicians,19,"Hi everyone :) 

I‚Äôm looking for some advice and thought maybe some users here would have insight.  I just released my very first single. I‚Äôve pasted links below for Apple Music and Spotify. 

I have five other songs that have been produced and just need to be mixed and mastered. 

But I don‚Äôt really know which direction to go‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt foresee myself spending hours a day on social media, curating content. 

But I also don‚Äôt see myself going out and playing covers in bars every night. 

To be clear, I‚Äôm happy to play live. I‚Äôd just like to do so in an intentional setting. 

I‚Äôd really like to attract the attention of a record label that shared enthusiasm in my work and such. But I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs how the cookie crumbles nowadays. Any ideas? 

Edit: my focus with this post is to try and hear NEW IDEAS. I agree 100% that the standard avenues today are to gig and put content online. 

Here‚Äôs a few suggestions I‚Äôve heard in the past and in these comments: 

‚Ä¢ entering singer/songwriter competitions 

‚Ä¢ attending music conferences with a music portfolio 

‚Ä¢ create a schedule of open mics in your area and do those weekly

‚Ä¢ dedicating extra funds to booking agents, social media management, etc. 

In the not-so-distant past, people who marketed themselves online were laughed at. Now, it‚Äôs the only way. Does it seem possible that in the future, there may be alternative routes for attracting an audience?

443,Musician unspoken rules/etiquette question,36,musicians,46,"About 10 years ago I had a band with a few close friends. We've since faded, but still have each other on social media and whatnot, we haven't caught up in years but are still on good terms.

When we used to jam, my buddy had this warmup riff he used to play that I LOVED. I don't think he ever did anything with it, or if he even remembers it at this point. I'd love to use it as a song intro, but I'm not sure if it's appropriate to ask him if I can have it or not. What do you guys think?"
444,Getting paid...,12,musicians,43,"So I've always wondered how else this works around the world but I wanna talk about unsigned bands getting paid. Here in the UK, mostly when you start out, it's very rare to get paid for a show. Here there's a lot of door deals, where a venue give you a cut of the money from the people that came to the venue to see you specifically. Obviously no one knows who you are, and getting just a small handful of friends can be very difficult if it's a crappy day of the week and you don't play until 10pm.

I've always thought about it this way, a venue needs to make money, if you don't bring anyone then no money is going over the bar and the venue are losing money with staff and running costs. It's the music BUSINESS, so if you can't make any money for the venue, then why should they give you anything?

But let's have a healthy debate over this...how does it work in your part of the world?

445,Who are the best truly solo artists?,4,musicians,11,"I think my problem as a solo singer songwriter is that I've been trying to interpret my 'full band rock song' style songs on stage as a solo singer songwriter. It just ends up sounding incomplete somehow when played live. 

So... I'm thinking like... when Richard Dawson or Jake Xerxes Fussell play live, it doesn't sound like it's missing anything. It sounds like it's *supposed* to be played solo - one guitar, one voice, even when - in the case of RD - it's climactic and loud and almost metallic sounding.

Even Elliott Smith, or Junior Brother, who has been recommended to be off the back of loving Richard Dawson's work, augments his live shows with other musicians.

I want to be influenced by music which is authentic, idiosyncratic, and sounds like it was supposed to be played by one person and a guitar. 

I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me some artists to draw influence from. No particular genre, but preferably not Jeff Buckley or that type of thing.

Who should I look up? Thanks folks! "

I'm getting a great discount/deal and even offered to pay more for faster timelines but he assured me he would get it back to me. I have been very gracious and accommodating and made the mistake of saying ""no more timelines"" one day because I didn't want anyone to feel pressured.

Mikkey Dee is the MVP here, killer playing, killer writing and killer drummung. Especially during the solo, which was quite common when he had joined motorhead, especially in bastards and sacrifice. Phil is great at his job too.

Lemmy seems to be on some good goodamn intense high, vocals are as hellish as they have gotten in motorhead. The bass is at the peak of distortion, mostly complements the guitar on this one. 4 minutes and makes the body sore as hell.

Only challenge is the intensity of the song, one of the most intense songs I have covered. Figured out the tabs by ears.

I am planning my wedding for this coming June. My wife (we got married - just couldn't afford the wedding until now) has played violin for almost 10 years and one of her only requests during early planning was to have live violin during our ceremony. 

Due to some unexpected issues with finding a venue, we haven't been able to start looking for a lot of our vendors until recently, including ceremony musicians. Most musicians we've reached out to have been unavailable, so we started reaching out to people we knew, friends of friends, etc. 

My sister's roommate volunteered to play. I asked my sister for her contact information and if she has a rate that she already charges. My sister is majorly busy (engineering student), so I haven't heard back from her. We are requesting she play a specific song for the walk. She would be playing for 1-2 hours. She would also be invited to attend the reception as guest (if she wants) if that changes anything.  I want to be able to to properly budget for paying my sister's roommate and was wondering what people would recommend as a rate for this. 

Thanks in advance!"

Later when my brain comes back I‚Äôll go do something fun on bass - and tomorrow deal with *just* the two songs that my band leader pointed out after the last show, and not every other thing that was wrong when I watched the video back.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
What do you do on those days when you need to work on your playing, but every little mistake just feeds into the ‚ÄúI suck, how did I ever think I could go pro with this, if I haven‚Äôt gotten *this*(details in a second) by now, how will I ever get it‚Ä¶‚Äù 

I‚Äôm on meds for my depression, stuck with female plumbing so hormone whackiness may be exacerbating things‚Ä¶ but I need to practice, I can‚Äôt just wallow in negativity. We‚Äôve got band practice on monday and I need to have a couple tunes down by then. They‚Äôre not that hard, but I need to woodshed on them.

I always wonder if I‚Äôm expecting too much from myself‚Ä¶ I joined this band 6 months ago. We‚Äôve got some 60+ songs in the repertoire, no charts on stage, and the band leader wants to be a grateful dead style ‚Äòno set lists‚Äô on stage. I play bass, and it‚Äôs folky stuff (so no crazy Geddy Lee level bass lines)‚Ä¶ but am I crazy to try to expect to have all these arrangements memorized by now? This is my first dive into being a full time musician, with a local band that‚Äôs *just* starting to break out nationally.

Trying to find a house and move states definitely hampered my practice time the last 3 months‚Ä¶ but this band is my job - it‚Äôs my responsibility to have my shit together. It was a little easier in November/December because we were playing or practicing once or twice a week. Along with moving, we‚Äôve only had 2 gigs a month in feb/march/april, and I haven‚Äôt been practicing with the band leader at all. All the band practice has been on-boarding the new fiddler or working on studio prep for our first album.

If you got this far in the weeds - thanks for reading. I‚Äôm posting this from my ‚Äòanonymous‚Äô account so no - I won‚Äôt give further info on the band or our location."
490,Help with changing music score,1,musicians,1,"Hello, I would be very grateful if someone could help me with this. I have a piece of music for the piano as part of a band for a show but the music is really horrible to read and I need to learn it quite quickly. Here are pictures of the score and you can see all the double flats where surely it could be written in an easier way by changing the key signature but keeping the same notes so that for example a D double flat would be written as a normal C (C natural)? Is this possible? If anyone can help me with this either telling me how to do it or doing it for me that would be so helpful thank you!

491,Question about Clapton playing style,1,musicians,1,"I've never been a big fan - always found him predictable and boring. But I was intrigued enough by a YouTube short title (something about him showing some speed) to watch, and I was quite amazed to see that his whole lead was just using the 1st and 2nd fingers of his fretting (left) hand. I was wondering if this has always been his ""technique"" or if he was compensating for some sort of injury for this specific performance. Clapton fans - is this how he always does it?"

493,"My sightreading has been crippled, and i think it‚Äôs because i have vision problems. Anyone else have this experience, and did glasses help? How?",2,musicians,6,"I‚Äôve never considered myself a particularly good sightreader. I‚Äôve gotten much better over the years, but this past year or so, more and more, it‚Äôs been getting worse. Not in the way that my skills are degenerating, but I‚Äôm having new issues.

For example:

I‚Äôm reading notes as if they are a step or so off from where they actually are. I see a note, and i can play the note that my eyes think it is automatically, but i look closer and it‚Äôs not the note i SAW it as. 

Lots of ink can mean i can‚Äôt decipher anything. My actual rhythm literacy is just fine, but everything just melds together when i see it too close together on the page. This goes for rhythm, for a ton of accidentals, whatever else.

In addition, things like noticing myself sitting much closer to my music, leaning in more during more complex passages, and writing marks in my music noticeably larger, darker, and more frequent than my stand partners and neighbors all make me convinced that I do indeed have problems with my vision.

Has anyone else had this problem? Was it because of bad vision? Did you notice a significant improvement in sightreading ability or general comprehension once you got glasses? 



TL,DR: I misread notes, lots of ink means i can‚Äôt see, and i sit closer and add more and bigger marks to my music. I think i have vision problems that are crippling my sightreading. has anyone else dealt with this?

494,we need a new platform. NOW!,28,musicians,20,"myspace would give you 100 listeners in a week without any promotion. Soundcloud 5 months ago did the same. But today, if you don't promote your own music, it won't get any listeners anywhere. 

Distribution platforms just want your money and won't promote you at all.

There's no platforms for new listeners to go after new music.

If you're an artist on spotify you don't even know the people that listen to you. You don't have a way to connect with your audience!

I'm not saying you don't need to promote your music. I'm just saying there's no platform that will at least make you be heard if you don't go around posting some links. And this is not  good!

I don't know about you guys, but all my friends only discover new music on spotify. Not sometimes on soundcloud, sometimes on youtube, ONLY on spotify.

There's no mail list, no liking or replying comments from fans, no way to make your audience feel like they are part of a group.

521,"Going (semi-)professional vs anxiety, how to deal with it?",1,musicians,8,"Short version:

I have (in the past) blown off an opportunity to live out a part of my dream to make a living playing guitar, due to anxiety and stress. I have another opportunity now. I'm forcing myself to go thru the motions this time, but just thinking about memorizing 50 songs, playing 'good' on stage, stage presence, social aspect.. makes me weak. 

---Tips on how to deal or work with this anxiety?   
Stories of your experiences of making the switch from amateur endless-repetition bands to (semi-)professional musician life?



[Long version, extra info and blabbering]

So I've been playing guitar for a long time and one of my old bands' bandmembers, has since gone 'professional'. Also, since then he has forwarded or recommended me to similar bands 'in his scene' at least twice (he's such a great friend and bro for that and I feel like such opportunities really are not be wasted.. but I know I'm a guy that wastes opportunities..). 

These bands are regional party-cover bands that play 2-3x a week for ~1k to ~3k people.

I just can't seem to take the plunge, my heartbeat goes wild just thinking about it (being on stage for large crowd, being expected to sound good -to drunk crowds but also bandmembers and mostly myself probably-, I'm not much on the social part and as a non-alcoholic don't enjoy staying around long after jams or shows).

I am a more technically developed guitarist than my friend (I am a practice nerd but to be fair I also started playing the instrument years before he did), but his confidence and trust in me is much bigger than I have for myself. I make up a million excuses for why I couldn't do it, or imagine myself on stage and somehow my stomach churns and I think I'll do bad or something? I know I can play okay on the guitar, but I suffer hard from the imposter-syndrome ish thoughts and often project my insecurities in imaginary future situations.. I hope you get the point.

I feel like the cliche where at this point the biggest thing holding me back from achieving my dreams, is me lol. 

---How do you know if you can do it?

525,How do you approach booking gigs for your band?,2,musicians,12,"After years of playing in bands for other guys, I finally started my band about a year ago. We‚Äôre playing original songs which I wrote myself and then taught all my friends (bandmates) how to play.

We‚Äôre practiced enough now to the point now where we‚Äôre show-ready and have our first single ready for release but since it‚Äôs sort of ‚Äúmy band‚Äù I‚Äôm more or less responsible for reaching out and getting us gigs.  In previous bands, it was usually a different guy in the band handling all of the booking stuff and I would just show up and play.  

Do you reach out to the promoters? The venue? Bands playing a specific show? Are there any secret techniques for getting cool opportunities and not playing five hour long sets of bar covers?

528,Is it good to give out second chances to guys who burned bridges with you in previous projects?,16,musicians,55,"The reason I ask is because this drummer got back in touch with me. The way he left was really bad. He accused me of stealing ""his drum ideas"" for songs I had already written before I met the dude. He didn't have nice things to say about me when we parted ways. He said I was wasting his time. But he apologized to me recently and im a firm believer in forgiving people. 

It's just drumming is nothing I can't do and im not sure the guy deserves another shot. Even if I forgive him. The point is he might think if he decides to leave again that the music belongs to him or something. It really doesn't. My music is very guitar driven with some room for spicing things up on the kit. But drumming can always be redone or altered. I didn't steal a song I wrote before I met this drummer. It was already my original work. Anyways, do we jam or should I forget about it?"
529,Need help understanding the needs of musicians,0,musicians,10,"Hey guys,

i could use your help understanding the needs and wants of musicians.

As a student project i need to design a physical product for musicians. It will be sold by a record label but can really be anything you could use or need as a musician.

As i like to listen to music, but have never had any close contact with people that actually make music, i would like to know ~~what do you expect from a record label when creating a song or an album?~~

What problems do you encounter during the production of music?

What problems do you encounter when performing on the stage?

It would be nice if you could also include what kind of music you make.

From this post i hope to get a feeling for the problems that exist within the music industry. Any help is appreciated.



Thanks :)

  
Edit: 

Its not like the label would force you to buy their product. The goal is to expand the brand into a direction that allows them to also sell physical products, so maybe focus on the questions about what problems you encounter when producing or performing music."

532,Looking for keyboard rig recommendations,1,musicians,5,"Hey all :)

So I'm a semi professional keyboardist, my current rig consists of a Roland JDX-i 37 keys and a Yamaha P-125 88 key. I currently play in a metal band and in a wedding band. 

The metal band is mostly originals and just a few covers, where I'd need mostly a good strings, choir, strong church organ and ocassionally some electronic stuff. A good guitar like sound (jordan rudess style) would be very useful. 

In the wedding band we mostly play pop and rock songs but I need the synth quite a lot for that and sometimes it's difficult to get the sound I want, not that I can't edit it but I need to be able to access these sounds quickly and easily really. 

Im looking to upgrade mostly as I feel the sounds I have just aren't that good and the roland jdxi means it takes me a while to switch sounds sometimes. Ive checked how to save sounds to favourites on the roland but, honestly, it's pretty buggy. I had the Novation mini nova before and although the sounds were a bit too weird, the sounds were much easier to access quickly. 

Im tempted to try a midi keyboard where I can load the sounds but a laptop during a live show worries me cause what if it crashes or something so I'm a bit skeptical about that.

Im open to any suggestions from more experienced people perhaps, really appreciate any feedback or suggestions you've got :) "

535,Setlist anxiety/hesitation (singer),1,musicians,3,"So I'm doing my first longer performance/tour de force of four songs. I'm getting serious anxiety over my chosen songs. I'm worried that they aren't the best that I could have chosen. Two of the songs I love, and really want to sing them. But the other two I'm not so sure about. It's not like I'm worried that I can do them technically, I'm more concerned about not being able to perform them comfortably interpretation-wise. Like If I start to feel embarrassed about their overly vulnerable and romantic lyrics, or if the songs are too slow in rhythm and people start  to lose interest in the midst. I should send my sheets to the piano player like yesterday so this is the literal last chance to change anything. I'm not sure if it will be worth it to me to harrass my teacher and piano player with last minute changes, on the other hand, this is my opportunity. Am I overthinking? Is it more important to stick to the choices?  Have y'all been comfortable with all of your songs or do you take it as part of the experience if your choices were less than ideal?

I asked if I could take the moldings they made and shop around for different plugs since the audiologist was only selling that one brand for that much, but the doc said if I bought online there's no quality assurance, whereas with her I'll come back and she'll do a leak-test.

541,Further Your Art: Use AI ‚â† Fear AI,0,musicians,50,"Hi!

EDIT&TLDR: View AI as another paintbrush or as a new form of keyboard‚Ä¶AI in and of itself is no more art than a paintbrush, in desperate need of a painter to steady it‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

What started out as a rant against those who are afraid of AI in the arts, evolved into a tip that I believe will help many of you who are concerned: using AI to further your compositions. 

Any great artist knows that exposure and reference are huge assets (primarily in developing talent) but also in becoming inspired. Instead of viewing AI as a never ending source of soulless music - view it as the next evolution of iTunes; the Record Shop; the Library; the Opera House; simply a place to find new ideas

Imagine you have an idea in your head. You type it into Youtube to try and find something similar but alas, to no avail. Instead, take it into something such as SUNO. Knowing how AI works, it is fair to assume this is an amalgamation of existing compositions. So generate your prompt. BUT don‚Äôt stop there! Bring that piece into your DAW or transcribe it. Rewrite the melody. Sample it into a new beat. Deconstruct the harmony and harmonize against it. Take the melody and write new lyrics. A prompt isn‚Äôt yours. MAKE IT YOURS. 


Look, i know it‚Äôs easy to think that this is uncharted territory. But it‚Äôs not. Humans have innovated since time immemorial. Make it your tool. Don‚Äôt become it‚Äôs b*tch. 

Happy Hunting

542,Upcoming audition ,2,musicians,6,"Hi I'm a clarinet player I'm going to a university next week for an audition for get into their music school. I'm really worried because on of the prepared pieces I have to play is in cut time and my teacher recommended I try to play it at 160bpm in fast four. I've not been practicing as much as I should have I admit but every time I practice I feel like I get worse and I miss notes and rhythms I shouldn't.

I tried to major in music before and I quit bc of the stress and I lost all of my confidence I barely played my instrument for a while and I really want to get into this school but they're really well known and a lot of people want to be there.

What can I do to be as best as I can by next week?"
543,Best way to get gigs as an acoustics live looping artist?,7,musicians,22,"I‚Äôve got 60 solid cover tunes, killer rig, pa, lighting, YouTube page, FB page. Now I just need gigs, and they seem really hard to come by. Maybe I‚Äôm going about it wrong? 

Some venues I drop off a card to the bar staff (booking person never seems to be available) and other venues I‚Äôve emailed (about 40 in 3 months) which I never get replies. I do have a couple gigs lined up from doing the things listed, but the ratio is pretty discouraging. 

Is it a bad idea to follow up the emails with maybe a FB message, or a call? I‚Äôd hate to pester managers or bar staff, but it seems like I‚Äôm spinning my wheels. 

Is it necessary to show face at the venues and just keep asking and just bide my time? Some gigs lead to more gigs kinda thing? I know I can‚Äôt expect to take over the local music scene overnight, maybe patience is the biggest thing here. Any kind of input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. "

**Advice needed!!!!**

So, picture this: I've ( 27 F) been serenading shower walls and kitchen utensils forever. My love for music? It's been there like a loyal sidekick. But then life happened, and I ended up majoring in something that promised more cash flow than melody. Now that I am a little more settled and have some money to invest in my musical interest, I want to keep pursuing music.

I've decided it's time to reignite the musical flame within me, but I need your help, oh wise ones of the musical realm! I'm looking to invest more into my musical abilities, with dreams of teaching music to kids and maybe even gracing more stages with my presence. **But where do I start?**

Group lessons seem like a solid first step, but beyond that, I'm navigating uncharted territory. So, fellow musicians, teachers, and music aficionados hit me with your best advice! **Whether it's tips for finding the perfect vocal coach, recommendations for getting involved in the local music scene, or pearls of wisdom for aspiring music educators, I'm all ears (and vocal cords)!

570,"Talent does matter, personality just matters more.",132,musicians,104,"I've seen so many posts about people complaining that their music is not making it, yet they do 0 PR, Don't invest in a manager, don't build a brand and image. Don't actually engage with fans, ect. One of my biggest lessons was to start taking myself seriously as an artist and stop just dropping on Bandlab and Snapchat with a song I made in a day posting it on my story and calling it good.

I have no tik tok, do not even know what a PR firm is or does, have no marketing plan, no costumes, no videos, no plans to do live performance 

why did I expect to ever blow up? 

From now on i plan to take songs slow 100s of takes if I have to, only make music that actually means something to me emotionally, and actually pay for stems send projects to professionals to get mixed, have a marketing and roll out plan. I hate even making this post instead of just doing it but I feel like it needs to be said and maybe actualizing it into words is good.

sometimes I feel like leaving this reddit because of all the sad people who want to be famous and the lack of actual creative conversation. 

It sounds weird but maybe because you want to blow up, you're making music for it to be received well rather than truly expressing yourself and that hides the uniqueness that you could be bringing to music.

Yeah that rapper kinda sucks and has millions but he also is himself and took his music and art seriously and went and learned the professional route to producing and marketing a record.

Even your favorite great artists or underground artists, they didn't get traction until they got professional help in some shape or form and they invested thousands and thousands into even the earliest records

Get references, and inspiration, plan hard and invest into a more professional route, to the rappers out there, even Kanye has to have his beats go through multiple people and levels of mastering 

Take yourself and the art seriously to the most meticulous level of expression,  produce records that actually mean something deeply to YOU, and Invest into professional help and knowledge to get them out to the world and I guarantee you wouldn't be on Reddit complaining about others making it."

I have a wedding coming up. It'll be pretty small, and I found a song that I'm in love with that I think would sound amazing with a singer with a guitar/ukulele singing it. It's Rather Be Me (With You) from Steven Universe if you're curious. 

The song is only a little over a minute long, I'd probably want the song to be sung a little slower and maybe just have the instrumental playing until I walk all the way down. 

Ofc the ceremony will be probably no longer than 20 min. How much do you think that'll cost? 

I'm in Austin, TX if that matters. 

Thanks!"
577,Rant: I'm a longtime musician whose struggling not to hate even the very concept of music anymore,66,musicians,231,"So I've been playing music my whole life, and guitar especially since I was in middle school. I've loved it and enjoyed it my whole life. Music has been a major part of who I am. I've played for fun, played gigs for money, played just for the sake of it, etc. I enjoy all genres, country, math rock, metal, gospel, everything. I just loved music.

Writing music has always been my favorite part of music, and composition is the main driver for why I have continued to play. I can't listen to songs without ""hearing"" new parts, so as a result I've never really listened to much music, plus I get more obsessed with whatever new earworm popped into my head. Moreover, I sing my own made up melodies in church (we do acapella only) since I can express the music I feel like should be. I can't even walk around without getting my own made up melodies stuck in my head, and the only cure has always been to learn the part on an instrument. As a result, I've made a lot of great songs, some fading into obscurity and some gaining some traction, though I only ever did it for its own sake rather than that it would be appreciated--like if a song I kept hearing against my will didn't exist and I didn't actualize it then it felt almost like the world was not right and thus I must actualize it. Music has become such apart of my life, my son's middle name is a pun for music (that I can't share since this is a throwaway).   


Lately, though, I just look at all my gear, all my skills, the time I've spent on its vanity, and I just find myself filled with disgust and resentment. I hate that I spend time playing music rather than learn a practical skill like wood working or being with my family. I hate that I am so drawn to an instrument, and I hate that I can't bring myself to rid myself of them as many were gifts. I find myself now even hating everything about the concept of melody, harmony, rhythm, the fact its intelligible, the fact it manipulates emotions for better or for worse rather than what the person genuinely feels without modification. I hate that it distracts me, I hate the fact that I can't be free of it when I sleep at night and a melody comes to me against my will. I hate that I can't go to church and worship without hearing music, that even when I try to ""shut off"" and just focus on the Lord. I hate that I can't escape the unheard melodies plaguing me as a lock up my house at night, nor can I walk around listening to a podcast without some made up sound tormenting me. I hate that I can't sit in silence in my car without an old song coming to mind, or a conversation with someone reminding me of a song I once heard and the melody embedding itself into me. I hate that I can't listen to other people's music without wanting to join in or appreciating it as it already is. I hate the idea of monetizing my music to the extent that I live off it, but I also hate the idea of not monetizing something I've spent so much time and effort refining. I hate the feeling of shame of playing instead of doing something else, and I hate the shame of feeling like I wasted my life refining a vain skill.  


I don't feel burnt out; I feel cursed. I love music, I think, but I am becoming overwhelmed with disdain and hatred for it. Honestly, I **never** want to hear another note again in my life again, questioning if I would be happier deaf, but I also shudder at the idea as I doubt I could escape my curse of creativity."

580,Would you perform a paid gig for YOUR repeat client with somebody whose music you like and objectively know is a good artist but haven't jammed with before?,9,musicians,33,"Update: Thank you everybody for your responses. After considering all your perspectives, getting an opinion from a good buddy who has worked with the artist numerous times in the past, and having a follow up convo with him not having time for a jam sesh but explaining his music mentality and methodology, and weighing the risks vs benefits, I have decided to give it a go with the artist I posted about. Mahalo!

I have a VIP client that I do all their expos for as a duo. My bandmate recently quit music so I've been building up an alternate roster. We do live looping, live jamming lounge instrumentals. The gig is to provide low level background music to greet expo attendees at the front door. I've brought on one new bandmate that I've busked with several times, so there's been a certain level of vibe and trust established. There are two days, my new bandmate is taking day 1 with me. I would ideally like to use day 2 for another musician to expand the bandmate roster for future gigs. If not, I'll bring in the new bandmate.

One much more established musician in my network has expressed interest in the gig. I've seen him perform many times, we know each other through these performances as I have worked many events with his talent buyer. However, we don't know each other on a personal level, have never hung out outside a show, or ever played music together. Show is in a couple weeks. I've asked to jam first to see how we vibe and he says he's too busy. I'm only considering him an option because I've seen him perform before several times, like his music and it would be fun to perform with him. I have expressed to him that this is my VIP repeat client and I do not want to deliver a less quality product than what they are used to. He says as long as he knows the keys it'll be fine. I get this, but I think there's a lot more to vibing in a performance duo than just knowing the keys.

I've only ever performed a paid gig with people I've jammed with before. Am I being too anal here? Do you guys have wisdom to share? I'm currently leaning towards a no.

Edit: My instrumentals, while not overly complicated IMO, are originals."

This does not happen a lot but whenever I come across a player that came unprepared the normal thing I do is to ask someone else next time to take there place. 

I used to give these players some slack and hoping they play better next time but almost always they mess up. So now I'm a lot less patient, especially if the gigs I get are paid well. 

These actions have gotten me in a bit of bother. A great guitarist and good friend of mine was this kind of player who didn't practice. I passed the next gig off to another guitarist and he was really upset with me, saying that ""as a band leader, I would have appreciated a lot more direction from you and we would not have had this problem"". 

Btw, all my music has recordings, demos and charts written out. 

I find it really hard to confront people about there playing, that's why I have stuck to my normal method. But now I'm open to more solutions.

601,Once a month rehearsal enough?,15,musicians,45,Me and friends formed a band about a year ago expressly to bring my original indie rock compositions to life. 3 out of the 4 members (including myself) have families and live a fairly busy life. Initially we agreed to meet up once a month to jam and rehearse. But every time we get together we can't seem to nail the 4-5 songs that we've been working on. A couple of the guys think it's because we only meet once a month. They're  saying we need to play more. Unfortunately I really cannot get out of family commitments unless the sessions are scheduled a few months in advance. Is once a month really not enough to learn 4-5 songs? Am I expecting too much?

610,good job for someone in a band?,0,musicians,10,"im basically just seeking job ideas for someone in their early 20‚Äôs thats trying to be in a band for a living. currently, my friend and i work at a regular fast food job just to pay the rent and bills, (and we‚Äôre saving up for studio time) but we really want to find a place to work thats going to be more aligned with our ultimate goal. working fast food 40hrs a week is not good for our mental health, and makes it hard to practice. even on the days we‚Äôre off due to being tired and mentally preparing for the next shift. does anyone have any ideas? we arent classically trained in our instruments, nor have we studied music theory in or out of school. we‚Äôre just two guys who finished high school and immediately started trying to pursue our dreams at any cost. that being said, im just not sure if something like a studio assistant or music teacher would be a good option for us. ive been racking my brain but i cant seem to think of anything that would make sense. the best i can come up with would be to work at a music venue or something like that. any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated. thank you!!"
611,Serious discussion about the future of music and the value of ‚Äúhuman music‚Äù vs ai generated music.,0,musicians,90,"So recently I‚Äôve seen some applications that can create some really incredible simulations of music. I think this is awesome and is (imo) kind of one of the final steps toward true ‚Äúpunk‚Äù expression. A literal music generation technology from the psyche of any person would be the only think I can think of beyond that.

I think it‚Äôs amazing how far the technology has come and has increasingly made ‚Äúnon-musicians‚Äù be able to make music. I know that sounds elitist, but I mean it in the best way possible. I don‚Äôt literally mean I don‚Äôt consider purely production or raw perseverance based musicians musicians, but if we consider the act of musical performance a trade in itself I think it is a fair argument to make that there are musicians and then there are MUSICIANS. Feel me?

Anyway with this being the case now, what is the future like for musicians, and do you believe the trade of music will become irrelevant or more respected?

I personally believe that if literally every person could just start generating music down the line it would definitely topple the recording industry entirely at some point and would take a lot of emphasis off of celebrity as a method of ingesting music and art. However, I do think maybe the perceived value and appeal of those that can learn, perform, or improvise music would go waaaay up. It would kind of recast musicians as what they are meant to be, which is a tradesmen of entertainment. Not a special genius that speaks for a generation or some corny shit, just dudes good at making sounds happen fr.

I also feel like if people can generate recordings themselves, the value of seeing music that is not immediately being performed would be diminished. Not entirely, but I definitely think it would be less sought after.

Also, down the line if people can generate ideas brain to reality in the future, imagine how insane bands could become and what fusions of analog performance with bio-digital could entail?

Idk what do you think?

615,Band Roles: Who gets royalties/pay?,28,musicians,51,"I play bass in a band whose name follows the formula ‚ÄúSinger Songwriter and the Something Band‚Äù

The singer is the band leader and writes all of the songs before bringing them to the band to put together. We each write our own instrument parts for the songs. 

The singer books gigs which we split evenly. The singer also financed the recording of the EP that was just released. 

None of the band members were paid for writing and recording their parts,and also won‚Äôt get any royalties because we didn‚Äôt write the songs, but did write our parts.

I guess my question is, when you are a band member and not just a hired gun, what should you be getting paid for and what should you be getting royalties for? Should I ask for a minimum for every gig regardless of how much we get paid total? Should I ask to be paid for rehearsal time where I write my part to his song? Should I be paid for studio time where I record the part to his song?
(I realize at the level we are at, the financial aspect of royalties are far less important than the principle) 

EDIT: Thanks for all the thoughtful responses 

For Background‚Ä¶ Singer wrote and recorded an album with session musicians, then decided to put a band together so he could play it live. All of the songs he‚Äôs written since the first album have been written by him alone then arranged by the band in rehearsal. When he said he wanted to record the EP with those new songs, he took care of everything. But the line is kind of blurred between band member and hired Gun because Singer paid for the studio, mastering, etc, but the idea of paying the band for studio time never came up and I‚Äôm wondering if it should have, if we have no true stake in the band. Or should we have a small percentage or the royalties for being the band that recorded all of the songs and had input on putting them all together in rehearsals? "

623,It‚Äôs hard to focus on my major,2,musicians,7,"*cross-posted, sorry if this isn‚Äôt the right place for this!

Hi all, I wanted to ask some things, and I don‚Äôt really have anyone in my life that can answer them right now? I‚Äôm a music major (22f), so far have talked to a therapist who said I most likely have moderate ADHD, and I‚Äôm struggling SO MUCH to practice. I‚Äôve tried to look up other stories online to see if anyone else has the same experience as me, but it seems like the majority of people are able to really easily focus on music because it‚Äôs something they‚Äôre really passionate about? I‚Äôm struggling to have a routine, actually put in work for my degree, etc, and it constantly makes me feel like maybe I shouldn‚Äôt be in this major because I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot as passionate.‚Äù

Once I start, I love practicing, but I like playing with other people in the large performing ensembles more. I‚Äôve always really, really enjoyed it, and ever since elementary/middle school when I picked up an instrument, I haven‚Äôt had any rhyme or reason with practicing (which at this point, isn‚Äôt helping me at all, it‚Äôs SO HARD to learn what I need to learn, and I feel like I‚Äôm sabotaging myself). I feel like I used to totally hyperfocus more on music too when I practiced, but as I got older, I shifted focus more away from music. I love it, so much, but I feel like something is wrong for me for not actively hyperfocusing on music like I think would be nicer at this point. One thing I DO hyperfocus on is crochet, I got back into it a couple of years ago and have done a ton with it. But, I wish I could just apply that passion to music, something that I know I love, everyone around me tells me I love, but I can‚Äôt seem to actually show that love, I guess. 

Would anyone have any tips or tricks? Planners really haven‚Äôt worked for me in the past, and I‚Äôve had a terrible track record with trying to establish new habits. I just want to feel like the main portion of my degree isn‚Äôt such a struggle, maybe know how to motivate myself, and feel like I deserve to be there in the first place. I‚Äôve had a ton of imposter syndrome over the past few years, and I wish I didn‚Äôt treat practicing like every other procrastinating assignment. 

Thanks no matter what :)"

And what do you wish you knew about before you began gigging? As in, what you would go back and tell yourself from the past with the knowledge you have now.

Would really appreciate any and all replies. Thanks! :)

[If it matters, my plan is to perform live as a solo artist (primarily focusing on original material) but with a fuller sound than just 1 instrument; I‚Äôll create fully instrumented tracks, remove the parts I can play live, then play along to what then functions as a backing track. It‚Äôs unideal - obviously I wish I could convey the full experience 100% live - but alas, I only have 4 limbs and 1 mouth, and am lacking the finances to constantly hire people to play my stuff.]"
627,Gig Pricing ,15,musicians,17,"So me and a couple buddies from music school got together and made a band. We are in a small town with no local band so word traveled fast. We keep getting offers to do gigs at local bars and event centers. We have a full band (sax/trumpet/trombone) plus guitar,bass, piano, drums and a singer +backup. Our group was thinking of doing a compressed 4 person band at each gig rather than hauling 9 people stuff through a bar. How much do you think we should charge? We are college trained musicians but still playing for the community we a apart of, so we would like it to stay fair (money wise)on both sides.

I started way from the bottom and I‚Äôve been band leader for about 3-4 years now. It‚Äôs bitter sweet bc tonight I played with the musicians I started out with and felt great to give it one last go together.

It‚Äôs beautiful to look back on all this years that have passed and seeing how much I‚Äôve taught to others even without trying. 

I hope I find another band where I‚Äôm going and hopefully I‚Äôll appreciate them as much as I‚Äôve done with the bands I‚Äôve played with at my church.

Without visual media (i.e. tiktok, screens making concerts more interesting, websites etc), do you think music would have such a prevalence today?  

How have music videos and live visuals changed the way we experience popular music compared to, say, listening to the radio? 
 
Do you think visuals can make a song more popular, even if the music itself isn't that strong? 
 
Has the rise of streaming platforms like YouTube changed the expectations for how music should be presented? 
 
Do you think there may be a risk of visuals overshadowing the music entirely in the future?

We have done shorter tours before, previously in a camper van w/ converted beds + trailer and had a lot of space left in the trailer.

&#x200B;

We've traveled in a Sienna before for a weekend show and had a lot of space, but also we didn't bring the drum kit.

Do you think a smaller vehicle, like a Toyota Sienna or a Honda Odyssey would work? Or should I look more at a Ford Transit or Sprinter van?

I don't mind being a little cramped (plus, the sienna is like $2k for the month, vs a sprinter is more like $5k and worse on gas), but what worries me is that we start loading everything up and realize that we can't fit all our gear & luggage in!

659,Going into a studio as a newbie‚Ä¶would love some feedback ,6,musicians,21,"So I‚Äôm a songwriter and acoustic guitarist, not much of a singer, and I mostly write for others to sing. I‚Äôm looking at getting in a studio down the road with one of my songs that is gaining traction, and maybe reworking it a little while in the studio to get it where I want it to be. I have zero experience with recording studios and even less with mixing, mastering and engineering, and I really don‚Äôt know how all that works. I have a musician friend who does not live in the same area as me but he has a home studio and he has been  recording the instrumental tracks. He sends them to me, and so far I‚Äôve been recording in my city with my singer friends using my little audio interface and DAW, which isn‚Äôt much and I don‚Äôt know but the basics on the DAW. But it has been okay for my purposes up until now. I also have a producer friend, also in a different city, who wants to come to town for about ten days and go in a studio with several different singers and possibly a band, although we could also use my musician friends tracks so I guess in that case would only need the singers in the studio. My musician friend is not able to travel and so unfortunately can‚Äôt be in the studio with us. So I guess we‚Äôll either be using his tracks or starting from scratch‚Ä¶I guess neither is ideal as he is familiar with the song already, so if we pulled in other musicians there would be more of a learning curve.  Anyway I‚Äôll be leaning on my producer friend to help with all of this, but I thought I‚Äôd put this out there to see what others experiences and advice might be on something like this, as I am very much a newbie. Thank you.

661,"19 y/o singer songwriter, wants to play ambience gigs at restaurants",0,musicians,5,"I'm a 19 year old bedroom musician and I just want so badly to be able to play gigs at restaurants for some cash every night. I have solid enough guitar and piano skills to play full sets of songs from memory and I can sing fairly well. Granted, I don't have the greatest voice, but I've seen plenty of guys as ok as I am do what I want to do. I play mostly folk/jazz/indie pop songs and some jazz standards. But in my area/city, the main style of live music places usually show is country, and I don't really play country. I'm also a non-white teenage girl; I don't really look like the typical older white country musicians who usually perform.

I've gone to open mics and I've performed in school shows, and I'm currently about to join my college's music theater department. I've wanted for a few years and I've tried to reach out to restaurants to play some gigs. I have my own amp, an electric and acoustic guitar, a mic, and a speaker for it. The problem is I don't really have any kind of professional profile. A video or two up on TikTok, but usually I send out video/mp3 files to whoever I want to convince. I'm polite and professional in conversation, but I have no website and no professional gigging experience to back me up.

Mostly I've just cold-called restaurants who I know have live music to ask if they're looking for musicians, but usually they either aren't looking, don't get back, or they hear me out but end up being unable to give me a gig. I've also contacted a local agent but they didn't get back to me after I sent them my info. I think they usually give half-hearted excuses, maybe because I'm not very good, but I genuinely think any semi-decent musician who just knows how to play enough likable songs would be able to do what I want to do. I think my problem is I just don't know how to establish a professional platform for myself. I don't know how this kind of gig industry works. I'm making this post for professional rather than skill advice. How do I get people to respond to me? What's the right method for reaching out to places for live music? Should I get an agent? How do I get an agent to hear me out? I know I should probably make a website, but what do I have to show for if I have no professional experience? Also, what's the right gear for solo gigs? Is what I have enough?

I don't want to be famous, I don't really even want to release my own music or be an artist, I just want to play local gigs and I don't know how. I don't have connections or music industry friends/family. But this is kind of my secret life dream. If I could just start playing at restaurants or coffee shops or anything, that would be enough for me. Advice would be really appreciated. Thanks."

I will try to explain my best while keeping it short. I have a Elektron Syntakt, a Roland SH-4D and a Akai MPC live. I also have a Arturia Keystep Pro and a Native Intruments Komplete Kontrol S61 Mk2. 

My idea is to have everything connected, through Ableton via MIDI, at any point for ease of use plus a microphone and a guitar. I was thinking about getting the Arturia Audiofuse Studio which would cover pretty much everything (inputs so I can have everything connected, 2 headphones out and MIDI connection plus the usb ports). In this way I can have everything connected to the same spot without having to fiddle with cables. However, the more I read the more I get scared of making a wrong buy mainly due to the audiofuse being usb 2.0 and the preamps not being good enough or have some noise. 

Therefore I have another option which would have to be a more long term accomplishment. I have been hearing great about the SSL 12 but it would be some what a compromise for me. The 4 extra inputs would be handy as well as the usb ports included in the Arturia. If I got the SSL 12, later on I would have to get an expansion(through ADAT possible) and maybe a good expansion to get the 8 inputs I would like to have would be the SSL PURE DRIVE QUAD (or maybe the OCTO)

It‚Äôs so much information that I am getting very confused so I am asking for the help of this wonderful community to bring me some clarity. Any more info that might be helpful please ask. Thank you in advance üôè"

680,Have you ever been in a situation where you hide progress?,14,musicians,21,"I'm in the scenario of being surrounded by ultra-realistic people who stopped living in the beauty of things, and play capitalism.  I play it too, but I don't let it affect me.  I am never the person that lashes out and puts my anxiety/frustration on others almost ever.

I've gotten to a point where now things are getting serious, I'm preparing for different scenarios, getting ready to treat this as a job.  

But people around me don't really show support.  In fact, I'm usually the emotional support and pusher, I'll get people art supplies, offer to buy drums, woodworking equipment, the whole spectrum.  People like my songs I'll send them, they'll like my live playing, but I don't think they understand where I want to go.  And it's not because I haven't communicated it, it's because it's not a realistic goal to some people.  They don't see a vision/goal because it seems cartoon-ish to them.  But I am just keyed into the world differently than them, BUT I respect their perspective and their realistic views.

But I'm hiding a lot of my progress from the past year, I'm like treating it like I'm doing heroin sometimes, just trying to get a hit and hide away sometimes.  I'm in a situation of JUST getting a new job after a few months, so I've had to hide a lot of things because of course ""why are you playing music when you should be looking for a job.""  All fair, makes sense.  But it's interesting to be stuck in a scenario of progress where you know you can only rely on yourself, and you need to hide your actual goals, because people will pounce on you if you were truly honest.  Again, I believe it's fair to criticize it, but on the other hand, it also sucks a tad to be surrounded by little positive influence. "

We have 3 amps and we will have power, so I am thinking one amp for vocals, one for the keyboard, and one for the guitar+bass. Obviously this is not ideal but I think it should be better than nothing. Alternatively we could rent a PA system but I'm not super keen on spending the money to do that for this one gig.

Overnight, he went from having 3K followers to a staggering 200K on Instagram and half a million on TikTok, with his Spotify garnering 10 million listeners and reaching the number 1 spot on global charts. 

I am genuinely pleased to see my friend experience this success because his songs are great. I am just frustrated and feeling hopeless because this success seemed entirely random; his song went viral without much effort or consistency on his part - he made the song, hasn't really been posting much TikToks and doesn't know much about marketing; just posted a TikTok (nothing special) and it popped off. While you may suggest it's an attestation that his success means others can do it too.. it's disheartening seeing other artists including this friend who have some other OUTSTANDING songs, market them so much, put so much effort into writing/production/marketing... and nothing happens. 

It feels like success in the music industry boils down to luck so much.... leaving us feeling demotivated and overlooked despite our efforts.

I feel that this one is similar to black sabbath, classic heavy metal. Great in every aspect, Layne was a killer apart from the bass on this one.

Where it is common for the bassists to follow the guitars, on this song, Mike follows the drum for most of the part, even the bass fills complement the drum fills. It has a damn perfect rhythm. Mike is one of the biggest inspirations and one of my favourite bassists. He has a multilayered style of playing and is a multidimensional bassists with so nany weapons in his arsenal, can play with a finger, a pick, can slap and his usage of chords and slides are godly.

Not much of a challenge for an AIC song, just memorizing the changing bass fills maybe. Figured out the tabs by isolating the bass from the mix.

Genre - Grunge / Heavy Metal 
Original Bassist - Mike Starr

713,Guitar resale etiquette,27,musicians,164,"1. Depreciation: Your guitar‚Äôs value drops by about 1/3 the moment that you purchase it and leave the store with it. You can post that SG Standard for $1200 and refuse to budge, but nobody is going to buy it from you. They‚Äôll just buy a brand new one.
2. Obscurity vs rarity: You have a model that was only manufactured for one year? Cool. That‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt make it rare and valuable. My 2014 SGJ is definitely obscure and hard to find. It‚Äôs still only worth about $650. I audibly laugh when I see people post them for $900 knowing that they‚Äôre not very good guitars and were available for only $500 brand new. Same goes for Airline, Kay, Harmony and either dirt cheap vintage guitars people think are worth $1,000 just because they‚Äôre old.
3. Aftermarket parts: I don‚Äôt care if you spent $6 million on parts. They‚Äôre useless in the guitar value wise. If you want money for them, take them out and sell them separately. Regardless of what you paid, nobody is going to pay you near retail value for the aftermarket parts in your guitar ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôve ruined a high end USA made guitar with unnecessary ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù.
4. Vintage: Your vintage gear is only valuable if it‚Äôs all original. If you‚Äôve painted it, changed  parts, etc it is now just a regular guitar with no special value.
5. Selling an expensive guitar with no case is like selling grenades with the pins removed.
6. Headstock repairs: Headstock repairs cut the instrument‚Äôs price in half. Your Les Paul was worth $2,000 brand new. The second you left the store with it, it was worth $1,400. The second you broke the headstock, the value dropped to $700. I don‚Äôt care if Jesus Christ himself did the headstock repair. It‚Äôs a $700 guitar.

As a general rule when selling ANYTHING, it‚Äôs almost definitely worth 20%-25% less than what you think it‚Äôs worth.

Do you like music or play guitar? If so, we (University College London researchers) would love to hear from you![https://redcap.slms.ucl.ac.uk/surveys/?s=KET9EWYWJRCCXPNN](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/redirect/away?url=https%3A%2F%2Fredcap.slms.ucl.ac.uk%2Fsurveys%2F%3Fs%3DKET9EWYWJRCCXPNN)¬†

An automatic full band score to guitar fingerstyle score converter for private practice has been written as part of a final year computer science undergraduate project and we‚Äôd love to get your anonymous feedback on the quality of the music generated.¬†¬†We therefore invite you to take an anonymous online questionnaire.

The questionnaire has between 11 and 34 multiple choice questions (depending on your answers). We estimate it will take 5-10 minutes to complete for non-guitarists, and between¬†¬†5 and 30 minutes for guitarists (we will ask you to try playing some music).¬†¬†You can stop at any point.

¬†For more information, please see the information sheet here:¬†[T105 PIL.pdf](https://liveuclac-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/ucacngo_ucl_ac_uk/ERq9zrwNZvlPi2vwAj3nOOQBIyesTplXm4clXNIDSfhKhg?e=odGs9P)

I‚Äôm from Auckland, New Zealand and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be many willing free musos to sink some time into a new project to see if it will work. 
Anywho, I‚Äôve had an idea within my original idea to entice professional musicians but first I need to take the music which is electronic and convert it into live musical parts but I‚Äôm just a drummer and I don‚Äôt have the ability to be able to do that. 
So what I‚Äôm asking is, is there some app or someone that I could talk to about converting non live music to live organic instruments to be played live? I can hear a lot of these parts in my head but I can‚Äôt extract that into something that people could read or listen to learn so it‚Äôs kind of frustrating from all angles.

727,How to cultivate loyal fans:,0,musicians,7,"In today's digital music age, building a loyal fanbase is crucial for sustained success.
The primary purpose of an entertainer is to entertain their audience. If they don‚Äôt have a loyal fan base to entertain, the artist either isn‚Äôt entertaining or just hasn‚Äôt found the people who will enjoy them.

As a professional songwriter with over a decade of experience helping fellow artists navigate their careers, I‚Äôve witnessed firsthand the evolving landscape of the music industry. In this era dominated by social media and streaming platforms, success is now more about capturing and retaining audience attention, fostering genuine connections, and building a loyal fanbase.

Here are some key strategies to foster fan loyalty:

- Know Your Audience:
Invest time in understanding your fans' brand preferences, habits, motivations, values, etc Utilize analytics tools and direct feedback to gain insights into what resonates with them and tailor your approach accordingly. You should have a concrete idea of who your average fan is and what their specific interests are.

- Know Your Value: 
People engaged with content or listen to music to be entertained and validated. Know what entertains them and do it consistently to build loyalty. Being a successful artist is a happy balance between self expression and giving fans with what they want.

- Collaborate Wisely: 
Partner with influencers or fellow artists who share your audience to broaden your reach and credibility. Collaborative projects and cross-promotions can introduce your music to new fans while strengthening your connection with existing ones.

Stop looking for step-by-step guides, hacks, and quick results. Building fan loyalty is a gradual process that requires patience, content that entertains those people specially, and consist follow through. No matter what. Get curious about your ideal fans and what make them tick. Then entertain them!

Feel free to comment with follow up questions. Good luck!"

729,Introduction ,2,musicians,2,"Hello everyone! I just wanted to introduce myself. My name is James, and I am a blues pianist. I am self taught and have been playing piano for 17 years. I never had a lesson, I was just inspired and wanted to be a pianist more than anything. 

Around 18 I started to love the Blues genre. My best friend introduced me to Stevie Ray Vaughan and i was hooked. So anyway, I got accepted to my music program in my university, and I just wanted to show you this little improvisation I did in their band room. I am very informal when it comes to reading music and music theory, so taking this plunge into proper music is a bit intimidating. 

I was hoping you guys could tell me what you think of my style.

I'm playing Keys 2, and in the KeyboardTEK program there is a patch cue at m. 142 for a horn glissando and a bari sax glissando, which is also notated in the score. The problem is I don't know when it should be played; there is a half rest but if I play it as written rhythmically it bleeds into the next bar, which is pizz. strings, glockenspiel, etc.. How would you play this, or if you've played the show before, how did you play it? I've attached the score section below.

739,Video recording of live band performance?,1,musicians,0,"Hello!

I want to record my band's live shows for promo on social media. We're a trio: singer, guitar, and sax. We've had some decent videos just taken from a smart phone, but I'd like to step it up a bit. Thinking to mount an i-phone on a stand and record the whole show. Have some questions:

Is it worthwhile to buy a better microphone to record the sound?

Can I get one that will connect to the i-phone so the i-phone will use it instead of it's built-in mic?

I want to avoid recording the audio and video separate and having to sync them up in a different program. Would like a simple set up, set it and forget it, maybe ask my girlfriend to babysit it during the show.

Thanks!"

I am a rhythm guitarist for the group, while my band member is the lead guitarist as well as the lead singer.  He's very difficult to work with.  He won't listen to my ideas, as well as the others.  He comes up with the setlists himself and doesn't ask for our input.  And above all else, he is very condescending whenever we provide an audio clip of us playing or practicing in person.  Always says things like ""oh, that's good bud.  A little slower than the original but not bad.""  I also asked if I could play a few piano songs on my keyboard, showed him a song.  The band loved it, and thought it was a great idea.  He shut it down because ""nobody cares about piano"".  Should I just leave the band if I'm not enjoying it?"

Here's the first single from my upcoming LP Microcosms. Alien Transmissions is available for download \[free\] from my Bandcamp page, and as each track from the LP is released, I'll be uploading an accompanying music video I've created personally to match the track. As this record was generously funded by Arts Council England, I'll be giving away digital copies of the album for free; be sure to subscribe to my Bandcamp to recieve notifications when tracks from Microcosms are published.

Microcosms came about through a realisation I'd been living until the age of 27 with far-sightedness. In re-examing the visual world around me with a new clarity, I decided to apply the same investigation to sound; this record is a collection of electro-magnetic radio transmissions, noise and field recordings all treated through my modular synthesiser.

Please show me some love or leave a comment if you dig it. Have a nice day.

And it hasn‚Äôt gone well at all. I thought I‚Äôd find a lot of cool like-minded people that would be willing to show me stuff. If anything what I‚Äôve experienced is the opposite. Everyone I‚Äôve jammed with seems to get off on critiquing my playing. Instead of offering tips, or knowledge. They just rip on my playing. Like I get it. I gotta lot of stuff to work on. But that‚Äôs why I want to jam with ppl. But a lot of these people act like I have to be a professional musician just to get my foot in the door. And they guard their knowledge like it‚Äôs the secret to the universe lol. I thought it was all about sharing passion and love for music? I just want to make music but it feels like meeting ppl to form a band or jam with is impossible. And if it‚Äôs something that I really am serious about.

746,What instrument(s) do you play and for how long have you played?,2,musicians,11,
747,I cannot decide on my next instrument,0,musicians,11,"So i play alot of instruments...drums, percussion, piano, bagpipes, bass, guitar, ukelele, snare, anything i can hit

I have played instruments ever since i was little, and i am honestly sure playing instruments is my hyperfixiation.

So naturally i want to play more,  however i just cannot decide between Trumpet and Tenor Sax as my next adventure.

I want to play both for the same reason, jazz i have had an interest in saxophone ever since i was a little kid thanks to one of my classmates, but my parents never allowed me because they hate the saxophone with a passion, now i'm 23 and no longer care about what they think of my choice of instruments (as you can see from the bagpipes)

But trumpet also greatly interests me thanks to things like jazz, Chet baker, Lucky Chops.

Trumpet would be the cheaper option as we have a trumpet at home because my father played trumpet when he was in the airforce and it still works fine.

So yeah TLDR i can't decide on my next instrument : D"

749,Should I get a ukulele or a kalimba?,3,musicians,11,"Recently I‚Äôve been trying to decide whether to get a ukulele or a kalimba and was wondering if anyone on here can help me with the decision. 

I‚Äôm still a decently new musician and I‚Äôm in a band with a few friends, I mostly play guitar and sing and was hoping to add to my roster of instruments.

The reasons for wanting a ukulele is for more portable play and a different sound and also because of Israel ‚ÄúIZ‚Äù Kamakawiwo‚Äôole and my love for his music.

The reasons for wanting a kalimba is for the melodic sound, because it‚Äôs something different and because of my favourite track/song by Jarrad Wright ‚Äúflying dream‚Äù (if you haven‚Äôt listened to him before I would highly recommend).

So what do you think I should get and why?"

I've had my electric drum set for a few years, and I took it seriously for about 6 months, watching lessons and reading stuff out of a book, and have only been doing freestyle stuff for the most part now. I also do not play to worship music (contemporary christian), mainly just doing rock or a little bit of jazz stuff. Any tips on how to approach this? I'm just worried because my playing has just been playing along and having fun, so I don't even know if it is good, and also I have never played for or with anyone."

766,Should I pay the band members?,0,musicians,64,"Bandleader here. We're a pretty active band in our area and play lots of local and regional shows. Originals only - not a cover band. Genre is indie/shoegaze. I invest lots of my personal funds and time into the band: recording, physical record/CD production, marketing, buying merch, etc. The other band members do not put money into the band, and I don't ask them to. People like our band, and we have good attendance at shows. We also make money from tickets/cover charges and merch, but not a ton. I keep detailed accounting and we're perpetually in the red. My understanding is that this is the normal state of financial affairs for bands like ours.

My question is whether I should be paying the other band members with what we make at shows. They've told me they just love being in the band and are doing it for fun, but I know similar bands in our area DO pay members after shows. What's the etiquette here? Should I be paying the guys?

I'm not trying to be a Scrooge. And honestly, there's no money to Scrooge over. From a financial standpoint, the band is literally just a big debt I carry. There are no profits. All the money we've earned has gone back into the band. Should I pay the members nonetheless? I just want to do the right thing here.

EDIT: Thanks for the responses! I've decided to start splitting compensation for shows among the performing band members."

I first started using ditto and it was ok, but now that i learn more and more about business side of music i am getting more and more disappointed. I feel like i got no tools on ditto and their publishing service does absolutely nothing.

So. Here is the question.

I‚Äôm newer to recording music and have found a ton of catharsis and enjoyment in recording and producing my own music, as well as collaborations (via file sharing). I‚Äôm in a group with 3 men and none of them seem to mind playing out and they even enjoy it. I have extreme social anxiety, and I am a working wife and mom of 2 young kids and while we don‚Äôt play out often, it‚Äôs such a drag for me to cut my work schedule, find a sitter, lugging gear around, be out late, etc‚Ä¶on top of hating performing and only being comfortable in my studio alone with my laptop. I‚Äôm about to throw in the towel and tell them I don‚Äôt want to do any more live shows (we‚Äôve only done 3 and have a 4th coming up next week). But I don‚Äôt want to be a party crasher and basically kill our live presence since I‚Äôm a bit of the main feature in our band by contributing vocals and multiple instruments and providing the structure of our set.

Our last release was in 2018 and MUCH has changed, so I'm trying to absorb as many FREE helpful resources as possible. So far, I've listened to:

* Podcasts **(Music Bi Weekly, Music Marketing Manifesto**, and **Music Industry Blueprint**)
* Read **Two Story Melody** blog posts
* Plan to watch **Jesse Cannon** and **Two Story Media's YouTube videos**

Are there any other FREE resources you would recommend that you've found most helpful when planning a release? Our goals are to increase Spotify plays and listeners, Facebook page reach, Instagram followers and engagement, and TikTok followers and views.

We're preparing to release a single a month for a while instead of an album all at once to regain online engagement.

775,I feel like it will never be good enough ,114,musicians,113,"After studying music for many years and graduating my music bachelor, I find myself wishing I‚Äôd done something else. 

I see my peers go viral, get playlisted, get radio play and playing gigs every week. I constantly stalk their numbers and see how mine are barely existent.

I truly believe my art and music is good enough, but I lack the willpower and nerve to put myself out there enough. I have tried my best to network but due to not being a conventionally attractive girl in the industry I struggle immensely to connect on a authentic level as they are superficial. 

This is no excuse but I am very alone in the world as I only have my brother and friends (my family isn‚Äôt in my life). I have never had a stable place to call home and I long for a peace and love I lack right now feeling like a failure next to my amazing peers. I don‚Äôt know if I should keep going or accept that I don‚Äôt want to give more of myself as it‚Äôs making me unhappy as of now.

EDIT:
Thank you for all the lovely replies. This morning I started missing the fun of writing songs and remembered why I even started doing music to begin with. All the different opinions and stories you have commented reminded me that being born with a creative drive is something beautiful, and regardless the outcome it‚Äôs a talent we should celebrate wether it‚Äôs alone in the rehearsal room or in front of a big crowd. I finally sat down and made a new playlist (it‚Äôs been 1 year since my last) and suddently I feel a little more alive again. I had forgotten how amazing it feels to discover new music‚Ä¶

In two weeks I have my final exam concert, a 40 min set with all my original work. I worked so hard and made a team of my band, strings, sax, dancers and a choir. I‚Äôll cherish the performance and be proud of doing what I always longed for.ü•π"
776,Advice for growing fanbase,1,musicians,27,"I'm a young prog musician (only 17), and have been posting onto social media fairly regularly for the past year, or so: I had to change accounts at one point, due to an invasion of privacy, and on the music account have only amassed 87 followers, most of whom are all people I know.

I consistently see people my age or younger, often less skilled (not to seem arrogant) with far more reach and attention, and was wondering how I can further engage other musicians future fans.

I don't have a means by which to record music at home, with no audio interface, DAW, etc, but I write consistently, post (sometimes infrequently), and yet seem to have little to no growth. Recently I saw a huge influx of non-followers reached, yet few engaged with my content.

I have usually played with a band, sometimes fronting, sometimes as just the bassist, but never a solo show. 

I was told it was on a Saturday, from 12-4. I gave her (my colleague who first asked me, ""What do you charge?)"" samples of my singing and playing bass.

She seemed interested but I didn't have any recordings of me doing covers, just my originals.

I figure I would mostly be singing and playing funk/r&b guitar. I do have a loop pedal that might expand my sound, though I am still new to using it.

Anyway, wondering what is reasonable to charge if it's just me? I don't know yet how long I would be expected to play, but I imagine it's at least two sets."

779,Thinking of playing instruments again but afraid I can't do it.,2,musicians,8,"So I have already played multiple instruments when growing up. I first played the piano until elementary school. Then I switched to orchestra and private lessons in middle school and beginning of highschool . Then I started playing guitar mid-highschool till the beginning of last year when I decided to stop cause I couldn't juggle both classes at the lessons. 

I am kinda having a crisis and I would like to refund myself and start enjoying doing stuff again instead of just consuming content, and I miss just playing music. 

However I just feel tired and just do other stuff that is menial and low effort. I feel like I can't find the energy to do anything meaningful (which is another issue by itself but related to my want to play again.)

I am also considering what I should play. I don't have a piano or keyboard anymore, my violin was a rental. I just have the guitar now. Idk if I should play a new instrument or just do one that I have played before.

So I guess I have a few questions. How do you keep yourself motivated to play an instrument? And how did you choose what instrument you wanted to play? "
780,"Advice for playing guitar live, stage fright sufferer ",5,musicians,27,"So I‚Äôm a drummer with a decent few years live experience.

However my second instrument is guitar. I‚Äôm pretty mediocre at it.

Soon I might want to play my songs live on guitar. Would be a band context so not just me.

Thing is I used to get quite nervous before gigs.

And the idea of guitar live terrifies me. Mild shaking before a gig? Not a big deal with drums. But guitar? Another story. Some of my songs are mostly strumming others are arpeggiated kind of riffs Johnny Marr style. 

These are so easy to mess up if shaking or overthinking or having self defeating negative thoughts. I have many of these because I am an OCD and anxiety sufferer. But it‚Äôs my dream for my music to reach an audience and play live.

Any advice specific to playing guitar live as a stage fright sufferer, would be so appreciated."

I have a question: I have been using the music distributor ""LevelMusic"" for months and everything has worked without any problems in the past. Since the beginning of the year, however, there have been problems with the payout. This also applies to many other artists, as there have been a lot of bad reviews on Truspilot since the beginning of 2024. This is due to the fact that support only writes back after months or does not pay out the funds. I have now been in contact with ""Spotify for Artist"" and they have suggested that we switch to another distributor. But now my question is: If I transfer my songs over to another distributor, will my royalties still be counted? Currently, only a small part from December and January is counted. Only the US streams and not the streams from the Netherlands (or EU). Could you help me with this question?

I was thinking it be free for bands to enter and give about 15-20 minutes between bands to set up/soundcheck etc. is that enough time?

I‚Äôll be having a group of local art vendors participate in the event and help contribute to prize baskets for the bands. What else should be included in prizes?

I was thinking of doing $7 pre-order tickets and $10 door tickets and paying the venue 10% of proceeds. Should there be an adjustment to the percentage?

814,Rant about local promoter rivalry,6,musicians,9,"I'm in a small city with lots of pubs but only one dedicated live music venue. 

There's one local promoter who puts on free shows (with several acts on the bill) every week at a bar, plus he does a few 'weekenders' during the year, with lots of bands/duos/soloists performing across a couple of days. I would say it's like a hobby/obsession for him that he doesn't seek to profit from.

Lots of musicians like him and appreciate his contribution to keeping the local scene alive. However, Recently I've started to feel pissed off that he holds such a monopoly over local music, to the extent that it's very hard to get a paid gig - because why would people pay when there's free live music every week? 

I saw him ranting on social media about our city's one dedicated live venue where bands play ticketed shows, like he resents the fact that musicians want to get paid - and I am keen to distance myself from this. I believe he thinks we're friends and - although I am grateful for the musical opportunities - he has overshared stuff with me before that I wasn't comfortable with.

In the past I have turned down a slot on another local promoter's radio show because it's someone he has a rivalry with and I wanted to stay on the free promoter's good side. Now I'm returning to local live performance and I want to make it clear that I am a professional and not interested in this guys petty personal beefs if it disadvantages my exposure. 

Do you think this ""big fish, small pond"" mentality is a common thing with local music promoters? How do I stay neutral without seeming aloof?"

The person who played before me was a crowd favorite, so that amped up the pressure. But no problem‚Äîmy stuff is good too. I‚Äôll get up there and prove myself. I‚Äôll amaze this girl with the beauty of my music.

So I get up there‚Ä¶and crumble.

I couldn‚Äôt get accustomed to the mic. My pitch sounded bad‚Äîvery, very bad. I had some false starts. I kept forgetting chords and lyrics. The best parts of these songs flopped badly.

Would much rather hear a cool band, mix a cool record or rock a cool guitar riff than film some talking head/CEO or do audio for a sports game. I actually had a punk radio show on AMP and made some money for a while doing that, II have lived it, breathed it and I have an in-depth knowledge. Would love to be a performer on stage. I like singing, playing guitar, bass, I love to rock. But how realistic is that?? It seems that the sound engineers, recording, mastering engineers and such make much better pay than musicians. I mean, how many top bands are there? Most local bands don't make any money (when I did it in my 20's we played for free or open mic nights) Of course, I'm a LOT better now because I'm taking proper music classes, but still, I heard the chances of making a living playing music playing on big states/concerts are like less than 1% or something like that?

I mean, it's kind of discouraging because all my friends keep telling me I'm wasting my time on this degree and everything, that there's no money in music."

**Joytrip just put out their newest single - ""Let me lay.""**

[**https://open.spotify.com/track/6T8mQYQhaqYs6fw4iq8COT?si=3aa5a7eb96174a35**](https://open.spotify.com/track/6T8mQYQhaqYs6fw4iq8COT?si=3aa5a7eb96174a35)

The song is sonically peacefully whole, while simultaneously driving and energizing. From the get, clean guitar lines oscillate and work together until the snare comes pushing the rhythm ahead into a chorus that reflects times changing and a potentially bleak or optimistic future. This newest single from Joytrip is one that rewards repeat listens and pairs wonderfully with brisk walks by water, driving 4+ hours in the Midwest and horizontal contemplation.

Listen and share! Joytrip had shows in the Midwest leading up to a run of shows in Colorado (Denver, Ft. Collins, Golden, Evergreen).

I‚Äôm a solo folk/singer-songwriter artist, and I‚Äôm curious if anyone has any tips on how artists like this can have stage presence so there‚Äôs no dead air between songs and to seem like you‚Äôre excited and enthused to be there (which I notice a lot of live acts seem the opposite when they play live).

I understand how rock musicians or rappers or more pop artists can have stage presence because their genres kind of foster and allow for gestures or spoken word to get audiences excited. For example, ‚ÄúMake some noise!‚Äù But I feel like that wouldn‚Äôt work in a folk artist‚Äôs situation.

I have a 30-minute set that I want to start playing over the summer, and I need advice. If you‚Äôre curious, some of my inspirations right now are Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Alex G, Phoebe Bridgers, with some country and bluegrass influences.

Also, I‚Äôm pretty new to posting on Reddit, so any advice on etiquette is helpful as well!

I'm getting back out there with some covers (vocal's) and variations of stuff as well as playing my horns. I doubt there is a complete answer to my needs, but here they are:  


1. Lead / chord sheet organization, key changes, etc. I have downloaded OnSong but I just don't get the hype. I'm not subbing to other sources and paying for chord sheets. I can do the chords in a few minutes just listening to the songs. But I do want to be able to use the iPad and change the keys.
2. Score, Piano music. I would also like the above functionality for piano music. If possible.
3. Original and produced backing tracks. I want to use said iPad for backing tracks for when I play sax and sing some contemporary covers. I prefer an organized app, not a playlist someplace on spotify or apple music.
4. Ultimately, I'd also like VIDEO and LYRIC presentation from the same device simultaneously for sing along and karaoke options.   


ok... so, who has the magic answer? 

I'd love any suggestions. It's been a while and the last gig I played was all paper. "

Unbelievable musicianship and just a solid chemistry overall. Like I was just going for a walk one day some guitar guy I met once at a party just happened to be smoking a cig outside his apartment. Flagged me down and asked me ""you play drums right?"" We get to jamming and he said if i wasnt doing anything next saturday his band needed a drummer. 
Me him and the rest of the band(lead singer that, at the time, was on cruches and a whimsical bass player) practiced probably a couple hours in total and we got 3 hours of material down before the gig. It was an all day thing, it was a restaurant that had good outdoor seating just in time for COVID. One of my favorite times I've ever performed.
My question comes from the events follow after this kick ass gig.
We had about 5 or 6 performances after this but we kinda fizzled out and everyone started doing their own thing musically. I'm still great friends with all of them, just don't have the time to jam together like we used to. 
What's your guy's opinions' on getting the band back together? Are you one to revisit old projects or start something new from a fresh perspective?

863,Learn to Produce or Find One?,4,musicians,17,"Hi, I‚Äôm posting here to get some advice on what I should do. I‚Äôm a girl that has always had songs come into my head, melodies, lyrics. I have numerous of songs written in my notes, notebooks, since I was a kid. I hadn‚Äôt thought to do something about this till someone who likes to create music of his own said that they can see me being successful if I make music. Other people have said thit to me too, but I just don‚Äôt even know how to produce. I have the basic equipment for music production, but I just don‚Äôt even know where to start. I know how to play the piano, I know how to read music. I know how I want my music to sound like but having to go through all these different sounds (on Ableton) is just intimidating/overwhelming. And I feel like I can‚Äôt find what I want. One thing is to create a melody but I don‚Äôt know how to do drums which you all know is very essential to making a hit. 

I think I‚Äôd rather find a producer, but how would I go about that? Do you think I should venture producing on my own more or focus on finding someone who already has the skill and complete the vision that I have already here on paper?

I should also note that I have a full time 9-5 job, so having the time/energy to embark on this producing journey is also what discourages me to even attempt all of this because it‚Äôs not something you can learn overnight.

""Yeah man! People will love it!""
I feel just winging it is more the house party scene.
I tell him we need to learn structure, proper timing, etc. and one of the best ways is to learn covers...which he has a hard time accepting.
I'm all for just making unstructured swirling sounds but I think artists of all facets through time and they certainly studied the masters seriously. The Renaissance painters used to literally copy master paintings. Some writers have copied word for word their heroes if only just to ""feel"" it. And of course Beatles and Dylan and many many others started mainly doing covers.

i'm a 18 yo European guy and i've been playing for 4 years. i'm mainly a singer and i'm part of a pop punk duo where i sing and play bass. we're not very good, but we've already made a few songs and we've been playing together since 09/23. before that i was part of a few bands where i was the lead singer, but we sucked and broke up quickly. this project seems to be going well, but we don't really know how to continue. i have many contacts of professional (and non pro) musicians, but the bottom line is that we can't get a song done and make it sound good; we want to play just as a duo, but the midi drums suck and we don't know how to mix. I know my path is to become an artist, i've always needed to express myself constantly and i'm a musician because i don't know anything else. But something stops us from being as good as the pop punk bands we listen to were 20 years ago.

875,Undergrad Music Degree - Do I Finish?,11,musicians,23,"Hi there,

I am four semesters into a university music degree that would take me two more semesters to finish. 

I feel that I‚Äôve learned most of what I came to learn (theory and ear training, especially the fundamentals since I am mostly interested in pop music) and am not really enjoying myself anymore. 

I have little interest in analyzing any more classical pieces as I am not a classical musician and do not play piano nearly well enough to even perform any of the pieces we are analyzing in theory class at this point. I enjoy playing piano (not my main instrument) and plan to keep working on my piano playing, just feel that what I‚Äôm being asked to do theoretically is so far ahead of my playing ability that I see little value in it at this point. 

The ear training class has moved into the realm of atonal music and I am equally uninterested in that. I plan to keep working on my ear regardless, however, as I realize how important it is for what I want to do.  

As far as music history, I feel that I‚Äòd rather read books about it than take classes where I need to write papers and analyze old pieces which I am not really interested in.  

I currently make most of my income from performing music/gigging and none of the music I play (mostly pop/rock) has much to do with what we do in school, where it‚Äôs just classical and jazz. I‚Äòm primarily a drummer, by the way. 

I also record/produce music and hope to grow that into a bigger stream of income over the next few years. I do not feel that the music program I am in directly helps me do that either. Theory and ear training are obviously super important for that but I feel that it‚Äôs mostly the fundamentals that are crucial, as most popular music tends to be rather simple in terms of harmony, etc. 

What do you guys think‚Ä¶should I stick it out for two more semesters after this one or do I call it quits after this semester? 

How important is getting the degree/piece of paper?

Oh by the way, I already have a Bachelor‚Äòs degree so this would be a second one, albeit one in music, which I suppose could be a requirement for getting a teaching job in music. I don‚Äôt necessarily see myself teaching unless I need the money, however. 

Would really appreciate some input. "

I've been complimented before but I don't feel like people are being honest and that they have an alterior motive like the man that abused me before. Its tainted my passion for anything and it's taken me years to get back to my other hobbies. I feel sick at the sight of my drum kit but I long for it at the same time. Can anyone help?

890,How many of you are affected by tinnitus and how did it change your life as a musician?,13,musicians,16,"Hey guys,



I want to talk with you about a ""unpleasant"", but necessary topic, namely hearing protection and tinnitus.



TLDR: What is your experience with tinnitus? Did it stop you from doing music? Do you think its an unreasonable risk joining a metal band with chronic tinnitus with good, custom earplugs?

I\`m one of the lucky ones, who got chronic tinnitus from a metal concert in 2020. Yeah, I went to a good amount of shows/clubs in my life before that, wore a lot of headphones. Still, I was aware of the risks and tried to keep the volume reasonable and even started using some cheap musician ear plugs in the year before that.

Turns out that wasn't enough. It was one of the loudest shows I¬¥ve ever been to and next day, tinnius was insanely loud. Of cause, it didn't stay that loud, but also never completly went away. Also, it seems like I have slight hearing loss on my right side. A slight dip at the higher frequencies, but nothing that affects my life right now.

The impact on my mental health has been mixed....Luckily, most of the time, if I stay busy and there is background noise, I dont notice it at all or not that much. But every few weeks, there come a few days, where I completly fixate on it and start to become depresses, anxious and worried. Affects my ability to sleep and concentrate....what if it will get worse? Stuff like that.



At first I was very afraid of going to concerts, but got some custom molded earplugs from a professional store with the maximum filter.

https://preview.redd.it/4j9fn5yggarc1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa6a37995356f0fe7e7a9d74511e5ea06797a784

I¬¥ve been hesitant at first cause I was very afraid of making the tinnitus worse, but since 2020 I¬¥ve been to like 2 concerts and a few times clubbing. Luckily, these plugs offered enough protection and afterwards I didnt have the feeling my tinnitus got worse.



Now, the reason why I am actually texting this. I started a metal band with some friends (I play guitar) and we already wrote a good amount of songs. But I kind of start to get worried, that I will permanently fuck up my ears even more and may and up at a point, where my tinnitus becomes unbearable.

Normally you could argue like ""okay, the band plays around 100-105dB. The earplugs reduce the noise exposure by 20-30 dB to around 70-90 dB. The time for safe listening of 90 dB, which would be the most pessemistic scenario, would be 4 hours. So probaly I¬¥d be fine if we play one gig per week.

But since my ears already took some permanent damage and hearing damage is cumulative, I am afraid my hearing might be more prone for further damage compared to normal people.

I¬¥m in a tough spot right now, since I feel like I have to make a decision between following my dream of playing in a metal band and risking potentially life ruining tinnitus, or giving up on it, in order to avoid this risk.

I¬¥ll definetly talk with an ENT and audiologist about it, but I assume some of you may had such kind of thoughts or experiences with the topic, that might help be guide my decision.



If you read on r/tinnitus....some people say they still go to shows etc, because they feel safe when using earplugs. But others made their tinnitus permenantly worse and advice against any kind of super loud environment. It¬¥s really depressing to read some of these storys.

So, I¬¥d be thankfull for any insight you could share on the topic.

Thanks in advance and all the best to you.

892,Vocal strain when playing with live drums - need tips,1,musicians,6,"Whenever I perform with a live drummer, I end up pushing my voice too hard to compensate for how loud the drums are, leading to vocal strain + pitchiness. I have a softer voice & although I can project, I lose vocal dynamics when I'm fixated on staying loud. The other night at a show I even had my drummer put moongels on his cymbals to mitigate the higher frequencies - still, the same issue! I'm not sure how much of this is a mixing issue, as I always try to coordinate with the sound person to prioritize my vocal levels. 

Any tips for how I can proceed? Do I ask my drummer to play softer (he's super adaptable & would do it if I asked but it also feels sacrilege to ask a drummer to do that)? Do I try in-ears again (which I ditched because the last time I wore them, I couldn't even hear my own voice)? Do I pick vocal lessons back up to improve my technique / stamina / power? I just want to be able to sing as well as I do when I'm not up against drums."

903,Looking for a metronome app that may not exist.,3,musicians,10,"Hello musicians, I am a professional keyboardist but have some serious imposter syndrome because my rhythmic precision has always been lacking to at least some extent. I am improving by practicing often with a metronome but sometimes I still struggle even with the metronome. 
When I practice on MIDI keyboard through my DAW I often use a plugin (can‚Äôt remember the name off the top of my head but I think it might be ‚ÄúMIDI Rhythm Trainer‚Äù) that gives you live visual feedback of where (or when) you are playing each note relative to the beat. It‚Äôs a fantastic tool that is helping me a lot, because I can look at it and see ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm hitting these notes behind the beat, these other notes way in front of the beat,‚Äù etc‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a super useful plugin and if anyone is interested I can figure out what it‚Äôs called next time I‚Äôm at my laptop although I think it may be available only with Reaper. 
It‚Äôs great when I‚Äôm practicing on my midi keyboard, however I also want to improve my rhythmic accuracy on my guitars and on my pipe organ, which I can‚Äôt plug into with a midi cable. I wonder if there exists any sort of smart app on IOS or even some sort of hardware that can do what I‚Äôm describing, except by analyzing audio instead of MIDI. I‚Äôve looked and looked and I can‚Äôt seem to find anything like that. It‚Äôs very possibly that it‚Äôs simply too much to ask for lol. It would have to be very good at analyzing audio. 
I know I can keep improving by continuing to practice how I am, but I think something like this would speed up my progress a bit. If you‚Äôre not aware of anything like this or if it doesn‚Äôt exist, share your favorite metronome app on IOS or otherwise! Regardless, I‚Äôm in the market for a new one. For many years I‚Äôve used the Pro Metronome app that I know is very popular, and I love many of its features and tools but I‚Äôd like something that allows you to save a lot of presets, to help me keep track of where I‚Äôm at in different songs and what subdivisions and accents etc. I use for them.

So here's my question: I've seen people using those cheap lavalier mics for spoken-word content and podcasting, and they sound surprisngly good to me. Has anyone ever used one to record music? Do you think one of those Boya lavaliers would sound better than my smartphone camera (Galaxy S8), enough to justify $15-20? I can afford that but honestly not much else.

919,The thin line between Producer / Mixer / Co-writer,1,musicians,6,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The definition of music producer has changed much over the past 30 years. Most literature I have found doesn't seem to be able to define what a producer is objectively. In the effort to understand the roles of a producer, a co-writer, and a mixer, I present you with 2 scenarios. 

&#x200B;

Scenario 1:

&#x200B;

Bob writes and records several songs. Bob has written complete songs with all lyrical content, vocal and music melodies, and chord progressions. He has recorded several guitars, bass, layered vocals, and composed the midi drums. Afterwards, he sends the songs to be mixed by Joe. 

&#x200B;

Joe receives Bob's stems and mixes them for the final product. In addition to adjusting volume and EQ levels, adding reverb and other effects, using pitch correction, etc., Joe also:

\- adds some synth bass on a few tracks

\- alters some drum beats

\- adds percussion and brass section on a track

\- adds background effects like swells, bass drops, other effects to add ambience

\- double's up a chorus

\- stops the music on certain sections to make a vocal line stand out

\- extends or reduces the length of a bridge, outro, or intro

&#x200B;

All of these creative changes are approved by Bob. 

&#x200B;

What Joe does NOT do:

\- add new chord progressions

\- add new melodies

\- add new lyrics

\- make any changes without the approval and collaboration of Bob

&#x200B;

What is Joe's role in this scenario? Is he operating only as a mixer? Or is he a co-writer and/or producer as well?

&#x200B;

Scenario 2:

&#x200B;

Mary has written several parts of songs on one instrument. She has chord progressions for verses, choruses, bridges, lyrics, vocal melodies. However she has trouble putting them into a final arrangement, and is unsure of which parts fit together and belong together in a song. She asks Sue for her help in this process. 

&#x200B;

Sue listens to all of Mary's parts. Sue accompanies her on another instrument during the process of arranging the pieces. Sue performs the following functions:

\- determines which chord progressions and lyrics should serve as verse, chorus, and bridge

\- adds a piano or guitar lead line over a few choruses and an intro

\- takes a verse from another intended song and turns it into a bridge for a different song

\- turns a verse from one song into a chorus for another song

\- changes a guitar strumming section into picking instead

\- changes a guitar strumming chord progression into an arpeggiating piano piece (same chord progression)

\- adds a few buildups for bridge sections or last choruses (using same chord progressions)

\- records a demo with Mary and adds drums, piano, bass, and lead guitar 

\- asks Mary to sing an octave higher or lower for a certain section

\- adds vocal harmonies to several sections

\- adds back-up vocal ""oohs and ahhs""

&#x200B;

What Sue does NOT do:

\- add new chord progressions

\- add new lyrics

\- add new lead vocal melodies

\- make any changes without the approval and collaboration of Mary

&#x200B;

What is Sue's role in this scenario? Is she an arranger, producer, co-writer? None of the above? All of the above?

&#x200B;

I'm looking for the most objective, by-the-book answer - as if we were sitting down with a music business attorney - what would he/she say?

&#x200B;

Please only respond if you have performed similar roles to the above in the creation of recorded and released songs. 

&#x200B;

Thank you. "
920,Deep Purple - Space Truckin' Bass Cover,1,musicians,0,"This week, one of my favourite Deep Purple songs. Enjoyed covering this one to the fullest, however it needed a month worth of practice. Plus you never go wrong with Ritchie Blackmore worship, there is a lot to gain. One of the bands where I praise the guitarist more than the bassist, though I love Roger Glover quite a lot as well, but Ritchie is god. 

All the musicians are perfect on the song, the drums are great, the drum solo is an underrated one. I enjoy the drumming of Ian Paice, vocals are awesome too. For me, a song way ahead of its time. 

Roger follows the guitars on this quite a bit on this one, except on the bridge. The song flows throughout the body of the bass, like riding or truckin' through the space. Lot of fluctuations, highs and lows, a ride every bassist covering this one would enjoy for sure, I enjoyed it more than I usually enjoy. The bass solo is pretty simple, but precise. The rhythm Roger carries on this one is very godly,  there are parts where the bass goes on its own and the drums goes separately, for example before the bass solo, it can be tough and at the same time good for building your own rhythm.

This one was a challenge, played along all the strings and across the fretboard, with fast switches.  Roger used a lot of accents in his playing. The rhythm of the song can get confusing for new musicians and more than any other thing, the mini bass solo in the bridge requires speed and precision. So a great one to practice and step up the playing. 

Genre - Heavy Metal / Space rock
Original Bassist - Roger Glover
From the album 'Machine Head'

Like if I know people around my circle need a piano player, they'll call him and not think of me. I know this is weird but idk i cant hell it (im really insecure overall).
Once I saw him live and seeing everyone clap for him and say ""wow he's so talented, amazing, one of the best"" really brought me down, like ""hey, that couzkd be me and it isn't"". The name thing is also kinda weird for me cuz whenever someone says my name they're mostly talking about him and i feel weird.
I feel like whenever i see his stories playing  recording, and whatever bring me down when im not doing anything.

If you want to listen to what I made: [https://www.youtube.com/@flitfall](https://www.youtube.com/@flitfall) If you‚Äôre going to listen to my songs, skip ahead of the bad intros and ignore Becoming Crazy, I only made that song to learn how to use Garageband. Not necessarily asking for feedback or trying to promote.

There is something that has been bothering me lately. I make unique electronic instrumentals with just the default instruments and effects Garageband on a mobile device(not the problem). I understand my songs have bad mixing, unprofessional instruments, awful intros, awful SEO, and repeat the same thing for too long, but I still liked them, and so did my friends. I though A Distant Place was absolutely beautiful and that The Mirror had a lot of energy when I first released them. While I‚Äòm not too serious about music, there is one thing that bothers me: after one year, I have only gotten worse!

A few years ago, before I had an interest in making music, I could sit down for 5 minutes and compose an amazing song in my head. All of the times I did that, I never forgot what I made and I loved it. Unfortunately, I only did this a few times, and these songs require vocals and specific instruments, so the closest thing I was able to make to one of these songs was Heartstripped.

The first time I decided to use Garageband, I was amazed at how easily I could compose beautiful melodies and songs without any prior experience. Those melodies weren‚Äôt amazing, but I could totally see room for improvement. Up until Encryptia, making these songs that I wanted to post came so easily. The real first song I made and posted on youtube was Dimensions, and despite the bad mixing and over-repetitive structure, I thought it was beautiful. I was able to listen to Futures, my 2nd song multiple times, all the way through, and I never got bored of it. A Distant Place is probably my favorite song of mine, although it was a symbolic form of self-expression for the emotions I‚Äôve been going through at that time. I actually once believed that, with a few finishing touches, Encryptia or A Distant Place could be on par with 647 by Instupendo. After releasing Futures, so many great melodies and songs started popping into my head at random times of the day.

Unfortunately, the best ones only came when I couldn‚Äôt record them. There was just one problem with that: Every time I started a new project, I was quickly bored by what I made. Whether I improvised or tried to make something I recorded, I either had no way to finish it without vocals, with my current tools, or, most often, it just sounded super boring no matter what I did. I have literally hundreds of unfinished songs, and as time went on, those unfinished songs got worse and worse. The melodies that popped into my head at random times got worse and worse. Every aspect of my music-production has gotten worse. Often, it was impossible for me to finish a song because, no matter how I changed it, I just didn‚Äôt have the desire to finish it because it was so boring. It‚Äôs annoying having LITERALLY 5 FLUKES IN A ROW just to find out you will never be able to make songs better than those.

Is this a normal thing for many artists to go through? I‚Äôve seen multiple times online that these experiences happen sometimes, but my experience just seems so extreme and unnatural that the only conclusion I can come to is that, if you compared the musical potential of everyone on Earth, I would be in the bottom 10%. Like, 1 year, 50 views, no good songs? How? Although my intros are terrible and my songs(mixing, instruments, and thumbnail) are too unprofessional for any random person to take it seriously, a truly good song should get at least 200 views and 5 likes. If every song by the Weeknd was made as an instrumental with bad mixing, bad intros, awful SEO, and unprofessional instruments like my songs, would they still be significantly more popular than my songs? Just listen to any song by Temporex and hear how absolutely beautiful it is compared to my music which lies in the 50-100 view abyss. Temporex isn‚Äôt a rich pop star who uses tons of expensive effects and instruments, he‚Äôs a teenager who made something beautiful with what he had. I know he‚Äôs talented, but I just can‚Äôt do the same."

931,Is it polite to ask local band for their arrangements?,13,musicians,15,"Hello musicians. 

I have a bit shy question. 

I really like one local band, it is swing-jazz trio, three beautiful talented ladies playing violin, ukulele, guitar and singing 1920s-1940s music. It is their side hustle, primarily working as professional singers at biggest (and only) swing orchestra in capital city.

Some of songs from that era are composed by Slovak composers (or orchestra, or singer-songwriters) and it is impossible to find music sheets for that, especially for ukulele. It is not like ""Yes sir that's my baby"" or ""It's only Paper Moon"" which is virtually everywhere. I looked in music shops, asked studied musicologists, asked teachers, crawled internet, nope, no luck at all. 

I really want to play and sing some of that by myself or with kids but I can not play them as (theoretically) precise as they. Yes, most of music of that era is II-V-I but all those voicings are making it just right. 

I saw them live, they have some papers in front of them, they read some music while playing...  Is it polite to write them and asked them for arrangement? I would gladly buy them, maybe some CDs, merch.... I am spoiled by youtubers who offer their sheets to buy online (or on patreon).

a simple disclaimer: I have no intention making money with music or be some competition or steal from them. It's their job, for me it is only a sweet hobby at home.

How would you react if I wrote that request to you?

932,How do I pursue more music? ,1,musicians,6,"To anybody willing to offer a few words of wisdom, I‚Äôm an amateur cellist who played all throughout the public school system whose recently rekindled the passion through private zoom lessons. And I‚Äôm looking at what could be next for my music ‚Äúcareer.‚Äù I‚Äôve been the lessons for nearly two years weekly and have much improved. I‚Äôm 28 and I work for the FAA controlling air traffic, and my work schedule is rotating but has regular days off. And my usual work day has around 4 hours of break time that I can do whatever I wish. I either go to the gym in the facility where I work, read a book, or play the cello. I had a Yamaha SVC210 I would bring to work that unfortunately was stolen in a break in. But playing music on my breaks always felt like my favorite use of my time. 

My first and most important question Is music school possible for me? I ask about schooling specifically I have such a huge urge to learn and be immersed in a musical environment. I‚Äôm done training at my job and my career with the FAA is essentially a coast from here on out if I wish. I could do details here and there but there‚Äôs nothing quite like another mountain to climb like pursuing the cello. 

The school in question is the University of Puget Sound since I live in the Seattle area. 

If not‚Ä¶

Community orchestra maybe? Playing small gigs as an amateur? Selling feet pics with my cello in the foreground? "
933,Am I right to get mad at my band for not moving our gig,0,musicians,138,"I'm a drummer. We booked our first gig at a venue that is held by our singer's friends (it's not a musical venue, but we will play our solo show there). 

A week after booking this date I get a phone call from a close friend whom I don't get to see often, inviting me to a birthday party. He lives in a different city. 

SINCE the situation is as follows: 

* This is our first gig basically for friends
* Venue is free almost every weekend, so moving is not a problem
* Currently our band is not commercial at all 

I thought I would ask my band to move this gig to another weekend. There's a lot of background personal info why going to this bday is important for me, but yeah. Long story short - they won't move it. Reason - they just don't want to do it. 

I am really invested in this band, I write riffs and am genuinely passionate about creating music. However this situation really pissed me off. I DO UNDERSTAND that initially, I am at wrong here and I am asking people to make up for my poor planning. BUT I genuinely don't get why the heck is this a problem to move this show, since there is no LEGIT reason for not doing it. 

Now I am a bit confused why my personal relationships should get affected by something that is supposed to be done for pleasure - I'm afraid that will create tension within a band to a point of me not being able to enjoy it anymore. 

I'm looking for a reality check. Thanks. "

I‚Äôm constantly stressed out and overwhelmed and broke and feel guilty when I‚Äôm not working on my never ending to do list of working on writing songs or practices or video content or marketing or playlisting or merch or tours etc etc. Of course I know nothing worth while is going to be easy, but I feel so stuck in this loop of restless discontent all the time.

I'm getting alot of love in my hometown. hundreds of shares and thousands of views on my music videos, and posts, and just broke 1500 streams on Spotify with 88 Playlist adds. I want to know what is working for you!! I'm happy to share my experience and process and what had worked for me. I'm real big on Positivity and teamwork and want to watch everyone in my network grow and find success. My goal is to get on more Spotify playlists, collaborate with other artists. and just be heard and felt. Music is my passion and I use it as a tool to spread love, inspiration, and entertainment. Here's what's worked for me so far and what hasn't.
I started promoting 4 months ago, 1 month before my first single release. I made short videos and pictures with professionally taken photos and preview audio of my music then posted different content twice a week on Facebook, tiktok, Instagram, Twitter, tumbler, pinterest, snapchat, linked in, SoundCloud, bandlab, and YouTube. Then I distributed 3 singles every 3 weeks on every major platform including Spotify, apple, Amazon, deezer... ect...
I then shot and released 3 music videos, one for each single and paid $1500 for ads on Facebook, ig, tik tok, and YouTube. The ads got around 250,000 views, 7,000 new followers and a lot of love. I also spent $300 on Submithub submitting to playlist curators. About 120 of the 150 submissions were denied for different songs. 40 of then were accepted and I got added to 25 playlists, 5 blogs, 5 radio stations, and 5 haven't been shared yet. Not as good as I was expecting but still something. I also searched the emails of 200 Spotify curators and send emailed the requesting to be added to thier playlists with short and sweet descriptions of the songs and links to the music. Only about 20 of them responded and 18 of them wanted me to pay $20 - $50 for playlisting. 2 of them tried to get my credit card info to scam me lol. I've seen alot of paid playlisting is done with fake bots and didn't want to use them and get my Spotify banned. So emails were a bust. 
 I just released my debut full album 2 days ago with 11 songs and not sure what else to do to promote it then what I'm currently doing. I've sold  28 CDs and 4 Vinyls record in the first 2 days and got a out 600 plays on Spotify. 
And yes I know these are decent results, and many will say to keep pushing and it'll work out. And I agree, but after putting my heart and soul into this project, I just want to make sure there's nothing I'm missing and I'm doing everything I can. I'm also not sure how to get played on radio stations so that would helpful too. I've reached out to DJs with no responses. Any advice is appreciated. Much love ‚ô•Ô∏èü§òüé∂"

948,"Old friend starting A.I. ""Project""...Am I being petty?",63,musicians,173,"An old friend I've known for a long time (we used to be much closer) has just started experimenting/creating music with A.I. Music Generators. He's not a musician at all - he can come up with some decent melodies sometimes vocally, but can't sing or play an instrument to save his life. He knows I've personally been writing and performing music seriously for the last 20+ years - I'm not even that great at it, but I've worked hard, and I love music as a release and a hangout with my band members.

I get it, this A.I. stuff is going to be part of our world for the forseeable future, so do what makes you happy in your own home. The problem I have is, he's sending me (bragging about) all of these A.I. songs via DM and I don't know how to respond. I'm kinda just like, ""Cool man, technology is pretty neat"", and leave it at that, pretty much ignore the rest of his messages rambling about how hard he worked on these songs of his. He's a really insecure dude, so saying something shitty to him would probably set him off bigtime.

Look, the songs are just horrible, as you could probably understand. Not even that it's not my style of music, but just has that lifeless, robotic, generic sound. He plans on releasing dozens of these songs ASAP.  I'm still OK with this, I can ignore him for the most part.

Now he's turning this into a whole ""project"". He has new artwork, press releases, and even merch...all from A.I. Generators. Not a single ounce of effort other than pressing a few keystrokes. He's on top of the world in his mind making this fake music and blasting it all over his socials as the next big thing that's going to revolutionize the music industry. I could post some of the PR, it would make you gag. People are lifting him up saying how proud they are of him and his brilliant efforts (non-musicians, I'm sure).  My friends and I are sitting here like, hmmmm, really?

Am I being petty about this? Should I even care? I'm not losing sleep over it, but I don't know how to gently let him know that it's pretty damn annoying that I'm out here creating multiple times a week and he's pumping this garbage out with the click of a button. I'll probably just let it fizzle out, though.

Maybe I just needed to air it out and see if anyone here is dealing with a similar thing in their world.

EDIT: Thanks for all the great suggestions and experiences.I've gotten a handful of requests to hear the A.I. songs. I figured at this point it would be OK to upload the songs anonymously to a public Dropbox and Google link if you're curious and want to hear what these sound like. (I'm kinda new to Reddit, so I don't know of there's a better file server I should use).

It's a bunch of songs in one file so you'll have to skip around. You'll get the idea. Obviously some quality loss from downloading from Youtube to MP3, etc.

953,Why you should always eat the mic!,28,musicians,15,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm a pro FOH sound engineer. I work for a couple national touring acts and many local venues that host pro acts. I‚Äôve mixed a couple thousand shows so far in my life. I‚Äôve come to this sub to set the record straight on something I see a lot on Reddit about mic technique.

One of the prevailing schools of thought is that a singer should ‚Äúwork the mic,‚Äù meaning they should move closer when singing softer and further away when louder.  This technique arose in an era of woefully underpowered and unwieldy PA systems susceptible to distortion and feedback. This technique made perfect sense for the time. 

These days, with modern PAs and digital processing, ‚Äúworking the mic‚Äù has become an antiquated technique for the majority of performers, and actually creates a very significant problem.

When a singer sings louder, the tonal balance almost always becomes brighter, with more upper midrange harmonics coming through. When a singer sings softer, there are less upper harmonics coming through.

The proximity effect of cardioid mics means that the closer you are, the more low and low mid frequencies are present. Let‚Äôs call them fundamental frequencies.

One of the main goals of the FOH engineer is to preserve a tonal balance between the fundamental frequencies of the voice and the upper harmonics.

The problem with working a mic like this is that when a singer is singing soft AND super close, the fundamental frequencies are so overweighted that the engineer will have to drastically cut those frequencies to achieve tonal balance.  Then when the singer sings loud and far away from the mic, the tonal balance at the microphone changes DRASTICALLY in favor of the upper harmonics, with very little fundamental frequencies, requiring the opposite sort of EQ curve.

Such a phenomenon can be solved to some degree via use of multiband dynamics processing, but as with any dynamics processing, the harder you work it, the less gain before feedback you have.  A singer being off the mic more than an inch or two also further reduces gain before feedback.  The combination of these factors reduces the effectiveness of MB comp or dynamic EQ to the point that it only becomes a viable solution on the nicest most modern PAs with the highest gain before feedback (typically outdoors).

However, eating the mic consistently increases gain before feedback enough to offset the loss from heavy handed dynamics processing, allowing an appropriate tonal balance to be achieved consistently, regardless of the volume of the singer.

I should note that the ‚Äúwork the mic‚Äù technique can, at times, be used effectively.  If the artist has a very low stage volume (like piano and jazz vocalist, with very talented and experienced performers), it can be used subtly for emphasis on certain phrases, etc. There are always exceptions to the rule, but the VAST majority of performers (even pros) who do it, overwork the mic quite a bit.

In live sound, the entire game is getting soft things loud enough. If you take away 50-75% of your possible input volume by singing off mic, it‚Äôs just a losing game.  I‚Äôve attached a graph that illustrates the inverse square law of sound. You can see that the volume lost in those first few inches away from the mic is immense. I‚Äôm inclined to think that when people work the mic, they assume that the volume into the mic has a linear relationship to the distance the mic is away from them, when in reality that relationship is logarithmic.

In ear monitoring can further exacerbate these problems by giving the singer a false sense of their own volume input into the mic.

I just mixed a show last night where the singer for the opening band was mic shy and the whole mix sounded notably worse than the headliner (who ate the mic all night). I basically could only put the kick drum and vocal in the PA for the opener because even after intense ringing out the room and getting the vocal mic ear-splittingly loud, the vocal was still barely audible over the stage sound.   Shame, because the band was really good, and if the singer just sang into the goddamn mic, it would‚Äôve been great!

TLDR:  the majority of the time, by singing off mic or overworking the mic, you take away all of the engineer‚Äôs tools and they are forced to try to balance the mix by turning everything else down, much to everyone‚Äôs chagrin.  

Almost everyone who works the mic overworks it and would be better off just eating the mic, assuming the mix is in the hands of a competent engineer. "

And honestly it's absolutely fucking terrifying to release. I myself don't think that it's the absolute best song that I could've made, but I really wanted to release it, to test waters. When I was a kid I went to music school, always was shy, sang very quietly and non of my other teachers pushed me to get out of my comfort zone. My mom also once told me that I will never be able to have a music career. My friend made fun of me cause I was singing too much, said that I'm not as good as I think I am. And I never thought I was... my first ever boyfriend used to tell me to not sing low, cause I sound like a boy if I do. And today I had person comment on my song teaser, that I should quit ASAP. My current friends absolutely support me now, and even my parents do, mom too. Some try to push me a little so that I post more of myself singing, but all the words from my childhood are so stuck in my head that I just can't seem to shake the feeling that my friends and family are just being nice and that I'll be a laughing stock if I continue to do anything music related.

957,What should I do? Cancelling a gig with a replacement act lined up.,9,musicians,5,"So I (lead/ vocals) woke up two days before a smaller show at a local indie venue having completely lost my voice and tonsils so big I can't swallow. Two of my other band members also caught the same thing (we're a 4 piece band). I emailed the venue letting them know that we won't be able to go on, but that we're going to find another act in-genre that can take our spot. The next day, we found an act that was able to cover and emailed the venue, however, they haven't responded to us at all and we're still on the bill.

As I said, it's a smaller show on a Thursday night at 10:00, we were only expecting to bring around 10-15 people max. We've performed there before, everything went well, and we've maintained a good correspondence with the booker there.

I understand how much of an inconvenience this can be for the venue, which I why I got a replacement. I'm worried they won't book us again because of this. Did I do anything wrong and is there anything else I should do?

1. Don‚Äôt publish to all these unknown stores and getting your artist profile on all these platforms is a mess . I‚Äôve deleted releases, even some with 30k streams to just clean up my first album on 15 stores. I use Distrokid . 

2. Now I‚Äôm just going Spotify and Apple , but trying to claim prior publishing  YouTube, Amazon, etc 

3. Tik tok and Instagram music . Why ? Well you can post and use your music as a clip. Don‚Äôt see any other value though.  

4. Do it yourself Mix and master anxiety:  It‚Äôll never be good enough for a certain type  of musician. I‚Äôve spent weeks on a mix and it never quite meets my expectations. I don‚Äôt have the skills or experience to reach the perfection level desired. Just do your best . Don‚Äôt forget that certain instruments should be mono as bass, vox, rhythm guitar,  and sometimes lead guitar and drums (depends , I like loud drums and have advanced drum and guitar  mix options) 

5. Genres: f_ck genres, play what you feel. I have mostly rock, but I also have tracks that could be metal, folk, singer songwriter, alternative , and even a couple ballads . 

6. Singles are better than albums . I release an album after 5-6 singles . Why ? Putting out an album just buries tracks, who‚Äôs gonna listen to an album of an unknown? A single has better promo options .  I put out the album after the singles and maybe a single edit or EP version . 

7. Mixea: buy the annual pass . It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt have great mastering on S1 and pro tools but mixea is key .

What do  musicians who really know their stuff think about musicians that do the bare minimum?,45,musicians,103,"I ask because I‚Äôve gotten lots of feedback about myself over the years from many different people. I taught myself to play when I was a teenager because I was bursting with the desire to express my emotions. I‚Äôve gotten a lot better over the years but I keep things very simple. My guitar playing is terrible, my piano skills are mediocre but people like the emotion I put into my lyrics and voice.

My vocal instrument got much better over time but I was getting positive reactions even when I was technically a terrible singer. I‚Äôve gotten many compliments from musicians over the years, I even convinced a couple to let me be the frontman of my own band- musicians who were much much much better than myself.

I have gotten the biggest compliments and biggest criticisms days apart. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm offending actually talented artists when crowds respond positively to me. I‚Äôm asking because I‚Äôm genuinely confused to what actually makes someone ‚Äútalented‚Äù. I just consider myself to be passionate about expressing myself through music.

987,Seeking Advice: Should I Audition for The Voice Australia as a Metal Vocalist?,1,musicians,2,"Hey everyone,

I've been grappling with a dilemma lately and I could really use some advice from fellow musicians or anyone familiar with the music industry, particularly when it comes to reality TV singing competitions like The Voice Australia.

Let me give you a bit of background: I've been a performer for as long as I can remember, with singing being my primary passion. I've always leaned towards heavy metal, drawing a lot of inspiration from Oli Sykes, the lead vocalist of Bring Me The Horizon. My vocal style is heavily influenced by his, involving false chords, screams, and growls. Suffice to say, I love belting out those intense metal tunes.

Now, here's the thing: I've been urged by friends and family to audition for The Voice Australia. They seem to think my voice could really make an impact on the show. But here's my hesitation - the majority of contestants on The Voice seem to lean towards mainstream pop, and while I respect that genre, it's just not where my heart lies.

I've also heard that the show is heavily scripted in terms of song choice and wardrobe, and contestants don't even get to choose their audition pieces. This has me worried because I can't imagine being comfortable singing a pop song that doesn't resonate with me, or worse, one I've never even heard before.

I've noticed that in European versions of The Voice, there seem to be more opportunities for rock and metal vocalists, but I'm specifically interested in the Australian edition.

So, here's where I turn to you, Reddit community. Have any of you been on The Voice or have insights into how it operates behind the scenes? Is it worth it for someone like me to audition, knowing my vocal style isn't typical for the show? And if you've been in a similar position, how did you navigate it?

I'm open to any advice, suggestions, or personal experiences you can share. Thanks in advance for your help!"

I‚Äôm unsure if I should:

A) stop the song and either start again or just go back a line.

Or 

B) carry on and hope I can gain control again 

I understand that sometimes the audience don‚Äôt even notice this (if it‚Äôs minor) but I just wanted some advice on what to do in this situation.
Of course if it‚Äôs a gig you might start the song again (depending on how far you are through it) but at an open mic I can understand that it might be a bit annoying if you start a song all over again. "

1,I earned over $100k in 2023 as an independent solo musician playing restaurants,744,musicians,268,"My situation: 
I live in a pretty large city (Atlanta) and I gig 5+ times a week.  I have 2 regular residencies at hotel lobby bars on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  I always try for corporate gigs on Thurs/Fri/Sat but will play bars/restaurants if not available.  I‚Äôm also sometimes occupied with family stuff on these days.  I have a steady (paid) church gig every Sunday and also sometimes brunch gigs. 

With the guaranteed $$ from the hotels  and church + tips + additional bar gigs + the occasional high paying corporate gigs, I average close to $2k/week.  I was a school teacher for 20 years and quit 2 years ago to do music full time.  This is the first year that I have grossed over $100k.  This is of course pre-tax but I am very diligent about saving 20% so I‚Äôm ahead of the game for tax time.  I also own/manage a party band (my day job) and I earned an additional $35k from that.  So, I am ridiculously grateful to be making a comfortable living in the music business in my 40s.  

I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm pretty introverted (another reason to quit teaching) so I really enjoy the solo musician thing, and because I do a looping one-man-jam-band kind of thing, I can keep myself pretty entertained at a slow gig.  So, I don‚Äôt feel burnt out at all.  

I feel like if there is any advice to give, it would just be all the obvious things: show up on time, regularly practice and work on your craft, play/sing well, have reliable gear, tip bartenders, treat people with respect‚Ä¶ kind of all the obvious facets of being a professional and treating music like any professional job.  

Writing this post just to point out that this is a very realistic scenario and I would be interested in any discussion it provokes."

I‚Äôm constantly stressed out and overwhelmed and broke and feel guilty when I‚Äôm not working on my never ending to do list of working on writing songs or practices or video content or marketing or playlisting or merch or tours etc etc. Of course I know nothing worth while is going to be easy, but I feel so stuck in this loop of restless discontent all the time. Never feel like I‚Äôm doing enough and somehow always working on something. 

Wondering if anyone has any advice on how to keep following the path without burnout or trying a different approach that lets them enjoy life again.

I don‚Äôt want to give up my dreams, but I‚Äôm afraid the pursuit is going to make my life suck.

9,Played my final live show,430,musicians,310,"I've been playing shows for the last 29 years including multiple tours throughout the USA, but last night was my final show.

When I first started playing shows, I fantasized about growing an audience, having been told that the more you do it, the better it gets. I played basements, rock clubs, art galleries, record stores, festivals, you name it. My band released records on a big indie label and has been reviewed in just about every magazine or website you can think of. We had a few really good, memorable shows throughout the years but our final tour was a disaster. If we had 5 people come to the show, it was a good night. When we got back home, we played a low key local show and exactly one person came.

In the early days, I thrived on playing to a few people in a basement. I had something to prove and cherished the opportunity to win over and connect with an audience, no matter how small. We even played a show to absolutely nobody because it was just fun to play! When we played that show to one person after decades of playing local and tour gigs, it hit me- I can't do it anymore. It hurt my feelings too much to continue. I shared my feelings with the other band members and we all agreed. We would continue to make records, but playing shows is a thing of the past.

I continued to play little tiny solo shows here and there, figuring that because it wasn't with my band, I wouldn't have any feelings tied up in it. Last night's show put an end to that. None of our thousands of fans wanted to come see me play, which wasn't surprising, but it affected me in a way that I couldn't shake. The opener had a few friends who were stoked to see him, but I had nobody except my wife and kid.

I'm old. I'm tired of being disappointed. It's time to close that chapter in my life. It's a bummer, but I still love writing/recording music, so I'll keep my focus on that."

Last weekend my neighborhood had a block party with live music. The mic was opened up to the crowd and I just went for it. Performed needle and the damage done and knocking on heavens door (Dylan version). Pretty sure my voice sounded terrible and I definitely made mistakes on the guitar, but I had a ton of fun and my wife and kids got to watch me perform. 

I‚Äôve been riding a high all week and can‚Äôt wait to perform again. My only regret is that it took me this long to perform in public, so if your reading this and you‚Äôve even thought about performing in public, just go for it!

Edit: thanks to all that have commented. I really appreciate the kind words and encouragement. I also really appreciate those that shared their experiences‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure someone out their will read about our experience and gather the courage to go out and perform, and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about.

19,Possible reason on why so many pick up guitar and then quit immediately,322,musicians,561,"So i saw a study made by fender that said 90% of guitar players quit in the first year.

You have to do exercises, study scales, learn to arpeggiate and solo, and many people think you can just do all these things right out of the gate. Guitar is seen differently because of how America and even the world has gone through phases with it. We have had people like Eddie Van Halen become sex icons with their guitars in hand. People see it as this sick cool thing when really its some nerd shit that takes hundreds of hours to get a smidge better at. People pick up the guitar for the first time, try to play a song far outside their reach, have no other motivation or inspiration than playing Infront of chicks and looking cool, and decide that its not worth the effort and give up."
20,‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotten complaints about the volume.‚Äù,322,musicians,154,"   I did a mall gig playing piano last week and the mall staff kept telling me I was too loud, in stark contrast to every single customer walking by and store employees giving me thumbs up and encouraging comments. One customer was even present when the staff member told me to quiet down and actually told them off for me lol. I wouldn‚Äôt have been so direct myself. This is after I had closed the lid completely, used the soft pedal the whole time, and switched to soft easy listening music.
    
Seriously where to these people get off? It‚Äôs not the first time this has happened, it happens at restaurants too.
   
My dearest children, you set up a GRAND piano in an echo chamber, hired me after I sent in video clips and described clearly the kind of music that I play (Chopin, Liszt etc.), then complain about the noise? What do you want from me? Why waste money on a grand? Why waste money on my skills? Why have live music at all?
   
I know this is nothing new, but getting back into music after 10 years has made me much more aware of these things lately. The things we put up with for music.

Update: 
The mall manager who hired me responded. What she said: 
‚ÄúWhat? Who said it was too loud? I loved listening to your playing from my office! Some of the store managers want you to come back every day haha! I heard you drew quite the crowd too, we‚Äôd love to have you back. You won‚Äôt have to worry about volume, like I said I don‚Äôt know why you were told that. Let me know if you can!‚Äù 
I might actually go back now."

If you are unfamiliar, he‚Äôs a 6‚Äô8‚Äù dude dressed like a sad clown with an amazing voice. Anyway‚Ä¶he was walking through the audience while singing and a lady recording handed him her phone. He sang to the camera for a little bit, then saw someone else with a phone. He handed the original phone to a random person and took the next one. He continued doing this, just handing these phones to whoever was sitting there when he got the next one. We realized what was going on, but people just kept handing him phones. After the song, like 30 people stood up and frantically tried to figure out where their phone was. He put on this ‚Äúoops, what have I done‚Äù face and melted back into the stage curtains. He doesn‚Äôt speak at all in makeup and this was obviously all planned. It was hilarious and the people watching an entire concert through a screen deserved it all."

31,Every artist that wants to do this for a living needs to hear this,247,musicians,131,"I recently joined this subreddit and I see many people asking questions about the different aspects of making music, which are all very important ofcourse. 

However I did see a lot of people that are getting stuck on very tiny details regarding their songs, which is also understandable. 

Though, I feel like we as artists often get so consumed in the detail of our work that it paralyzes our ability to move forward.

The listener doesn't care about most the stuff a lot of artists are worried about. It might be an unpopular opinion but...

I think artists that actually want to do this full time at one point need to learn how to quickly create and move on to the next song. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.. The song you love, other people might hate.

Hence why it's better to put out work and discover what works along the way. Also, making music is one part, but marketing the music will be the most important thing if you ever want to make money from it.

For backstory, I have managed to gain a pretty large Soundcloud following of 23k people, sold many instrumentals on Youtube, worked with some ""big"" names in the industry out here in Europe and my music has been streamed 5-10 million times worldwide. 

The reason I really think this is important for upcoming artists that want to make a carreer out of it is because I have lost momentum at one point because I was a perfectionist, had I made sure to keep releasing and make content for Tiktok, IG etc. I would've been much further ahead right now.

Don't be your own worst enemy and try to get into the habit of releasing frequently and making Short Form content and improving on every aspect along the way.

You will thank me later I promise!"

38,Just a rant about the worst gig I ever had.,213,musicians,105,"Last Saturday I played a gig with a guy I used to have a band with years ago and as the title says it was literally the worst gig I‚Äôve ever done. 

He called me a month ago to say he procured a little gig at a community center event - four sets over two days with decent pay.  We could repeat a lot of material on the second day if we wanted to. 

I agreed because he and I still jam occasionally and we know a lot of songs together. 

First issue was that I‚Äôm drumming instead of playing bass.  That‚Äôs cool, I can hang with that.

At the first practice he informs us that he wants to do a bunch of new material.

We were having trouble getting everyone in the room at the same time.  No big deal, I‚Äôve pulled off lots of shows with little to no rehearsal.

We‚Äôre all seasoned musicians who have been playing for years and the material wasn‚Äôt actually difficult.  

And I was told that the women who is running the event would come up and sing a few of the new songs with us so nobody bothered  to fully learn the words. 

As the big day approached it became more and more obvious to me that it wasn‚Äôt going to go well but I figured we‚Äôd pull it off. 

Then the two days became one, which cut the pay in half. 

This last week I‚Äôve been coughing for several days and losing my voice.  I‚Äôve been drinking hot tea with honey and lemon multiple times a day.

The night before the show we were still learning and arranging material. 

On the way to the venue I almost totaled my car because some asshole missed his exit and cut in front of me.  I found myself navigating between two cars heading right for a guardrail and a sign. All the while a semi and an SUV were barreling up behind me horns blaring. 

It was pants-shitting scary but I survived. 

I managed to miss every obstacle in my way and bobbed and weaved through the chaos while my drum set was flying around behind me performing a ghost drum solo.

It‚Äôs a RIMS headset and it wasn‚Äôt secured very well. (My bad) and a cymbal arm and the tom mount on the bass drum both broke in the near-accident. 

It‚Äôs a kind of rare drum set from the 80‚Äôs and the parts will cost me more than I made at the gig.  

I set the kit up anyway.  

Then there was no power on the stage.

And then there was but it kept tripping the breakers.

The portable stage was powered by a generator and something kept tripping the breakers. 

And nobody brought a PA.  I was assured that the venue had a system we could play through but it was just two powered speakers, no mixer, no monitors. 

The thing is, I have a PA and I offered to bring it and set it up. All four members of the band own PA‚Äôs that we could have brought but no‚Ä¶they have a system there‚Ä¶

After over an hour of fucking around we cobbled together one microphone going through one speaker.

And then one of the guitarist‚Äôs amps quit working on the middle of a song.

By this point I was rethinking every life decision I‚Äôve ever made

The thing is, I saw it coming - the lack of rehearsal time, band members not familiar with the material, shitty equipment, crackly cables, wobbly-ass mic stands, guitars falling off of janky straps - you name it."

41,Friend got famous and I'm jealous? Advice?,204,musicians,314,"I'm not jealous - just frustrated :) It's frustrating to witness my friend's sudden rise to fame on TikTok. Overnight, he went from having 3K followers to a staggering 200K on Instagram and half a million on TikTok, with his Spotify garnering 10 million listeners and reaching the number 1 spot on global charts. 

I am genuinely pleased to see my friend experience this success because his songs are great. I am just frustrated and feeling hopeless because this success seemed entirely random; his song went viral without much effort or consistency on his part - he made the song, hasn't really been posting much TikToks and doesn't know much about marketing; just posted a TikTok (nothing special) and it popped off. While you may suggest it's an attestation that his success means others can do it too.. it's disheartening seeing other artists including this friend who have some other OUTSTANDING songs, market them so much, put so much effort into writing/production/marketing... and nothing happens. 

It feels like success in the music industry boils down to luck so much.... leaving us feeling demotivated and overlooked despite our efforts.

Anyone felt the same? Any advice?"

I‚Äôm a part of a Facebook group where a lot of people involved in the entertainment industry in the area can network with one another, and I tend to offer to play for free to help out the artists. I‚Äôve met people who I‚Äôve done gigs with through that group, so I‚Äôve long considered it a good resource.

However, the pattern as of late has been this:

1. I‚Äôll see a post on the page asking for a drummer for a gig.

2. I‚Äôll friend request the poster and send an inquiry on Messenger introducing myself and providing links to stuff I‚Äôve played on.

3. They‚Äôll respond and say ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get together and talk/jam.‚Äù  I‚Äôll respond with times I‚Äôm available, and they‚Äôll leave me read and not respond.

I would think for a city like Nashville that people would be a lot better than this, and it‚Äôs starting to get annoying.  I just want to make some great music.

We went to go ask a bartender about getting paid for the show. There was a woman probably in her mid fifties that was staring at Me. I looked at her and nodded. She blew me a couple kisses and did that cat paw thing and made the noise associated with it. I immediately turned my head away.

If ANYONE messages you on your social media about promotion, interviews, radio play, submitting a demo, auditions, etc. Then immediately ask for money. It's a SCAM. No questions asked, it's a scam.

1. Labels don't charge for demo submissions.

2. Radio pays you to play your song, not the other way around.

3. Interviews are invitations not to be paid for unless you're staging one for a press kit or your own promotion.

4. Auditions are also invitations, if you're being asked to pay for a spot it's all bullshit. You could think it's the best thing in the world but everyone could hate it. You're gambling every time you post a song. 

Don't fall for them saying they can guarantee any to you. Music is never a guarantee. It's art, so it's subjective.

I am so sick and tired of seeing people get taken advantage of because they know how badly musicians want to be heard. I have clients ask me every week if a proposal from a fake Instagram is real.

83,What‚Äôs up with all the bitterness and jealousy? ,144,musicians,119,"*I‚Äôve reread this and it‚Äôs definitely obnoxious‚Ä¶.i guess I needed a rant that day. Still all true though. 


I just read the third post this week, where someone that never really even tried is bitter and jealous of anyone having any success. Most don‚Äôt even realize that what they‚Äôre jealous of is some fantasy in their heads that doesn‚Äôt exist to begin with‚Ä¶ Being a full-time musician is not some pie in the sky fantastical dream. If you‚Äôre willing to put in the work, you can do it. Move to Nashville and  play on Broadway 40 hours a week with the occasional weekend run in the van‚Ä¶ it ain‚Äôt glamorous, but that‚Äôs being a full-time musician and you don‚Äôt have to be a virtuoso to do it either.

Many people live in this delusional headspace where they‚Äôre much better than they actually are, and are shocked when they put their music out online and get no traction and have no fans‚Ä¶ Number one, you‚Äôre probably not as good as you think you are and number two, there is so much more to it than simply releasing music. 

I have many talented friends in Nashville that move here, do very little, and then are shocked that the world isn‚Äôt falling at their feet‚Ä¶ The people that I have seen do some things work their butts off 24 seven are fully aware of and actually play the game‚Ä¶ Admittedly that‚Äôs not for everyone but it is what it is.

What‚Äôs the game? From what I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs compromise, persistence, patience, a gimmick and money. I don‚Äôt know what order of importance those go in, but it takes all of them.

Let me guess you‚Äôre an artist and don‚Äôt have a  gimmick? Do you think John Tardy from Obituary uses his speaking voice ü§£? Everything is a gimmick, whether you realize it or not.  

What have you really done? Have you moved away from home? Have you put yourself out there? Ever been on the road? Ever been homeless? Ever played gigs with people you don‚Äôt like and music you don‚Äôt like? Have you played 1000 gigs yet wherever you are? I guarantee had you done any of that you would have a lot to be proud of when you look in the rearview mirror‚Ä¶ So many outcomes are beyond our control, but I bet you wouldn‚Äôt feel bitter and jealous if you had actually put the work in. 

In my opinion, what keeps people up at night is knowing they never really tried not lack of perceived success by the outside world.

Hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as obnoxious, but geez people need to get over themselves a little bit and be proud of themselves for what they‚Äôve done and be happy for others for what they‚Äôve achieved.. Life isn‚Äôt a contest we‚Äôre all just here having experiences, at the end of the day money and recognition means very little. "

91,"my boyfriend just told me my music is commercial, safe and palatable",142,musicians,324,"I'm a 38F, a person that has regretted my whole life not pursuing my passion for music and singing and songwriting while I was young.

I'm white, from a super small, protestant evangelical town.  My family was very loving, and discouraged me from this pursuit out of a genuine fear of poverty-- they had worked so hard to escape it and wanted to ensure I'd never endure it or my children.

I've done a lot, had some professional success-- I mean I worked my ass off to survive as we all do, trying to pay debts and have a decent living space. I did get a management position at a hospital, I created a language services department and created 9 new positions of interpreters-- something the hospital desperately needed.  I was too overwhelmed to continue, had a nervous breakdown...

I never had kids.

My boyfriend called these ladies hags the other day, and inside I died knowing that it'd only take post pregnancy or some 5 more years for him to see me that way.

And I know I'm conflating a lot.  I feel like I have been so busied by so much work, so much fear of the economy, of economic stability, that I didn't live.  And now that I'm making music, the person whose opinion means the most to me in the world says I'm boring, safe, and don't push any limits.

And that's been the case my whole life.  That's why I am where I am.  I think I was always a coward, I must still be, and now my music just reflects that I am.

This must sound like a white woman cry-- because it is and I am and I wish I could disappear.

POST POST POST NOTE: MUSICIANS, this community said loud and clear BE TRUE TO YOURSELF AND LET IT OUT <3"
92,Would you back someone who isn't very good? ,141,musicians,177,"I used to gig with someone and it was getting rough. He wouldn't make setlists and take long pauses between songs deciding what to do. He'd spring new songs on us at the gig, expecting us to follow along. He wouldn't play in time or listen to the rhythm section. 

Even though I enjoyed playing out it was draining and I also worried it would reflect poorly on me. I'm not perfect but I recognize when I mess up and practice. He didn't seem to do this and actually would get annoyed we didn't know the songs he had just come up with. So I stopped playing. 

He's reached out about playing again. Apparently he's had trouble finding backing musicians, so I feel bad. But I am wary of being in more bad shows. 

How would you proceed? Just say no? Try to be clear about expectations (like a setlist)? "
93,Today‚Äôs gig..,138,musicians,22,
94,Today I'm the happiest guitarist alive,139,musicians,32,"I need to get this written out somewhere and you guys will surely understand what's happening.

I played the guitar since being a teenager and I can truly call it a passion. Then bad luck hit hard and I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in my mid-twenties. Since then, playing guitar was impossible because I could not use my left hand and wrist as I would have needed to play. I tried some other instruments (no music has never been an option), but it just never was ""my"" instrument. I play a quite good Blues harmonica now, but still.

Some days ago I bought a 3 string cigar box guitar out of couriosity and IT IS POSSIBLE! I'm sitting here playing my first songs and riffs since 12 damn years and have tears of joy running down my face. 3 strings don't get that fiddly for arthritic fingers and a small neck helps too. What's happening here is finding a possibily to do what you love after you more or less thought it to be impossible and that those days were gone forever.

Sometimes you need to tell the world how you feel. Today I am the happiest guitarist alive, my friends.

97,Do you like my setup? Any suggestions?,136,musicians,55,
98,Be prepared ,133,musicians,70,"Spent the weekend stage-managing a local indie music festival, and I was truly surprised by how many musicians were not prepared, with respect to their gear. An astonishing number of acts featured one or more musicians who found themselves unable to play because a battery or a cord failed, etc.

In most cases, I was able to bridge the gap because I brought extra batteries, cords, picks, strings, etc., for exactly this scenario but there were a few cases that I couldn‚Äôt save. 

So, if you‚Äôve got a gig, please take a moment the night before or the morning of to check your rig, make sure everything works, and maybe think about bringing along supplies and tools you might need in the moment: strings and a winder, picks, batteries, cords, drum key, etc.

And most importantly, don‚Äôt be a dick if your gear fails. Much more often than not, it‚Äôs nobodies fault but yours.

101,"so i found this audio of me and my best friend improving Randy Newman songs and laughing like idiots from feb 2016. He passed away the following month, and i literally miss him every fucking day. I can‚Äôt help but smile listening to it tho. hope this fits here",135,musicians,6,
102,"Talent does matter, personality just matters more.",130,musicians,104,"I've seen so many posts about people complaining that their music is not making it, yet they do 0 PR, Don't invest in a manager, don't build a brand and image. Don't actually engage with fans, ect. One of my biggest lessons was to start taking myself seriously as an artist and stop just dropping on Bandlab and Snapchat with a song I made in a day posting it on my story and calling it good.

I have no tik tok, do not even know what a PR firm is or does, have no marketing plan, no costumes, no videos, no plans to do live performance 

why did I expect to ever blow up? 

From now on i plan to take songs slow 100s of takes if I have to, only make music that actually means something to me emotionally, and actually pay for stems send projects to professionals to get mixed, have a marketing and roll out plan. I hate even making this post instead of just doing it but I feel like it needs to be said and maybe actualizing it into words is good.

sometimes I feel like leaving this reddit because of all the sad people who want to be famous and the lack of actual creative conversation. 

It sounds weird but maybe because you want to blow up, you're making music for it to be received well rather than truly expressing yourself and that hides the uniqueness that you could be bringing to music.

Yeah that rapper kinda sucks and has millions but he also is himself and took his music and art seriously and went and learned the professional route to producing and marketing a record.

Even your favorite great artists or underground artists, they didn't get traction until they got professional help in some shape or form and they invested thousands and thousands into even the earliest records

Get references, and inspiration, plan hard and invest into a more professional route, to the rappers out there, even Kanye has to have his beats go through multiple people and levels of mastering 

Take yourself and the art seriously to the most meticulous level of expression,  produce records that actually mean something deeply to YOU, and Invest into professional help and knowledge to get them out to the world and I guarantee you wouldn't be on Reddit complaining about others making it."
103,My friend keeps telling me there's no money in music,132,musicians,309,"I'm 20 years into a video production career, making a career change and crossing over into audio recording and music production. The cool thing is I can cross over from film, still doing location sound and audio post potentially. I'm doing it the right way, learning Pro Tools, good mixing, good recital crew skills (miking and hooking up DANTE etc.) Learning how to sight read for guitar, eventually bass, so that I can also possibly gig or be a studio musician (not trying to become a rock star or anything). But, I do make my own music and will most likely eventually get a band together and do the DIY music thing like make records and merchandise and play local shows or whatnot. I used to play in a couple of bands in my 20's but it was nothing serious.

My buddy used to be in a couple of bands, but they never went anywhere or got big. One of the bands I thought was pretty good. He keeps telling me that there's no money in music, even for production people and that me starting out at 43 is late and that I should stick with video. He's saying that even roadies with big touring bands that run the house mix or set up audio or the A2's don't make diddly squat, and being just a supporting musician for a big star or big act, or decent act for that matter pays next to nothing. Not to mention streaming doesn't pay anything.

Am I wasting my time on this music thing? I just love music, I think it's great and I wanna be around it and make a living. I'm over doing video, there's nothing that cool for me anymore in it. Music is cool and fun to me.

104,Had my first gig the other night,132,musicians,33,"And it went so damn well! It‚Äôs just me and my mate in the band and  we got there nice and early before the other bands (we were first on the list) but just thought it was a good idea to be punctual. I went up and introduced myself to the sound guy and we chatted for a while and then I offered him a beer, he declined but was glad I offered. Went to the bar  talked the the man behind the bar turns out he was the owner opened this place coz he just loves live music and then he gave me a free beer! 

Quick sound check and then we were up there doing the thing jumping round like mad, I was quite nervous coz I‚Äôm not a gigger, but I thought to myself fuck it man I wanna look back at this when I‚Äôm older and think yeah I really did that. Everyone was dancing and hooting and hollering and then I stepped on my lead and pulled it out of the amp during the song and guess what, no one noticed hell I even forgot about it till this morning coz my mate reminded me and we laughed. 

Anyways we walk off stage and the venue was like a long hallway so we have to walk down the other end to pack our shit up. As we were walking past and everyone was like that was amazing you guys are great and hi fiving us asking for our socials (we don‚Äôt have any still :S) all complete strangers giving compliments. The sound dude came up to me and said that was so entertaining you guys killed it up there! I work here three days a week and we hardly get anything as good as that. Which blew me away. Me and my mate step outside coz we were boiling and the owner comes out and shakes our hands saying that was really impressive. I said I bet you say that to all the bands and he assured us he didn‚Äôt and says especially if they are out here coz he shouldn‚Äôt leave the bar unattended. 

So yeah that‚Äôs my story and I‚Äôm still on a high coz of it! Just wanted to share and if you‚Äôve made it this far thanks for reading! :)"

110,How do I tell my band members we should put value to our music and charge for shows,127,musicians,158,"
I‚Äôm a drummer in an indie/emo/altertnative ish band. We‚Äôve been putting on quite a few free shows at one of our band members houses. We haven‚Äôt done many shows where we charge. One of the reasons is they don‚Äôt want to charge their friends. I think we should put value to what we do and our real friends will support us by paying $2. You can‚Äôt even get a meal at McDonald‚Äôs for $2. A lot of our shows where we have had people have to pay to see us, there‚Äôs been a big chunk of their friends who ask if they could get sneaked in, and the band members have complied. I really disagree with this. What can I say to convince them without sounding like a dad? I‚Äôm older than all of them by about 6-7 years "

112,Going from a national touring act back to a local band is difficult,125,musicians,227,My touring career ended a decade ago. Some friends and I started a studio project over Covid and we decided to play shows. I haven‚Äôt been the local/support band since years before being large enough for big tours and my ego is getting away. I felt like a fraud opening for someone and no one there to see us play. I know I have an ego problem because of it and feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be this low on the totem pole. It‚Äôs tough going from national tours to playing no one. Anyone else relate to this?

116,Have I found my musical soulmate? Is there such a thing?,124,musicians,44,"The John Lennon to my Paul McCartney?

I was driving past a skate park a few years ago when I noticed a dude with fantasticly curly hair ripping it on the bass with a band. I got quite a few blocks away when I had a thought ‚Äòif I don‚Äôt turn around I‚Äôm gonna regret it.‚Äô So I turned around and watched the gig. I wanted to talk to the lead singer after the show and I was shitting bricks nervous. While waiting in line to talk to him I turned over to the curly haired bass guy and made conversation with him since he was standing there quietly. And shockingly I wasn‚Äôt nervous, I was able to represent myself authentically and relaxed because talking to him was a relief compared to the big scary lead singer. 

Never ended up talking with the lead singer much but I did get the bassist‚Äôs socials and Spotify. And holy shit I was floored- he only had 9 monthly listeners (for his solo work) but something about his music resonated with every atom of my being. At the time I discovered his music I was in a major mental health crisis and all of my creative abilities were 6 feet underground. I also had no grasp of my creative voice. His music helped bust the coffin door off. I was upset he lived 14 hours away because I felt like I needed to know him. 

Fast forward a couple years to now and I still admire his work so much. I asked him to be a producer on my record and he gave me an enthusiastic yes!! 

So far it‚Äôs been unreal. I feel like I can speak so plainly to him and I don‚Äôt have to translate or filter myself. I feel like I can be my authentic weird self and have strange ideas and he‚Äôll embrace them. He‚Äôs sent me back some of my stuff after he worked on it and I‚Äôve genuinely gotten teary eyed. He‚Äôs had a hand in bringing me so close to my creative voice and the stuff he‚Äôs done with my work is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for!! It‚Äôs cool seeing my music come to life and I trust him with my precious musical babies. He also told me that he finds that our voices work really well together. 

I‚Äôve been curious if there‚Äôs such a thing as people you are destined to collab with? Or people who were supposed to make music together? Maybe I‚Äôm off my rocker, but it just seems so whacky that he happened to be in town that day so many years back when I was driving by and I had that feeling that I needed to turn around or I would regret it. And so whacky that this collab is going so freaking well already."

around 400 songs from us and Europe, including snoop dogg, Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber, Michael Jackson, and basically any name that is famous.

The rest is basically piano pieces, jazz standards, home recordings, and archive recordings (the oldest from around 1920, I even transcribed an old jingle for the elections of 1930 or 1940)

I also transcribed at least 30 korean songs, including some game soundtracks.

Oh, and I also transcribed 2 Chinese songs and one Taiwanese."
120,15 years of music marketing taught me this:,121,musicians,58,"Every campaign, artist, and goal is unique. Therefore, every marketing strategy should reflect that simple fact. That's why most music marketing services out there are empty carbs. 

They aren't unique or customized. They're too often generic and sketchy systems that don't build what an artist needs most...a fan base that engages with the artist's work and wants to explore more of it.

That's because these bs systems don't focus on relationship building between fan and artist. They focus on inflated stream numbers and follows that don't translate to long-term engagement.

It takes time to build strong and deep relationships with people and the same is true for loyal music fans. 

Anyone selling a strategy that gets fans or streams fast or only costs a few hundred dollars is probably cutting corners and not worth an artist's time/money.

Their sketchy system or ""proprietary audience"" is also going to hurt an artist‚Äôs algorithmic scores on social media and digital streaming platforms. Their AI algorithms know the difference between legit fan engagement and inflation tactics.

I see a ton of artists wasting their shoestring budgets on ‚Äúplug and chug‚Äù methods like ""follow for follow"" and ""stream for stream"" schemes, third-party playlist placements, and simple ads/boosts.

They're too generic to work and likely to do more harm than good.

Artists don‚Äôt need a simple hack or ‚Äúget streams/followers quick‚Äù scheme. They need a real long term strategy and the system that both grows and and nurtures their existing audience.

Quality marketing is customized, consistent, and moves specific listeners in a unique, meaningful way, so they become excited fans.

Commercial success is achieved from building relationships with fans and industry professionals over time‚Äîusing many pieces/forms of content. 

An artist must build a rapport with a listener before the listener actually cares enough to become a fan or the connection that unlocks an artists career.

This is precisely why quality is always more important than quantity. Artists, agents, and managers have to think less about scale and more about deepening connection.

- Unfortunately, social media isn‚Äôt very generous with organic reach, even to people already following. So artists need to learn how to use paid ads to retarget people engaging to get seen.

- Playlists are nice when they‚Äôre reputable, but it's often hard to get on the good ones. While they might increase streams, they have very low fan conversion rates.

- PR isn‚Äôt relevant for indies the way it was 10 years ago. It‚Äôs really expensive and hardly ever worth the time and cost anymore. Most fans discover new indie music on social media and streaming platforms, not blogs and magazines.

- Online courses are most often teaching an oversimplified hack that doesn‚Äôt work for most artists. Some can be useful, but it can be hard to decipher.

- Touring is a ton of work and energy, but a great way to connect with listeners and sell merch. Performing cities a few times a year can go a long way with deepening relationships and artists success.

- By far the most beneficial and cost effective way to market music is with solid content, targeted conversion ads, and a keen eye for data analytics.

Live performance, frequent organic posts to socials, and an effective ads system can go a long way.

The average artist isn‚Äôt going to be able to hop on a stage and wow an audience after taking an online course and the same goes for marketing their music.

An effective music marketing campaign is as sophisticated as any piece of well produced music. So thinking an artists can ‚Äúpick it up‚Äù quickly is compete bs.

For artists looking to work with an ads expert, BEWARE of services that don't include a 1-on-1 consultation with a person and run ads on their own Meta or Google ad account, rather than the artist‚Äôs.

Far too often, ad managers or agencies that don‚Äôt set up the ads on the artist's account are intentionally harvesting the artist‚Äôs ads data for their own gain, concealing sketchy practices, and overcharging because the artist doesn‚Äôt know better. 

Owning your own data and demanding transparency is paramount. It‚Äôs your business and they‚Äôre contractors. Keep your own data in-house.

At the end of the day, difference between commercially successful artists and everyone else almost always comes down to their branding, marketing, and how they interact with existing fans.

Most of the 4 main ways to make money as an indie artist require engaged fans, not casual streamers:
- live concert
- merch
- crowdfunding
- sync

For the past 15 years, I've been a professional musician, artist manager, and music biz consultant.

121,Being in a band is hardly worth the stress. Should I take break from music?,120,musicians,229,"My last band broke up recently. I‚Äôve always loved music. I‚Äôm just sick of all the BS that comes along with being in a band. It seems like being in a band is 95 percent BS like all of the band members disagreeing about the set list, trying to get everyone‚Äôs schedules lined up, band members who aren‚Äôt committed, and a constant clashing of egos. I don‚Äôt really sing, so that takes most solo gigs off the table. I would like to keep making music, but after this last band I feel like I need a break from dealing with band mates, venues etc. I used to look forward to making music and now it seems like a chore. Should I just focus on other things for now?  I like the idea of being part of a group, but my life is more peaceful when I‚Äôm not. "

123,Am I too old and shitty to start a band?,121,musicians,94,"I'm 51. I've loved music as long as I can remember. Tried for years to play guitar but never got good. Always wanted to sing but didn't have the courage. Now I'm old and have stopped worrying what other people think and I'm getting pretty decent at playing piano while singing things in my limited range. Plus I live in Warsaw, Poland, where people who can sing in English are a pretty valuable resource. 

I want to join a band. Just jamming, playing covers, having fun. Am I crazy? I feel like I should have just gotten this over with at age 14 and played Ramones covers, but better late than never. 

Any advice on how to do it? Thanks y'all."
124,What's the best way to say to a  musician that they messed up and did not practice for the gig?,119,musicians,200,"Just want to know people's thoughts? I'm an a few bands and run my own aswell. This does not happen a lot but whenever I come across a player that came unprepared the normal thing I do is to ask someone else next time to take there place. 

I used to give these players some slack and hoping they play better next time but almost always they mess up. So now I'm a lot less patient, especially if the gigs I get are paid well. 

These actions have gotten me in a bit of bother. A great guitarist and good friend of mine was this kind of player who didn't practice. I passed the next gig off to another guitarist and he was really upset with me, saying that ""as a band leader, I would have appreciated a lot more direction from you and we would not have had this problem"". 

Btw, all my music has recordings, demos and charts written out. 

I find it really hard to confront people about there playing, that's why I have stuck to my normal method. But now I'm open to more solutions.

This is gonna come off incredibly boomer-esque, and for that I truly apologise. If it‚Äôs any consolation:

1) I‚Äôm 27, I‚Äôm not ‚Äúkids-these-days‚Äùing

2) In my experience older musicians exemplify this problem even more so, in general - obviously, nothing is black and white.

3) I‚Äôm levying this criticism at myself, too.

**Anyway,** I‚Äôve been in many scenes in my time, I have attended and gigged all the gigs, and something I‚Äôve noticed is that very little of the rock/blues I‚Äôve heard *or played* has scratched the rock/blues itch I‚Äôm aiming at. This is maybe especially true of house bands at jam nights. 

The issue isn‚Äôt really musical, it‚Äôs vibes. So much of the rock/blues scene is so *sterilised*. It‚Äôs safe. It should not be safe, the heart of this music is *the opposite of safe*. I don‚Äôt care how good you are at guitar, I don‚Äôt care how flashy your fills are, I don‚Äôt even care how good a voice you have. I want to walk into a disgusting basement club and have your kick drum punch me in the throat. I want grit, I want sex appeal, I want gross, unwashed bohemians screaming because they‚Äôve been singing for eight hours and their voice has given out. I want to see sweat running down the walls of a room that could safely hold 20 but somehow has a hundred waiting at the bar.

Give me the hamburg Beatles, give me the early Stones, give me the Sex Pistols, give me pre-fame Nirvana. Walk up on stage like you own the place and scream a song you wrote yesterday about how you want to overthrow the government or screw your neighbour‚Äôs mom. Just please hit your guitar like you want the strings to break. No more classics, no more 48 bar solos, play like it‚Äôs 1959 and you‚Äôre on an ungodly amount of speed.

136,How many instruments do you play?,113,musicians,461,"Hey. I‚Äôm a rock musician.

I‚Äôve played in a bunch of bands. I‚Äôm most often the guitarist, but I‚Äôve also been the bassist, drummer and vocalist.

A lot of people (pretty much only non-musicians) think it‚Äôs surprising I play more than one instrument.
Like, the first instrument I told my coworker I played was bass, and she always assume I play bass in my band when I‚Äôve told her multiple times I‚Äôm the guitarist in my band.

I‚Äôve been in my city‚Äôs music scene for most of a decade, and easily the majority of musicians I know play more than one instrument and like myself have played different instruments in different bands.

It seems like a lot of people have this idea that a person dedicates themself to one instrument for life.

The only musicians I know that only play one instrument are either drummers, or they‚Äôre like a classical or jazz musician with formal education/training.

So, how many instruments do YOU play, Redditer?"
137,How can I be a rockstar without actually doing anything?

I really think I can be a rockstar, I‚Äôm just wondering; what instrument should I learn that‚Äôs so simple that I won‚Äôt actually have to do any work? To be clear, I want the results, with none of the work. I am unwilling to do any research of my own, or give any indication of my interests; but I do expect a chatroom of strangers to give me the secret musical code that‚Äôll give me full ability of the instrument of my choosing. Basically a ‚Äúget pro quick scheme‚Äù, if you will. It seems to me that the people who have been pursuing a single instrument their whole lives are suckers. Like if you‚Äôve played for so long, how are you not famous? Anyways would some input from you nerds. Also my gear budget is $50 so I figure I could get a nice instrument.

139,I feel like it will never be good enough ,115,musicians,113,"After studying music for many years and graduating my music bachelor, I find myself wishing I‚Äôd done something else. 

I see my peers go viral, get playlisted, get radio play and playing gigs every week. I constantly stalk their numbers and see how mine are barely existent.

I truly believe my art and music is good enough, but I lack the willpower and nerve to put myself out there enough. I have tried my best to network but due to not being a conventionally attractive girl in the industry I struggle immensely to connect on a authentic level as they are superficial. 

This is no excuse but I am very alone in the world as I only have my brother and friends (my family isn‚Äôt in my life). I have never had a stable place to call home and I long for a peace and love I lack right now feeling like a failure next to my amazing peers. I don‚Äôt know if I should keep going or accept that I don‚Äôt want to give more of myself as it‚Äôs making me unhappy as of now.

EDIT:
Thank you for all the lovely replies. This morning I started missing the fun of writing songs and remembered why I even started doing music to begin with. All the different opinions and stories you have commented reminded me that being born with a creative drive is something beautiful, and regardless the outcome it‚Äôs a talent we should celebrate wether it‚Äôs alone in the rehearsal room or in front of a big crowd. I finally sat down and made a new playlist (it‚Äôs been 1 year since my last) and suddently I feel a little more alive again. I had forgotten how amazing it feels to discover new music‚Ä¶

In two weeks I have my final exam concert, a 40 min set with all my original work. I worked so hard and made a team of my band, strings, sax, dancers and a choir. I‚Äôll cherish the performance and be proud of doing what I always longed for.ü•π"
140,Performed at my first Open Mic night tonight.,113,musicians,32,"I've been playing music for 25 years, since I was 5 years old. I've been writing and producing music for about 10+ years, but stage performance has always petrified me. It was fine to be able to record and tweak everything ""to perfection"", but I've always just been crippled with nerves and haven't ever performed publicly, beyond my family.

I turned 30 this year, and whatever possessed me, I sucked it up and I sang/played one of my original songs at an open mic in my city.

I know full well if I saw a recording of my performance I'd be mortified, but I'm still feeling kinda high from it. Thankfully everyone there was super nice anyway, and I already can't wait to practice for the next one.

I also didn't tell any of my friends or family I was doing it, so I was there totally solo. They'd have been supportive and I'm lucky to have them, but honestly it just felt like a thing I needed to do on my own.



Sorry for gushing, but.. since I hadn't told anyone I know, and I plan on doing at least a few more solo, I gotta unload here!

  
EDIT: Thanks to you all for your kind words! I've been singing all day since and have a sore throat now, so I gotta watch myself if I'm going to perform next week üòÇ"

151,Wear earplugs.,107,musicians,64,"In rehearsal and playing live, be sure to protect your hearing. Long term hearing damage is a real thing, that you won't notice for years until it's too late.  

Rock bands and live music people - please continue to work on phasing out floor monitors and switching over to IEMs.  - especially for rehearsals.  

Venues/promotors - provide ear plugs to anyone who needs them when booking loud bands.  

We all love live music. Let's enjoy it as long as we can!

Guitar players / singers who don't like using ear plugs because you can't hear yourself - you need to get over it and buy yourself IEMs.  It's not worth losing your hearing just so you can personally hear your own tone.  The house never hears what you hear on stage anyway.  Learn to catch a vibe without making others uncomfortable.  

I honestly don't understand why singers don't exclusively use IEMs.  You can hear yourself way better than in a monitor and never have to stress your voice ( unless you want to creativity).  Stop relying on venues to provide you with loud monitors."
152,"For original bands, I think shorter sets are almost always better than longer ones",106,musicians,113,"Think about it this way - you're a band no one in the audience has heard of before. Would you rather they leave your show wanting more, or leave your show feeling glad that your set is finally over?

I've definitely noticed this myself seeing bands that play longer sets - if I don't really like them, it's painful to sit though a long set. If I do like them at first, if they drag the set on they tend to lose me towards the end. It's only if I really really like them will I enjoy the longer set, and that's like 5% of bands. Not saying that 95% of bands suck, they just don't align with my tastes that I want to listen to their music for 45+ minutes straight. And that's gonna be true of most people.

something like a 30 minute set is a lot better IMO. First of all, you can pick your best songs and so there's a better chance more people will like you to begin with. You have more wiggle room to pick songs that would fit the vibe of the venue / crowd. If people still don't like you, they don't have to sit through that long of a set and they're not going to associate you with a negative memory. If they do like you, you're gonna leave them wanting more, and they're more likely to look you up after the show to hear more. 

Now, I'm not saying that you should play for 20 minutes if you're getting paid for 60. But you really should err on the side of less is more."

170,Does Your Music Suck?,96,musicians,155," 

For the past three years I‚Äôve been running a podcast interview project focused on underground/undiscovered/or otherwise unknown musicians.  
 I began this project because I wanted to give something back to music after decades of my own personal relationship with music. I found that most mainstream podcast/music shows focus on big name artists or industry recognizable names. I wanted to go the other direction, to find people recording in their bedrooms, or people playing instruments on the street, or just people who learned to play an instrument for the love of music.

Over the past three years I‚Äôve conducted over 200 interviews with people all over the country and world at various levels in their career and with various levels of participation in music. It's been a truly humbling experience and infinitely motivational.

What I‚Äôve learned from everyone I‚Äôve interviewed is that although we all have our own passionate relationship with music, everyone has a unique perspective on what that means to them and how they‚Äôve allowed it to interact with their lives. Some people have casual participation that allows them to express themselves, and that is their concept of being successful. While others are driven to reach into the stars and have a definition of success that puts the bar so high they may never reach it, just to keep themselves motivated to keep going.

Although everyone has their own relationship with how they define success, there is a consistent message that resonates across these interviews. You are never too old, too young, too inexperienced, too incapable, or too ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù to begin learning an instrument or making music. All you need is motivation.

As with anything subjective, sometimes you won‚Äôt like what you make, sometimes others won‚Äôt like what you make, but the consensus is the same. If you want to do it, you should, and do it unapologetically, you should feel empowered to explore your own creativity to the very depths of what that means to you. That may seem like an obvious trope to some, but some people need to hear that, and need to be told it's ok to make music that only they like. Not all music is made with the intention of being a commercial success. In fact most music is made out of catharsis as a form of therapeutic release. It is all valid, and it is all ‚Äúmusic‚Äù.

This project has truly been amazing! To speak to so many talented musicians, and hear how music has impacted their lives has been an honor they all trusted me with.  I‚Äôm not very good at social media postings or podcast marketing, but I wish I were so I could get more traffic to these people that have taken the time to participate in this project.   
 I‚Äôm not adding any links to this post because I don‚Äôt want it to be viewed as self-promotion and get flagged. So, if you want to listen to these interviews, you can find them pretty much everywhere. There are links on my profile to Youtube and Spotify. I also post them to r/ManifestBrutality  
 With that being said. I intend to continue these interviews with musicians who wish to share their stories and experiences across the world. It really has been an amazing journey since I started. My goal is to be able to work on this project full-time, and I‚Äôm hoping to make that a reality.   
 If you have any questions about this, or anything else. I‚Äôm happy to have a discussion.  
 In closing, keep making music, keep exploring what music means to you.   
 Don‚Äôt give up, don‚Äôt let anyone tell you you‚Äôre not good enough or to stop.

184,Important Advice for Musicians,91,musicians,33,"If you're looking into the new year and thinking *""I would like more gigs""* or *""I need to maintain the number of gigs that I get""* obviously practising your musicianship and perfecting your ability on your instrument or voice is critical*.* Still, I'm going to pass on some key advice that requires no practice at all. 

If you ever feel like you want to criticise or bitch about another musician who is playing in the same scene as you just tell yourself to **SHUT UP**. If you want to get booked, **NEVER** be that guy that constantly has to have something to say about other players. 

&#x200B;

**Main Reasons Why**

&#x200B;

1. **If you choose to bitch about someone it's always going to get back to you.** The music world is very small so even in a large city, your comments will always come back to bite you. I have come across players losing out on great opportunities just cause they decided to be music critics after challenging gigs. The scary thing is, no-one will tell you why your phone isn't ringing as they are not going to confront you. People will just start deleting your number when you bitch about their close friends. Even amazing musicians at the top of their craft lose work just because they come across as judgmental arseholes. Gigs are so challenging when you play with someone who is judgmental, you won't believe the effort that people go through to avoid working with certain individuals. 
2. **No good musician actually wants to hear your opinion.** If you try to strike up a conversation with a good musician about how a guitarist soloing is ""too samey"" or that the drummer on a gig is ""not tight enough"" you need to remember t*hat they honestly don't care and would rather not hear what you want to say*. All of the great musicians that I have worked with practice modesty and they are extremely humble about their craft. They know that you will always be learning as a musician and any attempt at learning should be supported and encouraged. The only appropriate setting where you would criticise a fellow musician is in a lesson or masterclass, but it's constructive criticism. When you give your opinion right after a performance you just sound very stupid. 
3. **It's a major red flag that you are insecure.** When you observe a musician laying down weird ""hot takes"" about the performers after a gig it's almost always coming from a place of insecurity. All they're doing is comparing themself to the performers on stage and they are jealous that they can't perform to the same level or thinking *""I'm better than all of those musicians on stage and that gives me some fulfilment.""* These guys have their own issues to deal with and you wouldn't want to work with them if you had the choice. ALSO, going to gigs should be an inspiring experience. Your musical training should enable you to appreciate live performances more than a non-musician. Like an artist going into a gallery and being inspired by each painting, you should be embracing live music without judgment. 
4. **Eventually, your inner critic will make you hate** ***your own musical practice.*** I've sadly witnessed this too often. Musicians that tend to bitch and criticise others burn out faster as their inner voice becomes too critical of their own performance practice. Daily Practice becomes harder when you are constantly battling with an inner dialogue that you apply to people that you don't respect. If you don't approach listening to others with compassion, mindfulness and appreciation then how are *you* going to *PLAY* in a way where you can inspire that in your own music? If all you think of are ways to shame musicians then you're going to constantly shame yourself when you perform. That's never fun. 

&#x200B;

This post comes as a reflection after having this conversation with many very talented and wholesome musicians, they all preach the same thing. Don't be stupid and negative toward other musicians. Support your fellow musicians and encourage them to reach their potential, this career is fucking hard enough. People will flock to work with you when you approach any interaction or gig with compassion and kindness. If you feel triggered by this post and carry on to do the opposite... good luck."

193,I have a theory that being a great musician is reliant on being interested in other things.,88,musicians,85,"
I‚Äôve been thinking about this for a while. Almost every guitarist and musician that I really like is also focused heavily on something else. Music might be their number one thing, but they also do a lot of other things. Maybe they have an interest in another type of art like painting or acting, or maybe they love history or sports, and they seem just as comfortable doing those things as they do with music. Even if music is their number one thing, then it‚Äôs still possible that it takes up the greatest percentage of their mental bandwidth but still uses up less than the combination of everything else. For example, 40% music, then 30% history and 30% exercise. I feel like I rarely see interviews with musicians I love where they talk about music like it‚Äôs literally their whole personality.

I think this rings true for a couple of reasons. One, it‚Äôs good to take breaks. Doing so often makes you come back with a clearer head and stronger motivation than obsession ever could. Two, I believe that in order to output art, you need input. If your only input is other art, then you‚Äôre going to make a lot of derivative art. Art is always derivative in some way, but it‚Äôs always more authentic sounding to me when I can hear the personal interests in the music either lyrically or some other way, like progressions that sound inspired by something outside of just what the artist usually listens to. I know there are more reasons that this makes sense to me but I can‚Äôt think of them right now. Probably need to take a break.

The point being, it may seem like making music your whole thing is a good way to excel, but I‚Äôd argue that it will end up limiting your ability and creativity.

To those of you this seems obvious to, that‚Äôs good! To those of you who disagree, I‚Äôm happy to discuss this further. What are your thoughts?"
194,help me convince my bandmates to record in a studio,87,musicians,166,My uncle is a musician and works with a grammy nominated producer‚Ä¶ we got an option to record a 4-5 song ep with him for 1000$ and i was ecstatic. I told them i‚Äôd pay for as much as i can but they should all help me too. They think it would be better to just buy some equipment and record it ourselves but the thing is i dont think it would sound good. I feel like it would be almost as expensive if we did it ourselves just to sound worse? Are they right or how should I convince them?

210,"One member of the band is so bad that he's dragging everyone down, but he's also a good friend. How Can I handle this ?",86,musicians,158,"Hi there,

A bit of context: I joined a blues rock band over a year ago as a singer. It's a group of four friends from the same village, all in their forties, and I'm the newcomer, the youngest, the girl... 
I got back into music after a long break and I really clicked with the atmosphere. We don't have any ambitions other than having fun. At first, I was finding my groove, no problem, but the more we progress, the more I feel limited.

Well, they're not great musicians, they know it, but I don't hold it against them; playing for fun is also good, and I have another more serious project on the side. I won't dwell on all the problems, because ultimately, they'd probably all be solved if we had a decent drummer.

But our drummer is a nightmare. Can't keep the beat, gets lost in the songs, and is very (very) limited technically. It's awful. I've put in a lot of effort to help him improve, but everything I try fails.

I know that without him, everything would be better, and in fact, I took advantage of a day when he wasn't there to suggest to the others to play along with a drum machine. They played better than ever and they noticed it. 
But here's the thing: as bad as our drummer may be, he's also a good guy. And especially, he's the mega buddy of the two guitarists. So, I don't come out as a winner if there's ever an open ""conflict"" except that...

...They've also all noticed that I push them to do better. Let's say that my outsider perspective encourages them to challenge themselves more than they did before, just among friends... And I can see that they feel inspired to try more complicated things. They would definitely be capable of it with another drummer, once again.

So, the question is:
How do I convince them to say goodbye to the drummer?
Or from your experiences, is it a lost cause, and should I leave the ship or keep my mouth shut? (Which would be ironic for a singer...).

211,Had a rough gig tonight.,84,musicians,139,"It was a busy weekend in our town, yet no one really showed up to our gig at a popular bar. We had like 6 to 10 people all night. The lack of people and interest made it do the band didn't gel at all. We were so clunky. 

So awkward.

I would rather pay in front of a rowdy, shitty crowd of drunks than an empty bar where every song is met with crickets after we finish. 

Sometimes it makes me feel like I'm chasing after something I'll never get.

How do you guys deal with rough gigs?

Edit: thanks so much for all of your thoughtful comments. I was feeling depressed after the show last night and I guess I needed to be reminded that its not the end of the world when you have a bad gig. We've been playing as a band for 10 years and I gave up on ""making it"" long ago. I was just frustrated, because we play mostly originals and it always seems to be the cover bands playing the same two dozen classic rock songs that get the big turnout. We're good at what we do and I feel sometimes we deserve more of a reception, but I need to stop feeling entitled and just enjoy the music we play. 

Thanks again for sharing your stories."

IDEAS TO REVIEW: mode scales, "
230,What 20 years of playing in venues has taught me:,77,musicians,53,"Gigs are fun, yes they can be stressful at times but knowing what to do and what to expect always helps. It's all about being prepared and leaving a lasting impression.

Over the last 20 years I've been played in countless venues and over that time I've learnt what makes me feel at ease,   
 what's help me become more professional and importantly what's helped me secure more gigs.

**So on that note, here's my top 10 of unwritten rules that only experience has taught me.**

&#x200B;

1. Remember you're working and representing the venue you‚Äôre playing at. It‚Äôs important to act professionally and create a friendly atmosphere within the venue. Stay focused and keep safety in mind at all times.
2.  Although things can sometimes go wrong (it‚Äôs not always in our control), it‚Äôs always important to not show stress. Even if you‚Äôre not feeling that confident or perhaps you‚Äôre feeling a bit nervous, try and maintain an enthusiastic and positive attitude at all times.
3. Be considerate and humble. You‚Äôve been chosen to play at somebody's venue. Appreciate the opportunity and always treat the staff and customers with respect. This won‚Äôt go unnoticed and leads to getting rebooked. Leave your ego at home!
4. Further to point 3. Remember that you were booked to play, **not** your friends. Equipment is expensive and venue owners can get nervous with others around ‚Äòtheir‚Äô expensive equipment. It‚Äôs great to bring friends along to support you but they also reflect on you and the venue if seen as being part of the entourage! Respect the venue's rules.
5. Be prepared! Organisation is key to being professional. Check what equipment you need to bring before you arrive. Does the venue already have equipment? Do you need your own microphone? What time can you arrive to set up? What is the fee being paid or that you‚Äôre requesting for your services? These are all key questions to ask BEFORE the gig, not during the night.
6. Check the timings. What time will you need to start playing? How long will you need to perform a sound check? What time will you need to finish playing? If playing with others then check the set times and that you have adequate time to move, unplug, set up your things.
7. Being open minded and humble. It‚Äôs always good to learn more skills, if you‚Äôre playing with others then embrace the different styles and approaches others have. You may learn something new or even pass on some tips to other people.
8. Be helpful and proactive. Should you bring other supplies? Can you assist fellow musicians and the venue beyond the ‚Äònormal‚Äô responsibilities? Sharing social media posts, handing out flyers, leaving reviews after your gig to help promote the venues. The more helpful you can be, the more respected and popular you will be with the venues and others.
9. A big one! Handle requests from customers/staff diplomatically. Always be polite, let people down gently if you‚Äôre unable to play their request. Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm really sorry , I don‚Äôt have that‚Äô or 'we're unable to do that one I'm afraid' rather than ‚ÄòThat song‚Äôs terrible‚Äô or ‚ÄòYeah, I‚Äôll play it later‚Äô and then never playing it. Customers are there to have a good time and not to be insulted.
10. Not every gig will go as imagined, things can and will go wrong. Remember it‚Äôs always best to address any issues/problems at the end of the night with the relevant person. Don‚Äôt moan to the venue staff or cleaner. Take the concern to the management or booking manager directly. This helps maintain professionalism.

So I hope this has helped and it would be great to hear your thoughts and perhaps any other tips you have which have helped you in the past.

231,I want to be a professional musician but fear I am too old.,78,musicians,150,"Hello all. My first post on this subreddit. 

I have practiced guitar for 10 or 15 years. I consider myself myself intermediate.

I practiced scales and a few songs and have written one. That got me interested in recording.

I am 33 and live with my father and work part time as a delivery driver. I have a few bills to pay and take care of a lot of cats. 

I took the risk and bought a laptop and basic recording equipment (headphones, microphone, and interphase) which I owe on credit. 

I don't know what my prospects are. I think I could join a band but I'm going through a stage in my life where I'm becoming aware of my limitations. It sounds embarrassing, but I like a lot of my dreams are impractical. I'm just doing this to do it then.

That's me. Any advice would help.

232,Why don't we listen to original music?,77,musicians,137,"I've noticed this here and also on other social media sites. People post their own music, and it's always 0 comments.  I would never post my own music on a place like this for that reason - and I also will admit that I don't often listen to the music of others.  

My own reasons are probably partly because in the past, when I have listened, I've often been disappointed.  But probably I'm missing some really good new music by carrying that bias.  

What is the reason you don't listen to other people's homegrown recordings?  "
233,Never meet your heroes,78,musicians,91,"My experience with a band I looked up to.

I'm a death metal drummer first and foremost, been playing for a long time and started honing my skills in the last 4 or 5 years. My band I've been playing drums in has slowed down immensely so I've been looking for a new band to jam with/perform in. 

There's this one band local-ish to my area. Not a huge by any means but they do have a significant following. Signed to a major metal label, put out two records on said label, did some touring in the United States and played some underground festivals in Europe. Their guitar player put out on Instagram that he was looking for bassists, drummers, and lead guitarists that would want to perform some shows in the band.

Now this band I've looked up to a bit, especially from a drumming standpoint, but also from a guitar playing standpoint as well with their intricate rhythms, mind bending melodies, and fretless bass. Their original drummer is still currently a big influence on me currently, but he went on to play in other, much bigger death metal bands that I'd also consider to be huge influences on my drumming.

Anyway, I sent a message saying I was interested in playing drums, looking for a band to get more serious with. I wasn't expecting a response honestly at all but then he did, saying some really weird shit.

First message he sent was ""Hey I just listened to your bandcamp, you are absolutely unskilled, what made you think you'd ever join -name of band-, is this a joke lol.""

I'm like what?? I know I'm not the greatest drummer of all time but this response was way too outta pocket and we ended up getting into an argument that lasted roughly an hour and a half. He kept saying weird shit. 

He asked me if I wanted to make a bet, if I could learn one of their new songs in a week and play it flawlessly I front of him id get a CD copy of their new album. I was tempted on doing it not even for the CD, but to just flat out prove him wrong.

He even made a very vague threat that read like this.

""I don't have time for this, I'm from the hood.""

Like what does this even mean lol.

After all this, he eventually just said that he already had a drummer anyway. When I asked him why didn't he just say that in the first place instead of starting an argument, he just said, ""I wanted to have some fun, who said bands always had to be serious?"" 

That was basically the end of that conversation. 

Seriously what the fuck just happened lol. I was never rude to him at all, just responded to his Instagram post and met with immediate hostility. I don't think I've ever actually experienced anything like this before. Hell, no response would have been better. 

Never meet your heroes. Shit, just don't react to them on social media."

We never got really ""big""/made it a full time job but practiced, and gigged, regulary. Cut a handful of EPs, but always had troubling getting everykne to focus on doing a full album (plus money, we were all broke in our 20s haha).

Except for a few months way back at the end of HS, I have been in at least one band since I was 16 (30 now). Nearly half my life, and the entirety of my adult life.

Some years ago I took on mixing and audio engineering pretty seriously, out of necessity at first, and out of love for it after a bit. I keep a small but steady flow of work in that field so it's not like being without a band removes me from working with others in music. Though it's obviously way more removed feeling.

Feels almost the same as breaking off a long term relationship. There is a sense of freedom that is neat, but more consuming is this weird lost & empty feeling.

There's no point im getting at I suppose, I just have. Had trouble talking about it with anyone as around me. Thanks to anyone who took time to read. Keep on jaming"
242,Why do music schools still push going for orchestra jobs,78,musicians,93,"I (23F) have been studying music for the past five years. I'm just always taken aback how so many music schools and professors keep pushing the agenda that the only two music career options are an education job or an orchestra job, which is far from the truth, especially in 2023.

Music schools additionally keep pushing the stigma to train day and night for orchestra jobs that rarely have opportunities and openings. It is arguably the most promoted career option in music school, yet one of the worst paid positions with little to no job market.

Only 50 orchestras in the US are full-time, only 20 of those orchestras pay an annual salary of 50k or more, and the AVERAGE age to land any kind of orchestra job is 38.

To do this math, let's just say there's 3 oboe positions in an orchestra. So, that would be 60 oboe positions in the country offering an annual salary of 50k+. 1,795 institutions in the United States have degree-granting music programs. Let's just say one oboe player graduates from these colleges each year.

If someone gets an orchestra job at 38 and keeps it until retirement (67), these oboe positions only open up once every 20 years.

That is 35k people with oboe degrees over a span of 20 years. Of course, not all of these individuals are looking for an orchestra job, yet it is heavily pushed we strive for these positions that are underpaid and almost unattainable.

After I got my first full-time job in a separate passion, I just fell back in love with my instrument because the financial stress isn't there anymore."
243,"How I got 200,000 streams on Spotify in 9 months as a broke self-published composer (and how you can too)",75,musicians,19," **Disclaimer**: This post is not about the art of making music itself but really only for those who want to get traction on streaming platforms like Spotify. If you're just making music for fun, then don't worry about this post :)

Also! this post is mostly meant for those in instrumentalist genres (no vocals), but a lot of the principles will also apply to vocal genres.

**Why you should read what I have to say:** I've put in hundreds upon hundreds of hours into *researching and applying* how us instrumentalists and composers can gain traction in this over-saturated music world. I'm by no means amazing at marketing but I never give up and keep learning and applying, and *it is showing in my results.* I've gotten 200,000 streams in the past 9 months with no label, no promotional service, and almost no budget. *Just my music, a vision, and me.* By end of this year, I'm hoping and aiming to be around 50-100k steady monthly listeners and getting 100-300k streams a month (This factors in exponential growth. Majority of growth will always be at latter stages of an artist's career).

\---

**Bit of backstory:**

With that said, Hi there! My name is Edin Kaso and I've been playing piano and making music for almost 15 years. It's been an on-and-off hobby of mine during this long period, but recently last summer I decided I would start releasing piano compositions regularly. Now here was the problem...I'm a HUGE procrastinator, always coming up with tons of ideas but never finishing anything. So at this point last summer I had not finished ANY piano compositions (except for just one I made back in 2012 which was quite mediocre in my opinion). I did write finished music in different genres - pop, musical theatre, jazz etc, because I had to for deadlines, but I never had a deadline for any of my piano pieces...So I decided June 2022 to start putting deadlines on myself to start finishing my piano compositions and started with my first release in July 2022.

Since then I've learned so much about marketing music! It's a whole world in of itself, but I'll try to consolidate what I've learned down below.

**INTRO:**

Before we start, it's a given you're already composing decent music (the key here is *objectively* good, not subjectively). Solid composition, Solid performance and recording (If MIDI it NEEDS to sound like a real person playing the instrument), and decently mixed and mastered. **Because none of this will work if the music is not up to standard in each of these areas.** So this means you or your family and close friends' opinions cannot be considered here. You'll have to hear it from mostly strangers if possible (even on the internet). There are a lot of music reviewing websites where you can get your music reviewed. Also, just posting on the internet on places like reddit or forums etc, will tell you. Don't be afraid to ask for feedback from composers/artists/musicians you admire too (and make sure to ask for honest critique here). Just don't be too spammy!

\---

**1.** **Your #1 Goal is to gain favor with the Spotify algorithm**

Now people might say the organic route through social media and TikTok works better (posting viral content) and it definitely is! ...but the problem with instrumental genres (especially original music), is it's VERY VERY hard to gain traction compared to vocal genres. It is definitely possible, but you'd have to really nail your content down, approach, and audience (something I personally am still trying to figure out)

*You still want to use social media though because it's going to help fuel the Spotify algorithm.*

***Always remember this: Spotify is built like a social media platform. You give it good engagement and it will push out your music to more people, you give it bad engagement and it will stop promoting your music. Spotify itself will do much of the work for you in getting your music to new listeners and getting ""viral"" on Spotify.*** What this means is you DON'T want to give it tons of random engagement. Stop pitching to random playlists genres and trying to get on every single playlist. Stop sharing your music to audiences that have shown to not like or engage with it. Stop buying ""promotional services"" or botted streams or playlists (and bot streams have the worst engagement you'll ever give to the system, so you can kiss your sweet Spotify algorithm goodbye if you do this).

**What constitutes good engagement and bad engagement is fairly simple.**

**Positive:**

\- A listen (over 30 seconds of play)

\-Listening to full track, and re-listening

\-""Liking"" a song or adding to personal playlist

\-Following artist

**Negative:**

\-Skipping a song (THAT'S IT!)

You want as much positive engagement as possible, and as little negative engagement as possible. You do this by putting your music in front of audiences that will like it. Bots DO NOT count (even if they don't skip and they ""like"" your music) because Spotify has no sensical data on these fake listeners (because they're fake!) and Spotify needs real positive engagement to form YOUR ideal listener's profile. If you bot, your algorithm WILL be screwed up.

Everything we talk about below will connect back to the Spotify algorithm.

\---

**2. Importance of Playlisting for Instrumental Genres.**

Playlisting is a huge part of instrumental genres. For the majority of listeners, instrumental music doesn't tend to be in the forefront and is usually in the background while they are doing something. As it result it fits more into dedicated playlist with certain themes. The good news is many people seek out instrumental music when doing activities (studying, reading, sleeping, work, etc) and these activities make up most of people's days, which means there is a huge demand for instrumental music in these ways!

\-**Pitch to the right playlists.** Pitch to playlists in your genre and artists with similar sounds. This will give you good engagement. There are some credible and some lesser credible playlist submission sites. Make sure the playlist is not fake or botted. You can do this by using playlist analyzing sites or services. Any huge spike in follower growth or loss is a huge sign it's a fake playlist (not always the case for growth though because it could be from as shoutout from a big influencer etc... but whenever it's a loss spike, 100% run the other way. This is Spotify cleaning up all the bots in their system and it'll show in that playlist's sudden loss of followers. Hundreds of people will not suddenly unfollow a playlist all at the same time). If you can't use such a service, you can still tell by looking at playlist size (botted playlists will usually have far less tracks than non-botted ones), user profile who created playlist (if a lot of their followers have random names and letters, be wary), or if they ask for PAYMENT, this is a DEAD giveaway. Also, random genres in a playlist is concerning too.

Remember, even if you pitch to a real playlist with a mix of random genres, you're going to get a lot more skips on your track (which is bad!). So choose wisely which ones to submit to.

**-Network with playlist curators.** This is a very fundamental part of instrumental genres. Get to know the curators in your genre, and don't be spammy. Curators usually are musicians themselves too with their music on Spotify. So take an interest in their music. Also, make your own playlists and add similar artists and sounds. Work at growing your playlist followers through ads, reddit, social media, sharing, SEO. *This will not only help your own engagement, but will also help in networking with other curators.* You can add their music in your playlist and often times they'd be happy to add yours to theirs. Over time, this will keep re-enforcing good engagement for Spotify.

\---

**3. Brand awareness and targeting your ideal audience.**

**You need to know exactly who your audience is, and you can't say ""everyone"".** If you make jazz music and you promote it to K-POP listeners in their teens YOU WILL FAIL. Everyone has their tastes and preferences. Even if you were Jesus making the most heavenly music and you released to Spotify, it still unfortunately would not appeal to everyone. Find YOUR audience, and think of similar artists with existing audiences you could target. For me, it was targeting people who loved Studio Ghibli music (as a lot of people say my music is similar) and it's been doing wonders.

**Also have a clear and consistent brand and vision.** I ended up clearly developing mine only months after my first release and even have a clear aesthetic to go with it, so it doesn't happen right away...but make this one of your goals too. Now when people discover my music, they know what I'm about right away. You want clarity in your vision. So this means you can't be making jazz music and then all of a sudden making heavy metal for your next release. You WILL fail, no matter how good the music is. **Clear and consistent image is key, so when new listeners find you they know exactly what you're about.**

**Promoting live, on social media, ads.** I personally prefer not to promote live as I want to remain anonymous. But there's so many options...busking, events, streaming, etc etc (I can't say much about these since I haven't done them though). But for me what has been working is engaging with communities where my potential audience is. Discords, subreddits, social media, etc. This does not mean spamming my music, but it does mean actually talking with these ones and then when there is a rapport, then sharing my music. Also, I will occasionally share new releases when appropriate. I have experimented with reddit ads, Facebook and Instagram ads, and Spotify ads. The only good results I've experienced with is Spotify. I will say though, because I don't have much of a budget I just didn't give the other ads enough volume and data (since these are self-learning algorithms) to start to show results. For me, Spotify Marquee seems to be much better this way, since it lets you target the audience of another artist (in my case I just targeted Joe Hisaishi's audience).

**4. Building momentum and few more tips for Spotify algorithm.**

**Make sure you release regularly. Once every 4 weeks is best.** Spotify is just like a social media platform. So the more active you are and the more engaged with it's systems, the more it will prioritize in promoting you. The most important way is to release regularly. Also regularly update your bio, artist pick, add Spotify canvas, add artist playlists etc. These help too.

The two biggest ways Spotify promotes you is through algorithm playlists. You get on these playlists by giving Spotify enough *good engagement.* Release Radar is especially crucial. You can get on release radar for up to 28 days after a release, which is why I personally recommend releasing every 4 weeks. This will ensure you're always on this algorithmic playlist being pushed out to new listeners.

Release Radar gets pushed out to all your followers, but if you want it to really push out to new listeners, the first 24 hours after release is the most crucial window, and the 2nd most crucial is the first week after. *You want to give it as much positive engagement as possible within this timeframe.* Ask friends and family to listen and save. Post on social media (use smartlinks to keep track of data and CTR) right after release! Release videos of you performing etc etc. This is the main way I've been using social media, to kickstart a release's momentum and algorithm. If you do this every release, momentum WILL build for your artist profile, and **SPOTIFY ITSELF will be on your side doing A LOT of the promoting for you.**

244,Why is every musician a cool person?,75,musicians,323,"It could be because they are rare and unmoved but also just their mannerisms or style?

247,I'm sad,77,musicians,164,"You guys probably have heard of Suno ai or Udio. These are top ai companies hell bent on replicating our creativity and offering it to the world like it was a fast food item! It is obvious theft.

I hope there's something we can all do to band together against this injustice. I think ai companies should be forced to pay artists that have had their music ripped for the sake of making an ai song. These ai models are just code and the code leaves an unbiased digital trail. Royalties can certainly be traced this way. The corporations need to be held accountable and the artists, who are unknowingly being used to help produce these songs, need to be compensated. 

Also let's cool it down on making fun of JoJo Siwa. It's even hurting my feelings at this point.

Edit: there's a couple of confident idiots rolling around in the comment section. But don't let that deter the rest of you all from having an opinion. I appreciated a lot of them and I've gained hope from them, thank you."
248,How do you get over stage fright? ,77,musicians,203,"I‚Äôm in my late 30s and just recently got into playing music again after a 15 hiatus. I have been in a band now for a couple years. We have been recording and mixing remotely since we all have families and don‚Äôt live that close to each other. We‚Äôve already released a couple albums and have played live a few times recently. Playing live is completely brand new to me and so far, I hate it. I have severe social anxiety, which makes it extremely difficult for me to perform in front of people. I even feel anxious playing in person with just them as it is and we don‚Äôt all meet up that often. I started doing vocals over the last year so that‚Äôs also new to me and I get extremely nervous singing in front of anyone. Is this something that eventually will subside? In addition to my anxiety, I am also only familiar with using a DAW and working for my laptop, so I‚Äôm also unfamiliar with analog or stage gear and everything sounds different to me that way too. I have a bit of a perfectionist quality in me and my live vocals don‚Äôt sound nearly as good as my studio vocals too, which I know is the standard, but I‚Äôm trying to get over this. How do you conquer all of these things and are able to eventually enjoy playing out to people?

249,What's you're biggest regret as a musician?,73,musicians,295,
250,Best gig you‚Äôve ever had,75,musicians,136,"Saw a rant about the worst gig someone had, so wondering what your best was?

I‚Äôm a proponent of the law of attraction. I got a book on it a decade ago and the first thing was to ask the universe for a gift, so I did. Later that night I had a show, where I had a transcendent experience. At some point during our set, I hit a flow state deeper than any other time, where I was so deeply focused on listening to the other instruments I wasn‚Äôt even aware of my movements playing, but could hear them lining up perfectly. It almost felt like an out of body experience because it was like my conscious awareness was no longer within myself, but in perfect unison with my three band mates as we formed a single cell amoeba to move forward through the music in the physical reality we live it. I‚Äôm not sure this description even properly captures it, but I‚Äôve been chasing that vibe ever since. The effortlessness of performing so deep in the pocket was incredible.

Edit: Holy shit so many responses! Can‚Äôt wait to get off work and read em :D"
251,"Classic rock audiences can't even tell when the shows they go to have ""computer music,"" ""use autotune,"" and ""are lip-synced""",76,musicians,159,"Not a musician, but my dad's friend gave him two tickets to see ""The 80s Rock Tour"" a few months ago. It was basically a ""greatest hits revue"" with Lou Gramm, John Payne (former Asia lead singer), and Steve Augeri (former Journey lead singer). My mom has no interest in concerts, so my dad gave me a ticket.

The whole car ride there, my dad's friend went on and on about how ""music these days is so fake, everything has autotune, and everyone lip syncs."" When we sat down, I heard at least 3 boomer couples echoing similar sentiments about ""computer music."" This would turn out to be extremely ironic.

At the show, all of the instrument playing seemed to be real since I heard them mess up and play weirdly out of sync a couple of times, but during choruses where the whole band sang backing vocals, there were some really embarrassing moments. I'll just share two, but holy shit there were so many.

During ""Lights,"" there were audible harmonies during the first ""whoa-oh-ohohoh"" part (probably to hide the fact that Steve was struggling massively to sing) which the band apparently missed. It was kinda funny to see the two guitar players rush back to their mics to make it look like they were singing, but they completely missed their cues and had to wait for the next ""whoa"" part. They looked pretty flustered and sheepish after that.

Then, during ""Jukebox Hero,"" which was supposed to be the climax of the entire show, Lou barely squeaked out his really high ""jukebox hero"" lines at the end, but suddenly you couldn't hear the ""jukebox hero, stars in his eyes"" backing vocals anymore even though the band was singing those words into the mics. This time, they all looked embarrassed, then suddenly the last ""stars in his eeeyyyyyeeees"" line of the whole song blared out of the speakers, which the band missed the first part of in their embarrassment. You could see them rushing to their mics again.

An extended minutes-long standing ovation and boomer screaming followed that last prerecorded line, and my dad's friend said on the way back ""see Diligent, this is real music, no fake shit here"" I tried to tell him what I saw during ""Jukebox Hero,"" but he vehemently insisted ""Lou would never allow that.""

It was funny.

Don't even get me started on the Eagles concert we saw last spring. Way more expensive and vocal and *instrument* tracks somehow even more blatantly obvious.

252,I won an award today at a gig!,73,musicians,17,"I work for a university. They were having a ceremony and I performed the music for the event.

During the Dean‚Äôs speech, he presented me with an ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù award for outstanding contributions, in front of the entire college!

253,Why are your friends actually not your fanbase?,75,musicians,135,"I‚Äôm really just putting this out there to see if people have experienced this, seen it in their own life, etc. I‚Äôm hopeful people will chime in with some good insight.

Okay so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve noticed that, and this works with any art form, but for me, it‚Äôs music. Your friends can genuinely love what you‚Äôre making but they don‚Äôt actually listen to it or really support. You post your stuff on IG, Tiktok, etc and the people who actually comment and LISTEN to it are people from all over the world who have never met you.

One theory I have is that, it has to do with some sort of ‚Äúfame‚Äù mask in the sense that because your friends/acquaintances actually DO know you, it‚Äôs like, not as cool. The people who don‚Äôt actually know you have a completely UNBIASED opinion of you and maybe get that illusion of ‚Äúfame‚Äù from you. Trust me I‚Äôm not famous, that‚Äôs not what I mean. I mean that like you‚Äôre mysterious. I hope that all makes sense.

Another thing is comments/likes/shares. Like even some seriously close friends I‚Äôve had won‚Äôt take the time to support in those ways. But that random person from Russia will make a whole post about you and be SUPER supportive. Which makes me think they ACTUALLY like the music. Just like I said earlier, even the friends actually do think the music is good, and would probably actually listen to it if it wasn‚Äôt you making it.

It‚Äôs all just really interesting to me. Please share your opinions, thoughts, concerns (:"

258,Getting Big Timed by Local Acts,74,musicians,47,"Sort of a PSA / rant, sorry if it doesn‚Äôt belong here.

I‚Äôm so sick of small local / regional acts who have a hint of success acting like they‚Äôre too cool or too important to communicate with smaller or newer artists. It‚Äôs beyond stupid and so childish. I‚Äôve been in the scene locally on and off for like 15 years and it never fails. Some band gets big headed over landing a few cool gigs or doing really well with engagement on socials or streaming, then they start ignoring messages, acting like they‚Äôre too cool to talk to you at shows you‚Äôre supporting them on, not taking the time to promote the smaller bands at shows or online, etc. 

I‚Äôm not bitter about it or anything, but it‚Äôs so beyond disrespectful and I swear every time I‚Äôve ever seen it the band is riding a wave of momentum that doesn‚Äôt last. My band has had big successful runs locally where we just crushed show turnout, streams, engagement, etc but we would never do that to some other band just looking to book a gig or say hi at a show. Just remember if you‚Äôre in a comfortable position and you feel like you‚Äôve had a lot of success, you had to start near the bottom too and it‚Äôs hard. Be nice to people in other bands. They might blow up and be the band you‚Äôd benefit from opening for in a year."

It really is your own people, I think it's sick in the brain to blame another person's success on your shortcomings, when you see a hater in the comments of a artist or musician, click on there profile I gurentee they will be another musician with less skills or less following.

edit, 

 not talking about myself, I am an artist and I get some hate but I see it more on other peoples pages,my algorithms on social media are definitely set to small ‚Äãindie artists and bands.

For the past 6 months we practiced together twice a week to get ready for our Halloween show, and it was our first time doing this all together. We played to a packed, tiny DIY venue and it was a massive high. Even if it's not that many people... the vibes, how solid our set was, and the crowd energy combined truly felt huge for us. 

Today, I'm just sitting here like,.. What now? All that work, all the hangouts and practices, and finally this big adrenaline rush of getting to pour everything into the performance.

I've spent so many days, months, and hours sitting in my room. Singing into a recording device... as I got older I realized that for me the embodiment of music is performing for others. That are going to connection between you, the instrument, and the audience.

Growing up I was in bands here and there and sometimes as you get older those memories fade and those muscle memory kind of goes in the background. This year I sort of forced myself to do some open mics.

It awakened something in me I can't quite explain and opened up some social doors and pathways. I was scared shitless and almos bailed a few times. But guys get out there and perform.

But in music, I can‚Äôt help to think that mediocrity just fails to attract any attention, evoke emotion or anything else that a listener expects. As a result, there is no prospect in it for a person who does not at least attempt to constantly elevate their craft.

286,Why did you stop playing music and how long did it take you to start back again? What was your reason for starting again?,68,musicians,65,"I played piano starting at 10 years old all the way through high school but stopped due to anxiety (life anxiety, academic anxiety, performance anxiety) and not feeling really connected to the piano anymore. Though I loved music, I just didn't want to play anymore. Maybe just was burnt out or didn't really know my reason for playing music. I felt like I was lost as a musician and as a teen in that season of my life. I didn't really know who I was. 

Here I am 30 years old and have started playing  around on my piano again and something just feels right this time.

Ive loved all types of different singing styles over the years, but I want to rock so bad. I thought I had a voice for it but something didn't feel right.

I finally started vocal lessons a few years ago and Ive been practicing and listening to myself sing all types of different styles. But the one that feels the most comfortable for me is folk music üò≠.

I know all I have to do is write folk rock but I'm just pissed off that my voice is meant for that and I'm not made for harsh strong sounds that rock needs. I have a strong powerful sound but it only works properly with the ups and downs folk has and I'm unhappy about it.

Do any other singers have this? Or any one have any advice?

300,"Musicians, let‚Äôs hear you musical origin story. What inspired you to pick up your instrument?",67,musicians,122,"Here‚Äôs mine. When I was roughly 18, I had just been kicked out of college and lacked purpose. I tended to find my purpose at the bottom of a bottle, whether a bottle of liquor or pills. I was in need of something and I wasn‚Äôt sure what that was. March, 2005 some friends and I were at Tybee island for the weekend, drinking partying, doing beach things. Late one night we walked out on the beach to go on the prowl for something‚Ä¶.other night owls, fresh air. Maybe a fight. Who knows. We walked up the side step to the pier to go to the bathroom and that‚Äôs when I heard music coming from the front part of the pier near the road. I followed the sound and there sat a gentleman, case open, sitting in the bench attached to the pier, strumming a guitar. We sat for what seemed like hours and listened to him play. He informed us that he would be playing at a bar the following night and was just out busking for practice. He played a lot of 90s tunes, classic rock stuff. The song that still sticks out to me is, ‚ÄúTurn The Page‚Äù by Bob Seger. It was amazing! I asked the guy how long he had been playing and he told me ‚Äú8 months‚Äù. 8 freakin months! Right there in that moment a lightbulb went off and I knew I was going to buy a guitar and learn to play. 

The following week was my birthday. I was turning 19. My Gf at the time bought me a cheap, shitty pawnshop guitar and proceeded to play every second of everyday. I had found my purpose. I wasn‚Äôt working as I had been kicked out of school, as I mentioned before. I‚Äôm positive I annoyed my parents to death with my beginner guitar, but I was hooked. The first song I learned was ‚ÄúTurn The Page‚Äù by Bob Seger, believe it or not. Quickly followed by ‚ÄúLet Her Cry‚Äù by Hootie and the Blowfish. Both relatively easy beginner tunes. 

This was in 2005. I was 18. It is now 2023, I am 37. I have 14 guitars, a degree in music production and a passion for music that I may have never happened upon had I not met a stranger, on a pier, in Tybee island, playing simple tunes who had only been playing guitar for 8 months. Thank you, sir."

309,Watch the other bands?,70,musicians,154,"If my band is playing a show I try my very best to watch every band that's on the bill but I've noticed more often than not other bands don't do the same for us. 

My question is do you consider this rude or is it something that should be considered normal?"
310,Am I an idiot?,66,musicians,186,"Am I an idiot for trying to get back into music at 32? I sang as a child into my teens. I‚Äôve always wanted to learn guitar. A couple months ago it was like a switch went off in my brain and I picked up my dad‚Äôs old guitar and started learning some chords. I‚Äôm making my way through learning country roads. I reconnected with a singing teacher from my childhood and started a trial month of classes. I now have the choice to sign up for a year of classes and I‚Äôm not going to lie it‚Äôs not cheap. I mean it‚Äôs not cheap to learn anything. Especially if you‚Äôre trying to learn to do something with competence. I‚Äôm conflicted. Reconnecting with the music side of my life has been so nice on so many levels. I distanced myself from music for so many years for so many complicated reasons. I won‚Äôt go into it all, but distancing myself from music was influenced by religious trauma and grief. But I guess seeing the price tag made me realize how much I‚Äôm asking for. Like am I an idiot for wanting to do this for myself? Am I selfish for wanting to spend this much money on something? I feel like I‚Äôm asking for too much from my husband. I‚Äôm also worried that it will be a waste of time. My husband and I are looking to have a baby in 2024. I‚Äôm worried that once that happens will I even have the time? Will it turn out to just be a waste of money? Will I not be able to keep up with it and just toss everything to the side? Has anyone had any luck finding that balance? Even now I struggle and am not able to practice daily like I would want to. Any advice is welcome.

Edit: Wow! I‚Äôve never had so many comments on a post. I‚Äôm seriously overwhelmed with all the kind words and encouragement. I‚Äôm sorry I am unable to reply to everyone, but I read every comment. I know so many of you are professional musicians and have dedicated your life to music. And there are those who have taken the big leap to make music their life‚Äôs work after doing something else. There are those of you that shared you started your music journey later on in life. And those that even have been able to balance being a parent and a musician. I admire you all greatly. I‚Äôm thankful to all that responded. It has inspired me more than you will ever know. I‚Äôm wishing you all love, happiness, and success in whatever you choose to do with your lives üíó

311,Music theory is not a set of rules. This is not a subjective opinion. It is a fact.,65,musicians,15,"If you already know this, this post is not for you. I‚Äôm going to say the things that I wish someone had said when I both started studying music more formally and when I got to a point where I felt boxed in by the way it was taught.

Music theory is descriptive. It is not prescriptive. Playing non-diatonically is not against music theory. Not following some interpretation of the circle of fifths is not a violation of the circle of fifths or music theory.

Music theory is more like a language than anything else. You take the major scale and base intervals on it because you have to start somewhere. It isn‚Äôt grammatically incorrect to play something outside of your key. Jazz, blues, punk and death metal aren‚Äôt genres based around ‚Äúbreaking the rules of music theory‚Äù. There are no rules, only explanations and terms to describe something so that you can communicate with other musicians and recall options to try certain chords and intervals when you‚Äôre stuck about where to go next.

There are examples where theory can be used as guidelines. Say you want to play something that sounds like a certain band, or you want to understand what makes that band sound the way that it does. You can analyze that band‚Äôs music and you can do ‚Äúok so there are a lot of chromatic mediants, and they play the flat 2 a lot despite most of their music being diatonically in the standard minor scale‚Äù, and then you can apply that to either writing your own music or writing something that sounds like something they might write. Still, though, in this example, there will be plenty of examples of even that particular band ‚Äúbreaking its own rules‚Äù, because, again, they are no rules, and music is made by people and people crave variety, so even when they write four songs with one scale or similar scales, there will be variation, and there will like be four others on the same album that use a totally different scale.

Music theory is great. I love it. It‚Äôs something I think about a lot, but only recently did I get my head around fully understanding that its purpose is not to put is in a cage, and it isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúlearning the rules so that you can know when to break them‚Äù. It‚Äôs just about understanding all your options."
312,"Hey, just wondering if anyone knows what this is?",70,musicians,54,

316,Rant: I'm a longtime musician whose struggling not to hate even the very concept of music anymore,64,musicians,231,"So I've been playing music my whole life, and guitar especially since I was in middle school. I've loved it and enjoyed it my whole life. Music has been a major part of who I am. I've played for fun, played gigs for money, played just for the sake of it, etc. I enjoy all genres, country, math rock, metal, gospel, everything. I just loved music.

Writing music has always been my favorite part of music, and composition is the main driver for why I have continued to play. I can't listen to songs without ""hearing"" new parts, so as a result I've never really listened to much music, plus I get more obsessed with whatever new earworm popped into my head. Moreover, I sing my own made up melodies in church (we do acapella only) since I can express the music I feel like should be. I can't even walk around without getting my own made up melodies stuck in my head, and the only cure has always been to learn the part on an instrument. As a result, I've made a lot of great songs, some fading into obscurity and some gaining some traction, though I only ever did it for its own sake rather than that it would be appreciated--like if a song I kept hearing against my will didn't exist and I didn't actualize it then it felt almost like the world was not right and thus I must actualize it. Music has become such apart of my life, my son's middle name is a pun for music (that I can't share since this is a throwaway).   


Lately, though, I just look at all my gear, all my skills, the time I've spent on its vanity, and I just find myself filled with disgust and resentment. I hate that I spend time playing music rather than learn a practical skill like wood working or being with my family. I hate that I am so drawn to an instrument, and I hate that I can't bring myself to rid myself of them as many were gifts. I find myself now even hating everything about the concept of melody, harmony, rhythm, the fact its intelligible, the fact it manipulates emotions for better or for worse rather than what the person genuinely feels without modification. I hate that it distracts me, I hate the fact that I can't be free of it when I sleep at night and a melody comes to me against my will. I hate that I can't go to church and worship without hearing music, that even when I try to ""shut off"" and just focus on the Lord. I hate that I can't escape the unheard melodies plaguing me as a lock up my house at night, nor can I walk around listening to a podcast without some made up sound tormenting me. I hate that I can't sit in silence in my car without an old song coming to mind, or a conversation with someone reminding me of a song I once heard and the melody embedding itself into me. I hate that I can't listen to other people's music without wanting to join in or appreciating it as it already is. I hate the idea of monetizing my music to the extent that I live off it, but I also hate the idea of not monetizing something I've spent so much time and effort refining. I hate the feeling of shame of playing instead of doing something else, and I hate the shame of feeling like I wasted my life refining a vain skill.  


I don't feel burnt out; I feel cursed. I love music, I think, but I am becoming overwhelmed with disdain and hatred for it. Honestly, I **never** want to hear another note again in my life again, questioning if I would be happier deaf, but I also shudder at the idea as I doubt I could escape my curse of creativity."
317,Listening to your own music,66,musicians,58,"Does anyone else have days where you listen to your own music in the car and there some days where you're thinking this sounds pretty damn good, and then other days you think this is the worst mix ever, how did I approve this?"
318,I got the gig!,66,musicians,8,"Feels great to be playing in a band again after years without a gig. Classic rock/southern rock cover band of a bunch of old dudes, but lots of fun. Just wanted to share a small victory. üíÅ"

321,PSA: It‚Äôs easy for thieves to target musicians. You publicly advertise where you‚Äôll be any given night. After you load out thieves know you‚Äôre probably going somewhere close by to sleep. That‚Äôs an easy target.,66,musicians,11,"I‚Äôve been seeing more and more posts of bands being completely cleaned out of their lives work and gear. It‚Äôs not a fluke. It‚Äôs not hard to follow a van out of a venue. I know the last thing a touring band wants to do is unload at the end of the night, especially when you have to get up early and go. Once you‚Äôre asleep though that gives thieves a solid 8 hours to get in and out. 

It breaks my heart when a guitar player is pleading online for their one of a kind guitar or instrument passes down through the family is gone. It‚Äôs not just bad luck, musicians and bands are an insanely easy target. Just be aware."
322,My parents think my artist name will be detrimental to my ability to succeed in this industry,65,musicians,279,"My artist name is Monarch Atolla. Monarch coming from the Monarch Butterfly, and Atolla coming from the Atolla Jellyfish.

They say that the name is diffcult to remember, and that it has too many negative connotations attached to it. 'Monarch' apparently infers that I am reclusive, and do not wish to be heard; and 'Atolla' apparently sounds too Muslim (they know it's not, and they don't have anything against that fact itself - but they're worried what other people will think of it).

I am also being told that 'Monarch' and its regal connotations are just not suitable for someone like myself, who is.. well.. not royal.

I can see their concern (and I appreciate it), however I can't help but feel like they're overblowing the issue. If people like my music, surely they can look past a name? I mean hey, one of my  favourite bands is literally called the 'Psychedelic Prn Crumpets' (censored for the post) - and they're doing about as well as I'd ever hope to be. I'm not looking to be massive.

Just looking for some extra opinions.  


Edit: Hey everyone, thank you for your replies. However I just want to emphasise that I didn't not make this post to diss my parents or do anything against them. They're incredibly supportive, and I really do appreciate their advise! I wasn't in a great mood seemingly when I made this post so I kind of overlooked that and conveyed their concerns in a bad light, but that's not how I see it. So please, don't be so quick to judge people or their parents. I'm very thankful for them and I was looking for opinions independent of their views or feelings. I apologise for this miscommunication."
323,Music criticism from people who aren't musicians,65,musicians,132,"I find it interesting that some of the worst criticisms you get as a musician, is from people who cannot play an instrument themselves.

I wonder what the motive is, as I would never think of criticising a particular technique if I couldn't do it myself. Musicians criticism always seems to be helpful and informative, while the bad criticism seems to be nothing more than trying to strip you down.

It's an interesting thing to witness, and when they do it they usually end up getting ripped to pieces by everyone else in the audience. 

Human beings are very odd, and in the 19 years I've been doing this, there is always 1."
324,"Why does everyone act like, upon someone saying that they want to pursue music, they're expecting it to be a full time sustainable career immediately?",65,musicians,87,"oh is it fucking precarious? i didn't fucking know, thank you!! yes i definitely expect to be making a steady $75k/yr immediately, OBVIOUSLY. i OBVIOUSLY intend on quitting my job tomorrow because i love playing guitar. god."

So I did, played for an hour, it was a little messy but I'm proud of it, and even though I only had 3 viewers who stayed... it really made me happy. Like dopamine off the charts. I've been unable to see friends for 9 months because my mom is immunocompromised, and this is first time I've truly felt happy since then (other than when my single got 2.3k Soundcloud plays in the first 6 days of being released heh.) Anyways, all this to say... I wasn't sure if I was cut out for music, or if I might get tired of it, but I think I could do this forever. And as someone who stopped planning for the future because they were so suicidal... that feels pretty good :)"

I started July last year so it's been about 15 months exactly. Since then, I've been releasing monthly.

341,"Old friend starting A.I. ""Project""...Am I being petty?",62,musicians,173,"An old friend I've known for a long time (we used to be much closer) has just started experimenting/creating music with A.I. Music Generators. He's not a musician at all - he can come up with some decent melodies sometimes vocally, but can't sing or play an instrument to save his life. He knows I've personally been writing and performing music seriously for the last 20+ years - I'm not even that great at it, but I've worked hard, and I love music as a release and a hangout with my band members.

I get it, this A.I. stuff is going to be part of our world for the forseeable future, so do what makes you happy in your own home. The problem I have is, he's sending me (bragging about) all of these A.I. songs via DM and I don't know how to respond. I'm kinda just like, ""Cool man, technology is pretty neat"", and leave it at that, pretty much ignore the rest of his messages rambling about how hard he worked on these songs of his. He's a really insecure dude, so saying something shitty to him would probably set him off bigtime.

Look, the songs are just horrible, as you could probably understand. Not even that it's not my style of music, but just has that lifeless, robotic, generic sound. He plans on releasing dozens of these songs ASAP.  I'm still OK with this, I can ignore him for the most part.

Now he's turning this into a whole ""project"". He has new artwork, press releases, and even merch...all from A.I. Generators. Not a single ounce of effort other than pressing a few keystrokes. He's on top of the world in his mind making this fake music and blasting it all over his socials as the next big thing that's going to revolutionize the music industry. I could post some of the PR, it would make you gag. People are lifting him up saying how proud they are of him and his brilliant efforts (non-musicians, I'm sure).  My friends and I are sitting here like, hmmmm, really?

Am I being petty about this? Should I even care? I'm not losing sleep over it, but I don't know how to gently let him know that it's pretty damn annoying that I'm out here creating multiple times a week and he's pumping this garbage out with the click of a button. I'll probably just let it fizzle out, though.

Maybe I just needed to air it out and see if anyone here is dealing with a similar thing in their world.

EDIT: Thanks for all the great suggestions and experiences.I've gotten a handful of requests to hear the A.I. songs. I figured at this point it would be OK to upload the songs anonymously to a public Dropbox and Google link if you're curious and want to hear what these sound like. (I'm kinda new to Reddit, so I don't know of there's a better file server I should use).

It's a bunch of songs in one file so you'll have to skip around. You'll get the idea. Obviously some quality loss from downloading from Youtube to MP3, etc.

342,Can I have a music career if I don‚Äôt want to tour? I love writing and performing but traveling is so exhausting ,65,musicians,74,
343,Think I got ghost fired from a band I was about to quit,61,musicians,35,"I had complained a bit ago about a singer songwriter I back. He was unprepared for gigs, often playing out of time, flubbing chords and words. At first it was covers but then it became his own songs. He would never prepare a setlist and take five minutes between each song to decide, sometimes throwing us a song we'd never played before. And he rarely paid unless I really got on his case. 

We have an upcoming gig and I was getting ready to quit. I feel bad as he gave me a chance, before this I'd mostly just played for fun. But the gigs are draining and embarrassing.

I just realized the gig is in a few days and I hadn't heard from him. He'd also posted on our local musicians Facebook group. So I guess I'm out. I can see that as I was growing visibly frustrated. He also never seemed to recognize when he made a mistake, which led me to think he blamed me. 

I guess this may be good, as it spares me a tough conversation. But it feels really unprofessional. Do I talk to him? 

Beyond that, I feel like I should warn people about him. The money thing especially is an issue. But that feels unprofessional on my part.

I just need to hear that I am not crazy and alone because, although I acknowledge there is some talent and good things in these artists' music, what is it that is ‚Äúso good‚Äù that they rule the music industry? I look at any other era, and I see better pop artists and much better themes in their songs. The theme nowadays is apparently the ‚Äúsad girl music.‚Äù Now people will tell me I am misogynistic, but I am a woman too, and I don't have to necessarily enjoy this much of a girly concept. This does not mean I don't support equality in the music industry for women. In fact, it's nice to see many women at the top, but as an independent musician, seeing the same names promoted is frustrating. People now call Taylor Swift the ‚Äúmusic industry‚Äù itself and enjoy this. Don't they see this is not a good thing for providing equal opportunities to musicians? People tell me Swift is an excellent songwriter. I cannot see it though? Is writing the same chord progression all over again with auto-tuned vocals and not showcasing any instrumental genius considered as good songwriting nowadays? I like John Mayer's songwriting or Jose Gonzalez or Steve Lukather. They use some interesting chord progressions and lyricism. Also, I feel like there is an aggressiveness in these music's fans. They do not want to accept someone might not like it. They try to dominate the trend and thats why her camapaign was so successful.The music actually reflects all of these peoples personality. It is always about a girl who thinks she is right and everyone is wrong. What's wrong with the new society? Can we please be better and try to appreciate more indie artists instead of religiously supporting mediocre pop music without meaning? I know I will get lots of hate for this post and my frustration might have blinded my view in some points like generalizing so much or overseeing some good songs billie and rodrigo has but this whole thing just doesnt look like its going for better."

I began getting involved in my music scene last year and I've met great people, however, the two locally important people who throw ""shows"" hate me. They hate me because I didn't agree with having to pay to play or sell tickets so I decided to throw my own free shows.

They hated that. And told me I was ""ruining the market"".
The people who run with those ""brands"" also do not like me because I told people to throw their own shows to ruin their ""market"" and people have. 

I've lost friends here because I didn't remain silent when they screwed me over countless times. This also lead to people hating me. 

Not EVERYONE dislikes me in my hometown and a good amount support me actually, but I did lose a considerable amount of followers.

373,Yes! You should use your gift!,59,musicians,34,"I see a lot of posts here about musicians wondering if they should just give it all up and stop making music. There are a few reasons for their angst, and many are well founded, and I see where they are coming from. But let me just add my two cents worth by stating the obvious truth:

You have a gift, the ability to play and create music. Never let that part of you go.

I know that sounds easier to said than done when it seems like no one is listening, you have no online followers, you're broke and need to get a paying job, etc. But that misses the point: you have the ability to make music and fill the world with beautiful sounds. So you should even if it seems it's just for your own pleasure. You love music so much you took the time to learn an instrument, and you love it so much that you're having a crisis about not doing it.

Ever since I was a young kid, I was making up poems and songs. I decided I wanted to be a ""real poet"", got an MFA and tried to get published in literary mags. So I spent quite a few years submitting to everywhere I could, only to pile up rejection letters. At some point I realized that I vastly enjoyed doing poetry readings instead of banging my head against the wall trying to get published in a magazine with less than a thousand subscribers. I've read in front of some big crowds, and as people came up to tell me they liked my poetry, those dreams of little magazines just faded away. I also altered the dream by leaving my part time college teaching to get a full time job teaching high school English and coaching football.

I also started playing guitar in my early twenties, a little over thirty years ago, mainly to play three songs: Tangled up in Blue, Melissa, and Eyes of the World. I am the original Uncle Strummy, and for about 15 of those years I was a less than mediocre fire pit singer. But it was so much fun. Soon my guitar playing got good enough to create original music, and there was the joyful confluence of my two dream streams, poetry and guitars. Now I play in a couple bands with sporadic small crowd gigs, and am having the time of my life in my late fifties. It's absolutely worth the work and the wait to be able to play music. 90% of the music I play is out on my picnic table under a wild cherry with only the birds, cats and assorted varmints as an audience. But it is my joy just to play and have my music be part of the Great Stream of Music.

Don't give up your gift because you struggle with your own version of success. Art is struggle sometimes. And often it's the struggle that leads you to a deeper understanding of your gift. Remember that we've only had recorded music, and the fame and fortune it brings, for a little over a hundred years. Before that, most every musician was fairly anonymous, except for some famous composers. They played for small crowds and at best had a local notoriety. I mean, who was the best harpist of the 13th century? How much money did that virtuoso lute player who could shred make in the Court of King Arthur?

Don't give up your gift! The world needs you to create beauty and joy with your music. Be part of the Great Stream, even if it's only you and some yard varmints."
374,unpopular opinion: musicians should care about getting good PAs more,60,musicians,97,"I get like if you're a college kid just starting out, or you don't have a lot of money, then securing quality gear can be tough. But what I don't get is people who pay thousands of dollars for made in America gibsons or fenders, pay thousands more for an amp, not to mention pedals, and yet will cheap out and try to buy whatever bottom of the barrel $200 PA they can find off craigslist. (Or drums or whatever your instrument is, I'm just picking on guitarists because I am one and they're most likely to also be the singers) Like not to be a douche but no one in the audience is gonna hear the difference between a squier and a fender, but they will notice if they can't hear you singing or the PA is squealing. I'm just saying it's priorities. Buy yourself whatever super expensive nice gear you want, but maybe put some thought into what is actually going to translate into the best experience for your audience. I've seen way too many bands playing Gibsons into Mesas but with the shitty 20 year old harby main that can't even get louder than me farting into a toilet bowl. Thank you for coming to my tedtalk. "
375,Talking on Mic between songs as a live performer,58,musicians,84,"I have been a professional musician for 20+ years, I know over 500 songs by request, and I am super confident in my performing ability. But as an introvert who is not a huge fan of small talk, the thing that I hate most about that job is the hosting - talking on the mic between songs. It has plagued me for 20 years and I‚Äôve never gotten that much better at it. In fact, I have sort of settled into being a kind of Zen performer that doesn‚Äôt talk very much and lets the music speak for itself.

That said, I would like to get better at the emcee / talk part. 

Most of the time when a song ends, I really just don‚Äôt know what to say besides Thank You. Especially during FOUR hour sets. 

I would love if you all could help me come up with an ACTUAL BULLET POINT LIST OF IDEAS I could draw from. Especially if they are general. If I had a list of like 20 prompts, I could just pull from those on sort of rotation until I eventually got better. 

Thanks in advance!"

377,I got rejected by music school - didn't pass the audition. I'm crying my eyes out. Not sure what to do now.,59,musicians,32,"I'm sorry if I sound incoherent...I just received the audition outcome from the school that I applied for, and it had been a 2-month wait since I submitted my audition tape (everything was done online). I knew I didn't do well, my videos are far from flawless. And I know I'm the one to blame.

I always start so late with everything, not just with this audition; but in the past I always start practising my repertoire intensely only a few weeks before a recital/performance/exam. I'm crying my eyes out. I don't know why I'm like this, I feel like I'm just screwing myself over and over. Maybe I just don't have the discipline and talent to be a competent classical musician?

I have been reading rejection posts online, and I see a lot of comments saying 'if it's your dream/passion, don't give up!' honestly, at this point I don't even know if music is my passion anymore, or has it ever been? Sometimes I think maybe I identify myself so strongly as a classical musician only because I'm pretty much useless without my instrument. I have never worked a 'normal' job in my life, and I don't know anything other than music (and classical music is the only genre I'm familiar with anyway). I have imagined myself having a different career, a more 'real-world' one, but then I get the feeling that I'd rather be dead.

I think I wouldn't have taken the rejection so hard if I was younger, but I'm turning 25 soon (The audition was for a masters programme) and I feel like I'm running out of time. I feel absolutely useless because I have achieved nothing. I feel sick thinking about auditioning for a different school not because I don't want to try again but long-hour practice sessions are starting to feel like a privilege. And even if I get in, I would be approaching my late 20s...

I feel so stuck, and my mental and physical health are also going downhill...I feel so ashamed and like I have failed my teachers and family."

A ""friend"" of my former band offered us to record our first EP and charged us per hour. He was learning how to produce and was able to provide a professional studio because of his school. We were his first project and my band didn't care we were being charged. We had high expectations of his quality because of the equipment he was using but that wasn't the case. Our EP came out to have extremely low sound quality. GarageBand or a simple track recording app on your phone could beat his quality. Not long after finishing the EP he stopped talking to us.

Prior to him, we had another student learning how to produce. He offered us one free song and recorded us in his dorm with an interface and a laptop. His work was actually amazing."

395,How to completely soundproof apartment so I don‚Äôt get evicted,59,musicians,275,"Dealing with a nightmare situation with our building manager who completely took a 180 in personality once the eviction ban was lifted. I‚Äôm a harpist and my fianc√© is a pianist. He can wear headphones when practicing but my harp is acoustic. Apparently people are complaining left and right about my harp practicing. Our apartment walls are paper thin, but I still find this whole thing ridiculous as people have complained as early as 2 pm, and it‚Äôs a fricking harp for crying out loud. But I digress.

396,Played my first gig with my band last night,58,musicians,11,"Hi everyone 

I just wanted to share how my first gig went. I‚Äôm lead guitar in a metal band and we released our first single almost a year ago followed up with 4 other singles since then. We‚Äôve held off doing a gig as we wanted to get as polished as we could and utilise in-ear monitoring which has taken a bit to setup. The longer we put it off though, the more nervous and in my head I got about it. 

I had two guitar solos to play, one of which is very hard and I can only play to about 50-80% accuracy each time I practice 

Well we hit the stage last night in an opening slot to about 70 people and had an amazing time! Myself and another member were counting the minutes and getting really (good) nervous as the minutes passed. We played really well, kept on time, I nailed my two guitar solos, and all and all had a great time. The crowd were singing along and some strangers were throwing down at the front! I didn‚Äôt hear at the time because of my ears but someone recorded the solo on their phone and immediately after someone screamed out ‚Äúfuck yeah!‚Äù

399,"In light of recent events, it should be understood Ultimate Guitar is a Russian company.",59,musicians,128,"With everything that's going on, I think it's time we came to the realization that UG is a Russian company. I know it might be a little touchy to this community, but there's no getting around the fact the most popular place many of us go to get guitar and bass tabs is Russian owned.

It's servers are also located in Russia. Which is another thing to consider, because despite their touting they have publishing deals to allow tabs, it seems the opposite is the truth. **They are allowed to operate because being in Russia allows them to ignore royalties and publishing rights.** I'll quote from an article in the New York Times:

""Doug Osborn, an executive vice president with Ultimate-Guitar.com said his site violated no laws because its headquarters were in Russia, and the site‚Äôs practices complied with Russian laws.""

https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/technology/21ecom.html

I've been vocal in the past about UG and it's poor practices. I think it's time that we as a community came together, even if it's just some small part, and stop using UG.

Edit: I bolded the part musicians need to understand. No matter what you think about the war Russia wages with Ukraine, UG resides in Russia to order to break copyright law. And screw over musicians."

403,"How to Prepare for Recording in the Studio: You might not be the best player in the room, but you can certainly be the most prepared (by a Musician, for the Musician)",56,musicians,9,">**Will Clarke**, owner of **Prana Recording Studio** Agency in Atlanta, GA has contributed to this article.

# 1. Practice your songs to a click

Unless you are recording a LIVE album, practicing your music to a metronome makes overdubbing or any sort of correction in **Post-Production** incredibly easy. I know many engineers that will not record without a click simply to avoid the headache. If your musical group has music (*or a drummer*) that fluctuates between tempos, you need to rehearse the music to per-determined **BPM** before showing up to your session.

# 2. Show up Prepared

My opinion is: A great studio session is one that runs quickly and efficiently. If you and your band mates are pressured into last minute problems or troubleshooting (*such as vocal delivery, guitar melody, or rhythm section misalignment*), it can be a real strain on the recording process.

If you are looking to become a session musician, remember this saying: ***You might not be the best player in the room, but you can certainly be the most prepared.***

# 3. Recording a Song is like building a house

Before you even get to work on the house, you spend hours designing and planning. This is the **Pre-Production Phase**. Finally, you are ready to bring a construction crew to your site of choice‚Ä¶ This is your arrival at the Studio. You put down the foundations first, within the context of the greater plan of the house. This is why drums and bass are the first to record, within the context of a scratch guitar or melody track. Next, you put up walls and a roof, essentially closing off the creative box in which you will work. This is the main identifying characteristic of the song (or house), such as lead melodies and vocals, or lead guitar. From there, you add finishing touches ‚Äî nice railings on the stairs, windows, drywall, insulation, and paint. These are finer details that reinforce the greater creative goal of the song, such as vocal harmonies, horn lines, solo sections, time-based effects, percussion, and texture.

### From my experience, I like to organize my **Recording Process** like this:

1. **Drums + Bass**
2. **Pad** (Rhythm Guitar + Keys) ‚Äî OR
3. **Melody** (Vocals, guitar, keys, whichever instrument is playing the melody)
4. **Harmony** (Horn section, backing vocals, etc)
5. **Texture** (ambience, percussion, overdubs)

And then of course at any time, any and all of these elements can be re-recorded (*exception here:* ***drums***), edited, moved around, spliced, played backwards, etc.

# 4. You can always add reverb and delay, but it is impossible to get rid of.

Most likely, your mix engineer will add reverb and delay properly. However, some artists are adamant that they know best:

### Scenario 1:

Let‚Äôs say you are in a Dream Pop band that has vocals running through a highly saturated vocal effects pedal. Your singer absolutely nails the take of the chorus, except for one thing: the singer accidentally smacks the microphone with their hand because of their \*sick dance moves\*. If you are only recording the vocal signal **wet** (*with effects*) as opposed to **dry** (*without effects*), not only are you recording the physical smack of the microphone, but you also are recording the 2 seconds of reverb that comes after. If you recorded Dry, you can easily edit out the hit and saturate the dry vocals with effects in Post. But if you recorded Wet, this becomes a brutal challenge for even the best engineer.

Mixing Engineers agree that it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove any amount of reverb or delay on a recorded instrument. Which is why we record dry signals and send the performer a wet signal in their monitor mixes. We make separate tracks for important, time-based effects like reverb and delay, and give those effects their own adjustable levels and parameters for real-time monitoring without affecting the integrity of the dry vocal track.

### Scenario 2:

You are the keyboard player of an indie rock band and you are playing a Rhodes. The built in tape delay on your Korg SV1 Keyboard is pretty great! So, you slap it on. Turns out, your delay timing is too long and too prominent in the context of the mix. Unfortunately, in this scenario there is nothing the engineer can do to fix that. ***With any and all time-based effects, you want to start small and build big, or use none at all***. You can always re-amp the clean signal or re-record the instrument with effects to taste.

# 5. Re-amp your guitars for the perfect tone

### Scenario 3:

You are in a Heavy Metal Band. Your guitar player take a 4 bar solo before the Pre-Chorus Breakdown. The amount of Gain and Distortion on this solo must be absolutely Perfect ‚Äî and while your effects may be incredibly dialed in to your ear, the Engineer always has a different perspective. So the Engineer will split the recording process into two parts:

**Re-Amping** is a non-destructive process of recording a clean tone (usually through a DI box straight from the Guitar) and then re-recording that clean signal into a guitar amp & Pedal effects separately over top of the song at a later time. This gives the band and Engineer the opportunity to fine-tune the gain, distortion, compression and any other effects to perfection without compromising the initial take.

[DI Box](https://i.imgur.com/Fmr88Jt.jpg)

Many engineers split the initial guitar tone and record both a **wet** & **dry** signal, especially in genres of heavily affected guitars (*like Metal, Rock and Roll, Pop, & Psychedelic Rock*). All musicians hold a bias towards the sound of their instrument as it appears to them *while they play*. Which is why when a guitarist hears their own wet take played side by side in context of the full mix, they many times choose the engineer‚Äôs.

# 6. Understand the Concept of the ‚ÄúMix Space‚Äù

1. ***Kick Drum*** ‚Äî center bottom
2. ***Snare*** ‚Äî lower center, left side
3. ***Cymbals*** ‚Äî Shimmering over top, spread wide
4. ***Pad*** ‚Äî fills in the stereo image
5. ***Lead melody*** ‚Äî loud and proud, center center
6. ***Rhythm guitar*** ‚Äî center, panned appropriately
7. ***Bass*** ‚Äî sandwiched between the Kick Drum Low and High

[Blues Band Mix Space ‚Äî Globe Institute of Recording & Production](https://i.imgur.com/QoSfpm0.jpg)

# 7. Make a recording schedule

What days do we do this? What days do we do that? Making a schedule allows you to keep track of your timeline and your budget!

It also helps to keep the recording engineer prepared. Here‚Äôs an example:

1. Wednesday = Load In, Set up
2. Thursday = Drums, Bass, Rhythm Section
3. Friday = Vocals, Melody
4. Saturday = Solo Sections, Re-Amping
5. Sunday = Textures, ambience, transitions, finishing touches

# 8. Agree on who wrote the song.

This is important for two reasons ‚Äî 1. Publishing rights (who takes credit and royalties for the intellectual property of the songwriting) and 2. Who has final say on any creative and technical decisions in the studio, on that song. Knowing who wrote the song will help the Engineer appropriately direct questions and concerns in a 1 on 1 style, instead of towards the whole band (which can lead to time-consuming debate.) This is not a huge deal, but I personally like to be aware of the creative dynamic of whose input is more valuable than others. I‚Äôm really only adding this because part of being a recording engineer is working within the dynamic of a group of creative individuals, and you don‚Äôt want to accidentally disturb it. And I‚Äôve seen some arguments for sure‚Ä¶ moving on.

# 9. No family members or friends while tracking

Please leave your parents and siblings at home. I generally welcome significant others (*because spouses/partners of professional musicians ‚Äúget it‚Äù*) but if your companions in the studio are distracting an engineer while they are working (*or worse, distracting the musician while you are working*), the Engineer might ask them to leave‚Ä¶. its not vacation time for your Engineer. Its ***get-work-done-time***.

# 10 Leave the Drama (and the drugs) at the Door

As a general rule, keep your distractions away from the Engineer. Recording is a very stressful and methodical task. If you‚Äôve got a joint, take it outside. If you‚Äôve got beef with a band mate‚Ä¶

[Yeah, thats gonna be a no from me, dawg](https://i.imgur.com/7ZF9HxL.png)

# 11. Don‚Äôt steal our Gaff tape, that stuff is expensive.

\*guilty\*

# 12. Most performance-related flaws can be fixed in post

Miss a note on the solo? **Edit it in post.** Vocalist didn‚Äôt deliver that line quite right? **Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs 12 other takes**. Not enough Reverb? **I Give it the ole‚Äô Re-Amp treatment.** Kick drum is off beat? **Copy, Paste, baby!** Efficiency is the name of the game in the recording process.

*(also, click* [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrXfK9Osmvs) *if you don't understand the Troggs reference below.... GOLD)*

[The Troggs](https://i.imgur.com/wLu0tiv.jpg)

# 13. However, two things must be addressed immediately: Time and Pitch

This is an objective issue that can foil the recording process. If your engineer tells you that you are either: **Rushing/Dragging** or **Out of Tune**, be cognizant that this small flaw can jeopardize the track later in the Recording Process (when *you add elements like harmony, melody, and texture*).

Which leads nicely into the next tip:

# 14. Tune your instruments in between takes

Please bring a tuner to the session. In general, you should be ultra-aware of your tempo (*if you are a member of the rhythm section*) and your tuning/intonation (*if you are a member of the melody section*).

# 15. Do some exercise/stretches in between takes

This is really important ‚Äî Exercising in between takes can significantly increase everyone‚Äôs mood and energy going back into the studio. You can actually hear the difference in the takes. Not to mention it can help relieve all that stress and any pent up aggression you have towards your band mates. Not only is exercise good for not having a heart attack when you are 50, it‚Äôll actually make the recording process much smoother and make the takes themselves better (*in my opinion*).

[Relevant BoJack is Relevant](https://i.imgur.com/JEKZZed.png)

# 16. Show up prepared‚Ä¶ to wait

1. 75% of your time will be spent sitting and waiting, or listening to your band mates record, so bring something to keep you occupied but that won‚Äôt take you out of the zone. I recommend a video game that you love but that is also something that you can put down in an instant and that you aren‚Äôt really invested in. Something simple, like Mario Kart or Super Smash Brothers, or even a Pok√©mon game.
2. If you want to stay in a creative vibe, I recommend bringing something to draw or doodle with. Put on some headphones and go dance outside. (We have a Rubix cube that sees a lot of love)
3. The most important thing is not to bring something that will remove you from the mindset of the studio environment. I certainly do not recommend bringing your day job! I‚Äôve heard many times: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just bring my computer and knock out some emails for my Marketing job while I wait for everyone to finish tracking‚Äù. This is a bad idea ‚Äî it will remove you from the headspace that you, the creative artist, need to be in to make the most out of your time and your engineer‚Äôs time. Unless it is related to the Band (*ordering merchandise, responding to Promoters, confirming show details*, *etc*), I would leave it at home.

# 17. Beware of Burrito-itis

Pretty self-explanatory.

# 18. Hot tea makes a good coffee substitute for long recording sessions, but water is even better.

Staying Hydrated is super important, it‚Äôll keep you focused for the longer sessions, not to mention being hydrated is just awesome in general. Also, make sure your vocalist knows about **Throat Coat**, that stuff is the mamma-jammas

[Throat Coat](https://i.imgur.com/lhtmVV0.jpg)

# 19. The engineer is not your enemy

The Recording Engineer has one job: ***Be the bridge that transfers the highest quality version of your music into the physical world***. This manifests itself differently from producer to producer‚Ä¶ some engineers are technical producers and some engineers are people producers. It‚Äôs a balance of therapy and tough love, tech savvy & emotional capacity, having the mental fortitude to keep going and the discipline to know when you‚Äôve gone far enough. The bottom line ‚Äî The Engineer is just doing what they believe is the best thing for the final product. So if your engineer delivers constructive criticism to you, such as ‚Äú*That take was a decent take, but I can hear the energy level dropping a bit. Let‚Äôs take 15 and regroup*‚Äù‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt take it personally.

# 20. Bring your A-Game

Aside from the mental discipline needed for an efficient and productive studio session, I argue that every musician should take their instrument to the shop to get ‚Äútuned-up‚Äù before you begin your session.

1. **Guitarists**: a tune-up can address problems such as: Buzzing frets, Intonation problems, and Electrical noise, and will usually set you up with a set of fresh strings
2. **Vocalists**: Don‚Äôt go partying the night before and lose your voice plz & thx ‚Äî signed, everyone.
3. **Drummers**: Put on new heads before the session and tune your drums every couple hours. Double check the chains on your kick and hi-hat pedals.
4. **Producers**: Check that all your cables, sound cards, interfaces, controllers and adapters are working before coming into the studio. We may not have what you need!
5. **Everyone else**: Don‚Äôt make fun of the drummer for tuning their kit, just be proud that they showed up at all (kidding :P)

# 21. The #1 goal should be capturing the energy of the performance

There is an indescribable rush of emotion and power that arises from well-performed and recorded music. It‚Äôs like tasting your mom‚Äôs signature dish, or watching a group of fighter jets dance in the skies. Where just for a moment, you forget about all the technical barriers and frustrations and troubleshooting‚Ä¶ you forget to monitor the faders on your console or the dB levels on your mic pre-amps‚Ä¶ and you sit back in awe at the musical masterpiece crafted in front of you. And you look down at your computer screen and watch with a smile as that energy is grasped from the ephemeral and poured like concrete into your hard drive. It‚Äôs the absolute best part about being an engineer ‚Äî Capturing the joy and energy and‚Ä¶ well, the magic.

# 22. Don‚Äôt suck, Have fun

I‚Äôm gonna get a tattoo of this one day.

Thanks for reading :)

405,I am 16 years old. Am i allowed to play in bars?,55,musicians,151,"I have a band with some friends and we would like to spend a part of summer playing in bars and/or restaurants, but dont know the legality of entering bars if we are not customers. If it helps, i live in Canada. Any help is appreciated :)"
406,What band/artist has the worst fanbase (any genre),60,musicians,393,
407,Trying to start a band is harder than I expected.,58,musicians,53,"Currently a music production student. We have two studios and a great rehearsal room. I found a guitar player (willing to just play bass and sing instead of guitar for now) because a 3-piece is easier to manage from the get-go. A drummer is hard to find though. The cool thing is the rehearsal room has great acoustics AND amps and a drum set and pianos already, which rocks. We have a great performance hall for recitals as well. I posted a flyer looking for a drummer (must be a student at the college)

This will probably take some time, but I am just itching to perform. I may start just playing my acoustic outside in the courtyard by myself once the weather gets better because I love playing and singing in front of people. Maybe that's a good way to find other musicians as well."
408,Shorts on stage? Yay or Nay?,57,musicians,441,"Just got a comment ‚Äúput some pants on‚Äù üòÇ but it was like 90+ degrees out! Personally, I will sacrifice fashion for comfort but I understand that this is sacrilegious to some‚Ä¶ what do you think?

PS. buy a stage fan, I learned that too late"
409,Who are these two they sound really interesting,58,musicians,31,
410,Is it ever OK to play a gig for free?,57,musicians,166,"I am a student at a university (not studying music), and accepted a free gig. It's for a student event that goes to charity, but a lot of musicians around me were against the idea, saying that you should never do a gig for free. To me I see no issue since I'm not a professional musician, and they probably couldn't afford a band, and it's going to charity? All the players in the band play to a decent level, but I wouldn't put it to professional standard."
411,Overwhelmed and Depressed.,56,musicians,75,"Hello Everyone! I'll try to keep this as short as possible, I'm 30 years old, I've been playing bass since i was 15, i worked hard to get my name out there, and now I'm in a semi professional touring band, and usually get my Spring/Summer/Fall booked up with cover gigs and original band gigs (when not touring) without even trying. Everyone in my life tells me that I'm doing great, and that i should be proud of myself, but I can't help but feel like the biggest failure, I'm so unbelievably disappointed in myself for not being so much further along at my age, and I'm constantly overwhelmed by the realizations of how much more work I had to (and still have to) put in to feel fulfilled. My fear, intimidation, realizations of reality, and awareness of my emotional/work limits has affected me to a crippling degree, and I've felt this way for years. I have no idea how to get over this. Thanks for reading! Hope you're all having a great week."
412,Do you feel like an 'imposter' when it comes to being a musician?,55,musicians,58,"Who struggles with feeling like an imposter with being a musician, songwriter, producer, or any other music based craft?

Are you hesitant to call yourself one of these titles?

I'm keen to start a discussion on this and see how other people feel about this.

Please leave a comment below if you struggle with imposter syndrome."
413,Delusional lead singer?,57,musicians,51,We started a band 7 months ago. We have 10 songs. The lead singer is still learning how to sing as he is flat half the time. Yet the singer keeps talking about touring Europe and being a rockstar yet he can‚Äôt sing. Am I being a downer or is he just overly delusional?
414,I‚Äôve been a terrible band member.,58,musicians,43,"I lost my position on drums at my band‚Äôs next gig. And I deserved it. At the last gig, I fucked up real bad and then got too drunk to handle myself at load out. Then I haven‚Äôt studied up on new songs, and I‚Äôve just been distracted and hard to schedule because of life and work. I feel embarrassed about all of this. I‚Äôve never had this problem. I‚Äôm usually on top of stuff but I‚Äôm lacking right now. Embarrassed doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe how terribly I fucked up."

417,Alegria flamenco,60,musicians,16,
418,Pro Tip: I am 45 and have made my living as a musician forever. Always load out your own gear. Politely decline help. Others screw up your system and you will lose gear.,58,musicians,15,I lost 3 brand new SM58s Saturday because I broke this rule. 
420,How moody is the average musician?,56,musicians,115,"I've felt the wrath before of producers/musician just going ham on me in casual settings when it comes to project criticisms.  Usually this ends with ""I thought you were going to be very defensive, because a lot of people say they're special but don't put the work in.""  And you just think...man, stuff built up and got put on me.

Then you hear SO much about band politics.  I wonder if it's cherrypicking, and most bands and musicians get along perfectly fine.  But I guess the reality is that musicians aren't always easy to find, so you take what you get, and sometimes it's a crabby guitarist."
421,Question for musicians from a neighbor,56,musicians,95,"I have lived in a city for the last 10 years, many of which have been spent sharing walls with neighbors in bands, neighbors who practice instruments, etc. Everyone has a right to make sound in their living space as long as it's reasonable. It's never bothered me, and I generally like listening to people have a good time!

After living in my current place for a few years, a professional classical guitarist moved downstairs. He plays guitar very loudly for up to 6-8 hours (on and off) a day. He is quite successful in his field, as I can tell from his socials (60k followers, regular engagement, regularly traveling the world to perform). 

Unfortunately, it's driving me crazy. I understand that he needs to practice, and I am glad he has a space to do it. But given that it's a residential area where he knows he shares walls on all sides, and he's a successful musician, I'm very surprised that he doesn't have a studio or place to practice that is less disruptive to his neighbors. It's been a few years now, and I was hoping that I would get used to it, but I just can't. I often have to leave the house at odd hours to walk around just to get some silence. He recently went on vacation and I immediately felt a massive sense of relief and comfort in my own home again. Now that he's back, I am more on edge than ever.

My question to the musicians is this: Is this the norm? I know that musicians are not a monolith, but what is your expected behavior of a musician in this situation? How common is it for a solo artist to have studio space?"
422,"Honest question: Would you still make, record and/or perform music if you didn't get paid?",58,musicians,198,"A recent thread here got me wondering. Do you make music primarily as a way to generate income? As in, if there was NO chance of you ever making ANY money whatsoever, would you still be motivated enough to create, record and perform? If so, how would your approach change if at all?"
423,My band just released our first single! Medical Jargon by Fold Paper is out everywhere,58,musicians,12,
424,My bf is a musician - what gift would you be ecstatic to receive as a musician?,57,musicians,80,"I‚Äôm looking for Christmas gifts and struggling so wondering if I can ask this here! 
Anything other than equipment bc he‚Äôs already got all that and is very specific and picky. He plays guitar and piano and also writes music & lyrics. 

Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"
425,Moved to Montana! Enjoying the new setupüé∂,56,musicians,12,
426,Do any of my fellow multi-instrumentalist peeps get overwhelmed by what instrument they think they should be focusing on? Sometimes leading to doing nothing at all?,59,musicians,19,It's so frustrating. Any suggestions on handling this dilemma?
427,"I recently bought a looper pedal, and an acoustic pickup. For any guitarists out there wondering, here‚Äôs your sign!",57,musicians,5,
428,Does anyone else live in fear of being injured in a way that will prevent you from playing your instrument?,57,musicians,30,Just a split second lapse in focus while dicing an onion and bye bye finger. Someone could punch me in the face and swell up my cheeks and lips to the point where I can‚Äôt make a sound or control my embouchure. I could develop focal dystonia or arthritis from all the repetition practicing demands. Something could happen at any time and it honestly mortifies me.
430,Help dealing with a patronizing band member,57,musicians,100,"I am currently in a band that has no real goals outside of playing at local bars.  It's totally fine.  I am a rhythm guitarist for the group, while my band member is the lead guitarist as well as the lead singer.  He's very difficult to work with.  He won't listen to my ideas, as well as the others.  He comes up with the setlists himself and doesn't ask for our input.  And above all else, he is very condescending whenever we provide an audio clip of us playing or practicing in person.  Always says things like ""oh, that's good bud.  A little slower than the original but not bad.""  I also asked if I could play a few piano songs on my keyboard, showed him a song.  The band loved it, and thought it was a great idea.  He shut it down because ""nobody cares about piano"".  Should I just leave the band if I'm not enjoying it?"
431,"Anyone else hate playing live? Those of you that enjoy it, why? ",53,musicians,221,"I guess I‚Äôm trying to figure out why other musicians enjoy playing their music live. What are the honest reasons that performing gives you fulfillment. I‚Äôm newer to recording music and have found a ton of catharsis and enjoyment in recording and producing my own music, as well as collaborations (via file sharing). I‚Äôm in a group with 3 men and none of them seem to mind playing out and they even enjoy it. I have extreme social anxiety, and I am a working wife and mom of 2 young kids and while we don‚Äôt play out often, it‚Äôs such a drag for me to cut my work schedule, find a sitter, lugging gear around, be out late, etc‚Ä¶on top of hating performing and only being comfortable in my studio alone with my laptop. I‚Äôm about to throw in the towel and tell them I don‚Äôt want to do any more live shows (we‚Äôve only done 3 and have a 4th coming up next week). But I don‚Äôt want to be a party crasher and basically kill our live presence since I‚Äôm a bit of the main feature in our band by contributing vocals and multiple instruments and providing the structure of our set. Please tell me some positives you get from it. Bonus is you‚Äôre a mom too:)"
432,About to have my first gig‚Ä¶. Feeling like I want to quit and I‚Äôm a fraud‚Ä¶.,53,musicians,123,"I have my first live gig next week‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm a producer, song writer and ‚Äúsinger‚Äù (I say with quotes cuz I edit my vocals so much cuz I‚Äôm actually terrible)

I‚Äôm practicing and feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to be on stage, asking for peoples attention. My backing vocals are loud af and I have so many plug ins on my vocals to help me sound okey.
I‚Äôm miming playing some of the samples cuz I can‚Äôt get it in time.

I feel like I‚Äôm a fake and I‚Äôll get caught out. I thought this is what I wanted but now I‚Äôm thinkin I should just keep producing in my room. I‚Äôm not even very good at production! 

Help üòî

EDIT- thank you all for the incredible advice and support!!! 

Follow up question- thoughts on my miming playing some of the bits, samples ect? I‚Äôm super insecure about this cuz it makes me feel super fake but I just have too many things to focus and practice to get these things right‚Ä¶ opinions? "

435,"Are you insulted if your band members refer to you as ""my drummer""/""my guitarist""?",54,musicians,107,"Yesterday, I came across a post on Craigslist (of all places) that essentially said ""only a narcissist would refer to somebody as 'my drummer'"" and that Keith Moon once punched Pete Townshend for referring to him as ""my drummer"".  I always thought that sounded inclusive rather than insulting... what do you all think?"
436,Female musicians of reddit: Does this happen to you often?,53,musicians,66,"Two of my bandmates have developed a crush on me and it makes things complicated.  
I've been in a band for about 2 years now and the experience has been.... well, it has been an experience.  
In that time, some problems came up. We are 4 people. Me, a female and three guys.  
After a year or so one of them started to have a pretty bad crush on me and now the other one confessed to me that he was ""interested"" in me and now accuses me of having played with him just because I was nice to him...  


Now my question to all female musicians is: Has that happend to you? Does it happen often, that a guy develops a crush on a female bandmate? What are your experiences with this sort of thing? Do you have some advice for me?

As soon as I get there and set foot inside the place the feeling dissipates, and I _know_ the feeling will dissipate, but I spend the whole day dreading it anyway.  I do enjoy performing (I sure ain't doing it for the money), but I can't shake that miserable feeling of sickness for the day leading up to it."
446,Is it weird to have a music stand with lyrics in front of you during a gig?,54,musicians,223,"My parents and I started a band together, and we have quite a few songs in our repertoire. My mom and I have a hard time memorizing all the lyrics to all of these songs, so we both have music stands with lyrics in front of us while performing.

I'm worried that having this is going to effect the legitimacy of our musicianship in the eyes of the venues that we're going to. Is this a normal thing for cover bands?"
447,Don't give up music if you can help it,54,musicians,39,"I have cut myself off from music and I regret it. The story is long and exhausting. I won't tell it. I am posting only to say this:

Music is medicine. It can be used to treat diseases of the mind. If it has ever brought you a feeling of peace, relief, or well-being, it is because you needed medicine and got it. 

Some of us, through accident of birth or tragedy of circumstance, have great difficulty managing the internal experiences of being human that the majority of people are able to take for granted. We gravitate toward music because it is an effective medicine for our ailments. 

Practicing music changes you. It alters the way your mind processes daily experience. The effects are cumulative and overwhelmingly positive. Given time, dedication, and effort, the relationship a person can make with music is as enriching and life-affirming as one with a beloved person. Time makes this bond stronger, and the galvanizing effects on the mind increase. 

The bond can be broken. A diseased mind is a formidable thing, and depression wants to live. Depression recognizes music as a threat to its existence, and will conspire to come between you. 

I'm trying to find my point. I think it's that people need to recognize that for the legions of people who suffer from one mental illness or another, music and musicianship aren't necessarily hobbies. It isn't like playing a video game or sailing a boat (wonderful activities that I also love and respect). For some of us, music is an essential medicine. Neglecting our treatments can be disasterous. 

My depression simply outsmarted me. It convinced me that I was wasting my time with music. That my children would be better served by a couple of trips to the ice cream store than having a father who owns an instrument. So I sold it. I sold it all. Everything I valued that no one else would miss. Didn't even count the money I got for it. This was a symbolic but effective ritual of bond breaking. It was such a pointless, hurtful, self destructive act that I walked away from it feeling like a different person entirely. 

I do not know, recognize, or like this new person. He isn't a musician. I don't what he is, just that he has no music in him. The implications of this disturb me greatly. 

Hold on to your music. Doubts and frustrations are normal, but if you need your music to live, that is a real thing and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The increased emotional functionality that comes with the stimulation of a brain by music is as real, studied, and scientifically understood as that of antidepressants. Cutting oneself off from music can be as dangerous as going cold turkey on an antidepressant. I fucked around and I found out. Don't fuck around because it's not worth finding out. "
448,My lifelong dream is to be a musician but people tell me to give up,55,musicians,128,"It's very saddening to be discouraged from doing what feels right. Especially when your family is telling you not to do it. It's hard to keep my spirits up sometimes, how can I keep myself encouraged?"
449,Old guy rant about current trends,55,musicians,53,"I hate the memetization of music.

460,Ex-Bandmates issues with me keeping my songs,54,musicians,144,"Kinda just looking for some advice or if someone has gone through this before.

I‚Äôll try to keep this relatively short, I was in a band for around 4 years as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. In that time I had written a few songs for the band, like most of the lyrics, the guitar/vocal melody and structure of the whole song. 

Due to some very persistent creative differences and character conflicts, I decided to leave the band a few months ago, and before I did I made sure to ask each member if they were cool with me taking my songs and only what I wrote for them (so no taking their parts or anything) and they all said they were fine with it. Now I‚Äôm solo, and the 3 of them formed a new band.

Cut to now, I just finished recording my version of one of the songs we had worked on, different parts but it still kept the og Weezer/Midwest emo vibe I originally went for, and I hear from my ex lead guitarist that they are very unhappy that I am still using the songs. So I message them with a file of the mix, and after a few hours they finally tell me that they feel like all their stuff has been erased, notably, my ex drummer told me to just forget my songs and move on because they‚Äôre too intertwined, even if not the same exact parts. 

So that‚Äôs the impasse; When I wrote the songs I didn‚Äôt just intend to play them for a while and then forget they exist. If my ex rhythm guitarist never told me, I would‚Äôve just assumed they were still fine. They know that I have full proof that the songs are mine, but I straight up just don‚Äôt know what to do, anybody ever had a similar situation?

466,22 Lessons I learned in the Recording Studio...,55,musicians,9,">**Will Clarke**, owner of **Prana Recording Studio** Agency in Atlanta, GA has contributed to this article[.](https://imgur.com/veZ7YTY)

# 1. Practice your songs to a click

Unless you are recording a LIVE album, practicing and your music to a metronome is essential for the studio environment. Drum takes that are ‚Äúon-the-grid‚Äù makes overdubbing or any sort of correction in **Post-Production** incredibly easy. I know many engineers that will not record without a click simply to avoid the headache. If your musical group has music (*or a drummer*) that fluctuates between tempos, you need to rehearse the music to per-determined **BPM** before showing up to your session.

# 2. Show up Prepared

My opinion is: A great studio session is one that runs quickly and efficiently. If you and your band mates are pressured into last minute songwriting issues or troubleshooting (*such as vocal delivery, guitar melody, or rhythm section misalignment*), it can be a real strain on the recording process.

If you are looking to become a session musician, remember this saying: ***You might not be the best player in the room, but you can certainly be the most prepared.***

# 3. Take Your Time

The **Recording Process** is broken down into 3 parts:

## Pre-Production:

Before you even arrive at the studio, you are going to spend hours designing and planning your session. This is the **Pre-Production Phase**.  This process includes finding and communicating with your engineer about the expectations of the record and your budget. Some studios will want to do a day of Pre-Production in the studio to make sure that when it‚Äôs time to record final takes, every detail is hashed out. During this time you can put down the foundations of the song and provide context for the greater plan of the song. Foundational elements include final BPM, rhythms, instrumentation, and structure, as well as lyrics, chorus melody, lead lines, etc

## Recording

-  ***Scratch Tracks*** (guitar, vocals, melody, piano, etc)
- ***Drums + Final***
- ***Lead Instruments*** (Vocals, guitar, keys, whichever instrument is playing the melody)
- ***Pads*** (Rhythm Guitar + Keys)
- ***Harmony*** (Horn section, backing vocals, etc)
- ***Texture*** (ambiance, percussion, overdubs, Solos)

Now that the foundation is established, it is time to start building some walls! Drums and Bass will be the first 2 instruments to record final takes. The reason for this is that every other instrument needs to record along with the drums for a cohesive recording. Bass will record next to establish structure, changes, and rhythm. 

Now that these two rhythmic elements have been finalized, the rest can flow in accordance with the needs of the session and the genre. Hip hop groups would go ahead and record final takes for verses and choruses, while rock bands may elect to do guitars at this stage. In all cases, the next step is to record the main identifying characteristic of the song. After that, you add finishing touches ‚Äî finer details that reinforce the greater creative goal of the song, such as vocal harmonies, horn lines, solo sections, time-based effects, percussion, and texture.

## Production

- **Time Based inserts** (Reverb & Delay) 
- **Gain Based Inserts** (Drive, Saturation, Compression) 
- **EQ**
- **Mixing** (Panning, Fade In/Outs, levelling, etc)

The production stage is often referred to as the mixing stage. Many engineers do not want the artist in the same room as them while they do the majority of the mixing as it is a tedious and focus intensive process. However, you will have many opportunities to provide detailed feedback on the mixes during the ‚ÄúRevisions‚Äù process. Make sure you have communicated your expectations about the mixing with your engineer and your budget before you et started in the studio!

If you have the budget, or you are working with a dedicated producer on the song, you may have the freedom to do what I call creative mixing. Creative Mixing is taking a more intensive, creative approach to the production process. It can push your track to the next level, however it is very time consuming. Creative Mix techniques include: Delay throws, risers, vocal effects, practical effects, automated effects, drum triggers, amp simulation, and so, so much more. Just make sure you work with your engineer and give them a heads up that you want to do creative mixing because it really does take a ton of time‚Ä¶ speaking of mixing:

# 4. No time-based effects while recording!

You can always add reverb and delay, but it is impossible to get rid of when recorded. Most likely, your mix engineer will add an amount of reverb and delay appropriate for your personal mixes while **tracking** (recording) to assist the performance. However, some artists are adamant that they know best and go into the studio with the intention of breaking this rule. Let's look at some scenarios:

### Scenario 1:

Let‚Äôs say you are in a Dream Pop band that has vocals running through a highly saturated vocal effects pedal. Your singer nails a take of the chorus, except for one thing: they accidentally smack the microphone with their hand because of their \*sick dance moves\*. If you are only recording the vocal signal **wet** (*with effects*) as opposed to **dry** (*without effects*), not only are you recording the physical smack of the microphone, but you also are recording the 2 seconds of reverb that comes after. If you recorded Dry, you can easily edit out the hit and saturate the dry vocals with effects in Post. But if you recorded Wet, this becomes a brutal challenge for even the best engineer.

Mixing Engineers agree that it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove any amount of reverb or delay on a recorded instrument. Which is why we record dry signals and send the performer a wet signal in their monitor mixes. We make separate tracks for important, time-based effects like reverb and delay, and give those effects their own adjustable levels and parameters for real-time monitoring without affecting the integrity of the dry vocal track.

### Scenario 2:

You are the keyboard player of an indie rock band and you are playing Rhodes. The built-in tape delay on your Korg SV1 Keyboard is pretty great! So, you slap it on. Turns out, your delay timing is too long and too prominent in the context of the mix. Everytime you play a chord, your delay triggers half a second too late. It is unsettling and it throws off the rhythm section for the entire mix. Unfortunately, in this scenario there is nothing the engineer can do to fix that because the tape delay is recorded on the main signal. 

***With any and all time-based effects, you want to start small and build big, or use none at all***. You can always re-amp the clean signal or re-record the instrument with effects to taste:

# 5. Find your perfect Tone in Post-Production

### Scenario 3:

You are in a Heavy Metal Band. Your guitar player take a 4 bar solo before the Pre-Chorus Breakdown. The amount of Gain and Distortion on this solo must be absolutely Perfect ‚Äî and while your effects may be dialed in to your ear, the Engineer always has a different perspective. So the Engineer will split the recording process into two parts:

**Re-Amping** is a non-destructive process of recording a clean tone (usually through a DI box straight from the Guitar) and then re-recording that clean signal into a guitar amp & Pedal effects separately over top of the song at a later time. This gives the band and Engineer the opportunity to fine-tune the gain, distortion, compression and any other effects to perfection without compromising the initial take.

[DI Box](https://i.imgur.com/Fmr88Jt.jpg)

Many engineers split the initial guitar tone and record both a **wet** & **dry** signal, especially in genres of heavily affected guitars (*like Metal, Rock and Roll, Pop, & Psychedelic Rock*). All musicians hold a bias towards the sound of their instrument as it appears to them *while they play*. Which is why when a guitarist hears their own wet take played side by side in context of the full mix, they many times choose the engineer‚Äôs.

# 6. Understand your position within the ‚ÄúMix Space‚Äù

For many people, the first time hearing playback of yourself or your music on dedicated studio speakers in a sound-treated room is a shock. For our entire lives, we perceive music through ‚Äúcolored‚Äù stereo systems, as most consumer brand stereos adjust the audio that passes through them. Car Speakers, home stereos, Bose and JBL battery powered speakers, listening to music on your phone, through apple air pods, or Beats by Dre. The sonic characteristics are being changed and warped as the audio runs through each of these systems. Dedicated studio speakers, however, are designed to be *flat*, which means they add extra no characteristics to the audio source while amplifying it. The sound of studio speakers, or monitors as they are called (because they allow an engineer to *‚Äúmonitor‚Äù* the audio in real time), can be off-putting or even described as harsh. The ears of the average listener are not accustomed to hearing the exposed and highly detailed audio of professional studio monitors. Our ears enjoy the warm and smooth sounds of a Bose or a JBL system, but for an engineer it is absolutely critical to working with the most accurate representation of the recorded audio, so that later in the mixing and production process of your music it will better translate into those other systems. 

Audio is energy in the form of sound waves. The **Mix Space** is a representation of how that audio (energy) occupies a room. It can be represented in a 2-D graph ( [like this one](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0970/0050/files/Seperation_In_The_Mix.jpg?v=1526997772) ) which helps us to understand the role of each instrument within a mix. 

The mix space is based on a few different parameters: Panning (Left, Center, Right), EQ (frequency spectrum, or ""height"" in a 2D representation), & Volume (gain based inserts, levels, depth). So if were to refer to an instrument (such as the kick), I would refer to that as being ""low"" on the frequency spectrum, and centered in the mix space (no pan)


Here are some examples of how different instruments sit in the mix:

1. ***Kick Drum*** ‚Äî center bottom
2. ***Snare*** ‚Äî lower center, left side
3. ***Cymbals*** ‚Äî Shimmering over top, spread wide
4. ***Pad*** ‚Äî fills in the stereo image
5. ***Lead melody*** ‚Äî loud and proud, center center
6. ***Rhythm guitar*** ‚Äî center, panned appropriately
7. ***Bass*** ‚Äî sandwiched between the Kick Drum Low and High

Here is another graphic visualizer of a Mix Space. Hopefully this will help you make creative decisions about your music and your own parts by having a more cohesive understanding of the elements of a final mix.

# 7. Make a recording schedule

What days do we do this? What days do we do that? Making a schedule allows you to keep track of your timeline and your budget!

It also helps to keep the recording engineer prepared. Here‚Äôs an example:

- Monday = Pre-Production Day 1
- Tuesday = Pre-Production Day 2
- Wednesday = Load In, Set up
- Thursday = Drums, Bass, Rhythm Section
- Friday = Vocals, Melody
- Saturday = Solo Sections, Re-Amping
- Sunday = Textures, ambience, transitions, finishing touches

# 8. Agree on who wrote the song.

This is important for two reasons ‚Äî 1. Publishing rights (who takes credit and royalties for the intellectual property of the songwriting) and 2. Who has final say on any creative and technical decisions in the studio, on that song. Knowing who wrote the song will help the Engineer appropriately direct questions and concerns in a 1 on 1 style, instead of towards the whole band (which can lead to time-consuming debate.) This is not a huge deal, but I personally like to be aware of the creative dynamic of whose input is more valuable than others. I‚Äôm really only adding this because part of being a recording engineer is working within the dynamic of a group of creative individuals, and you don‚Äôt want to accidentally disturb it. And I‚Äôve seen some arguments for sure‚Ä¶ moving on.

# 9. No family members or friends while tracking

Please leave your parents and siblings at home. I generally welcome significant others (*because spouses/partners of professional musicians ‚Äúget it‚Äù*) but if your companions in the studio are distracting an engineer while they are working (*or worse, distracting the musician while you are working*), the Engineer might ask them to leave‚Ä¶. its not vacation time for your Engineer. Its ***get-work-done-time***.

# 10 Leave the Drama (and the drugs) at the Door

As a general rule, keep your distractions away from the Engineer. Recording is a very stressful and methodical task. If you‚Äôve got a joint, take it outside. If you‚Äôve got beef with a band mate‚Ä¶

[Yeah, thats gonna be a no from me, dawg](https://i.imgur.com/7ZF9HxL.png)

# 11. Don‚Äôt steal our Gaff tape, that stuff is expensive.

\*guilty\*

# 12. Most performance-related flaws can be fixed in post

Miss a note on the solo? **Edit it in post.** Vocalist didn‚Äôt deliver that line quite right? **Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs 12 other takes**. Not enough Reverb? **I Give it the ole‚Äô Re-Amp treatment.** Kick drum is off beat? **Copy, Paste, baby!** Efficiency is the name of the game in the recording process.

*(also, click* [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrXfK9Osmvs) *if you don't understand the Troggs reference below.... GOLD)*

[The Troggs](https://i.imgur.com/wLu0tiv.jpg)

# 13. However, two things must be addressed immediately: Time and Pitch

This is an objective issue that can foil the recording process. If your engineer tells you that you are either: **Rushing/Dragging** or **Out of Tune**, be cognizant that this small flaw can jeopardize the track later in the Recording Process (when *you add elements like harmony, melody, and texture*).

Which leads nicely into the next tip:

# 14. Tune your instruments in between takes

Please bring a tuner to the session. In general, you should be ultra-aware of your tempo (*if you are a member of the rhythm section*) and your tuning/intonation (*if you are a member of the melody section*).

# 15. Do some exercise/stretches in between takes

This is really important ‚Äî Exercising in between takes can significantly increase everyone‚Äôs mood and energy going back into the studio. You can actually hear the difference in the takes. Not to mention it can help relieve all that stress and any pent up aggression you have towards your band mates. Not only is exercise good for not having a heart attack when you are 50, it‚Äôll actually make the recording process much smoother and make the takes themselves better (*in my opinion*).

[Relevant BoJack is Relevant](https://i.imgur.com/JEKZZed.png)

# 16. Show up prepared‚Ä¶ to wait

The majority of your time in the studio will be spent sitting and waiting, listening to your band mates record, or working through the mix with the engineer. I recommend bringing something to keep you occupied but that won‚Äôt take you out of the zone or take too much energy away from you. I recommend a video game that you love but that is also something that you can put down in an instant and that you aren‚Äôt really invested in. Something simple, like Mario Kart or Super Smash Brothers, or even a Pok√©mon game. If you want to stay in a creative vibe, I recommend bringing something to draw or doodle with. Put on some headphones and go dance outside. (We have a Rubix cube that sees a lot of love)

The most important thing is not to bring something that will remove you from the mindset of the studio environment. I certainly do not recommend bringing your day job! I‚Äôve heard many times: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just bring my computer and knock out some emails for my Marketing job while I wait for everyone to finish tracking‚Äù. This is a bad idea ‚Äî it will remove you from the headspace that you need to be in to make the most out of your engineer‚Äôs time. Unless it is related to the Band (and this could be any amount of managerial tasks such as *ordering merchandise, responding to Promoters, confirming show details*, *etc*), I would leave it at home.

# 17. Beware of Burrito-itis

Pretty self-explanatory.

# 18. Hot tea makes a good coffee substitute for long recording sessions, but water is even better.

Staying Hydrated is super important, it‚Äôll keep you focused for the longer sessions, not to mention being hydrated is just awesome in general. Also, make sure your vocalist knows about **Throat Coat**, that stuff is the mamma-jammas

[Throat Coat](https://i.imgur.com/lhtmVV0.jpg)

# 19. The engineer is not your enemy

The Recording Engineer has one job: ***Be the bridge that transfers the highest quality version of your music into the physical world***. This manifests itself differently from producer to producer‚Ä¶ some engineers are technical producers and some engineers are people producers. It‚Äôs a balance of therapy and tough love, tech savvy & emotional capacity, having the mental fortitude to keep going and the discipline to know when you‚Äôve gone far enough. The bottom line ‚Äî The Engineer is just doing what they believe is the best thing for the final product. So if your engineer delivers constructive criticism to you, such as ‚Äú*That take was a decent take, but I can hear the energy level dropping a bit. Let‚Äôs take 15 and regroup*‚Äù‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt take it personally.

# 20. Bring your A-Game

Aside from the mental discipline needed for an efficient and productive studio session, I argue that every musician should take their instrument to the shop to get ‚Äútuned-up‚Äù before you begin your session.

1. **Guitarists**: a tune-up can address problems such as: Buzzing frets, Intonation problems, and Electrical noise, and will usually set you up with a set of fresh strings
2. **Vocalists**: Don‚Äôt go partying the night before and lose your voice plz & thx ‚Äî signed, everyone.
3. **Drummers**: Put on new heads before the session and tune your drums every couple hours. Double check the chains on your kick and hi-hat pedals.
4. **Producers**: Check that all your cables, sound cards, interfaces, controllers and adapters are working before coming into the studio. We may not have what you need!
5. **Everyone else**: Don‚Äôt make fun of the drummer for tuning their kit, just be proud that they showed up at all (kidding :P)

# 21. The #1 goal should be capturing the energy of the performance

There is an indescribable rush of emotion and power that arises from well-performed and recorded music. It‚Äôs like tasting your mom‚Äôs signature dish, or watching a group of fighter jets dance in the skies. Where just for a moment, you forget about all the technical barriers and frustrations and troubleshooting‚Ä¶ you forget to monitor the faders on your console or the dB levels on your mic pre-amps‚Ä¶ and you sit back in awe at the musical masterpiece crafted in front of you. And you look down at your computer screen and watch with a smile as that energy is grasped from the ephemeral and poured like concrete into your hard drive. It‚Äôs the absolute best part about being an engineer ‚Äî Capturing the joy and energy and‚Ä¶ well, the magic.

# 22. Don‚Äôt suck, Have fun

I'm such a coward about it. I hate eyes on me in any setting. I can play well when I'm alone, but as soon as I have an audience I start screwing up when playing anything that's not simple. Even if I write something cool and tell my wife to come hear it I'll screw it up every single time once she is present, and then when she leaves I'll get it right again. I was in a few bands as a teen and luckily could play in front of the few friends we would occasionally bring to practices, but I was terrified to get on stage when the time came. I was gonna suck it up and deal with it of course because It would have been more embarrassing to tell my friends I was scared, but fortunately we never made it that far so I never had to.

I've recently been getting into singing more, and my buddy and I have been producing some songs with me doing vocals instead of guitar. I kind of dig it and I think I like the idea of singing. But there's even more expectation for a stage presence as a singer because now you're talking to the crowd and people are paying more attention to you, at least as a guitarist I could just hang off to the side and do my thing. We're not even a band, so there's no plan to play any shows anytime soon. But last night I went to a show, and idk it just seemed so easy.  All these casual people just got on stage, did their thing, had fun, and got offstage. I kept just feeling disappointed that I've let so much time go by and haven't just done it yet.

I'm hoping to hear some of your first show nerve stories and how it went / how you felt afterwards to hopefully help me realize I can do it. So let's hear them!"
498,Do you have a music pet peeve?,50,musicians,293,"Could be anything, even if it doesn't have a real reason. 

Mine is when people talk about ""making beats"". There's nothing wrong with it I guess, but even for EDM or rap music it just feels like there's more to it then just a ""beat"", even though I know that's not what they mean. 

My other is when people talk about how x genre is objectively bad, or worse ""isn't music""/""isn't real music"". Like just because you don't like it, and maybe it's not the most harmonically/rhythmically/etc interesting thing ever, that doesn't make it any less than whatever you make. Even worse when it's music in the charts, because clearly it's good if people are listening to it (even if you aren't). Just my too sense. And this is coming from someone who also doesn't enjoy much of the styles this typically happens to."
499,Has anyone lost their music mojo?,51,musicians,108,"I've wanted to be a musician since adolescence. Obviously few make it, and for me some of the simplest of opportunities became wasted for whatever reasons. Looking back, I see what went wrong or didn't happen, but there is no way a young me would've understood.

I'm a multi-interest guy; music, photography, programming as a passion. Over the past 5 or so years let's say, I lost interest in music. But I was able to replace it with photography and programming. Then photography died, and then programming. I think something happens when one turns 50. Like the realization that if I haven't found success be now, it isn't coming.

I would like to get the music back though. I have 20  years worth of mish-mash recorded material. I wouldn't even need to touch a guitar ever again and be able to release a few very cool songs. But I just don't have it in me any longer. Instead I sleep.

I think partially it's because the day job was about money, and the music was about girls (not that I pulled any). Now I'm too old for girls, so there is no point in carrying on."

It's all originals, written/recorded on pianos across the world, scored with found sounds into 3 continuous narratives (this is the 1st in a trilogy). Mostly solo, some Rhodes, some in bass/drums trio setup.

The project centers around the idea that music can transport us to places and experiences. So, if a song evokes any stories or memories or emotions for you, I would genuinely LOVE to know -- the live show features storytelling and there's always possibilities for weaving in new stuff, whether real or fantastical.

You may have seen a post from me before, but the initial response across subreddits was so positive that I felt that I would (hopefully?) be forgiven for the repeat post. Over the last few weeks, a friend and I have been building [emerge.fm](https://www.emerge.fm/) \- a platform that allows musicians to promote their work, and build their audience.

We've set up a [waitlist system](https://www.emerge.fm/portal/) and have crossed over a 100 sign ups in just a few days. Our goal is to try and build an awesome community of musicians in parallel with working on building out the product (slated to be done by early July) and I would love to hear what you all think. Any thoughts/feedback/criticism would be appreciated and if you think this sounds cool, **please join the waitlist** :)

Thank you!"

For those interested here's the link: https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhypeddit.com%2Fmelisandepope%2Fdeletedeletedelete%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0CHHpiDzoPAmV37noBxz0VBVzxAXEqp,50,musicians,15,
514,I had a bad gig experience and now I'm afraid of playing again,50,musicians,162,"I played with my band the other day in a small venue with some other bands, we play punk / metal and this is basically the first of many other shows in the way. Things didn't go that well and now I'm afraid of ever touching my guitar or to play in front of people. In other words, I feel like now I have stage fright.

To give some prior context, I play guitar for a couple of years and honestly I'm very good at it, people really respect my skills and I put a lot of effort into it. Despite all of this, I feel like a fraud and I have a hard time actually aknowledging my real value. Everyone expects a lot from me and that scares me.

On that night when we played, there was some trouble and we couldn't do a good sound check. For instance, I didn't even get to check how my guitar sounded and just plugged my stuff on stage, tuned and went for it after a very little adjustment.

Turns out the rhythm guitarist volume was too low for us to hear, and so it was the singer. I was also positioned in a bad corner of the stage were I couldn't even hear clearly the drummer. The place had bad acoustics and sometimes it was a complety mess. I couldn't keep the tempo with the band, which was also speeding up more than usual and fucked up some parts because of how ""blurry"" everything sounded.

Despite all of this, I tried to keep a good show and move to interact with the audience, which had a great time and even told me that my playing was awesome and received a lot of compliments. I know that I fucked some parts of some songs but I tried to keep a good face and had a lot of fun that night anyway.

Fast forward, we talk about the show during the day after and although everyone got their mistakes, I feel like I'm being accused of being the reason it didn't go well for the others. At this point I'm writing this more as a rant but most importantly, this is bringing me really bad feelings and I'm having trouble sleeping. I'm afraid of next band practice where we're going to listen to the recorded mix and relive the situation. I feel like because of this, I will be targeted or undervalued from now on on the band, and that makes me feel so bad.

516,Just found out that I have a song that went mega viral on YouTube music with uncleared samples.,50,musicians,139,"Throwaway account because I have no idea what to do in this situation. I released a song about 6 years ago and never even thought to check YouTube Music streams. It‚Äôs currently sitting the multi-millions. I found the instrumental on YouTube and wrote and released the song to it then found out that the hook for the song was literally the entire verse of another song that the original producer just jacked and used. No idea if they got it cleared. 

I did the math and the royalties that I‚Äôm owed will be between $50k and $400k. I‚Äôve contacted my distributor to connect my account to my YouTube Music account so that I can have access to the information and the money. My question is, what do I do? I can‚Äôt find the original producer for the best and I haven‚Äôt been contacted by the original artist or their team about the copyright infringement. 

Just need advice. Any input would be helpful."

529,So frustrated trying to promote my new music.,51,musicians,73,"So I've been playing music for over two decades now, played over 800+ shows in my 20s and toured all over the U.S. and europe (I swear I am not trying to humble brag!) but then I took a few years off from the grind and started a [new project called Perpetual Stu](https://perpetualstu.bandcamp.com/) and things are worse than I could've possibly imagined.

You're at the mercy of the algorithms, forced to constantly [make low-quality content](https://www.tiktok.com/@perpetualstumusic/video/7333319325186641195) in the hopes an extra couple dozen people might hear your track, and maybe worst of all ‚Äì you have real-time metrics reminding you how few people have actually checked your music out. People act like the whole ""you get paid $3 for every 1,000 plays you get on Spotify"" thing was the worst part of the modern music industry but I assure you, it barely cracks the top 10.

I'm lucky because my new project is basically bedroom pop so I'm not paying any money to record this stuff, but it's still a time commitment and I feel more than just a little cringe putting myself out there as a 40 year old father of two. I simply cannot IMAGINE if I was still in a band, responsible for 3-4 other people, AND we were paying $10k (or more!) to record only to have the music land with a resounding thud.

I know it's always been hard to promote music, but it seems like a lot of the essential apparatuses (for instance blogs that people organically read or non-algorithmic platforms) have been either nerfed to uselessness or eliminated altogether. There has to be a better way.

I'm sure everyone on here feels the same, so thanks for letting me vent. If you've got 2:30 and want to give my new [music video a watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaFnnqB6x9o&ab_channel=CloutChaser) and maybe cheer me up with some words of encouragement, that would be great.

When it did, I contemplated everything about my life and why I felt depressed for so many years no matter what I did. I realized it‚Äôs because I wasn‚Äôt pursuing music ‚Äì as a teenager, everybody thought I was going to become a studio musician, or go to Berklee for songwriting, and really make something of my music. But, I had some sort of identity crisis and ended up going to a preppy catholic college, studied journalism and didn‚Äôt think about music for a very, very long time.

Now, this is everything I think about. It‚Äôs everything I want to do and my goal is simply to make a living off of this (even if it‚Äôs a terribly low income living, lol). So, I decided to pursue the easiest career I could think of, and now I‚Äôm a social media manager (and I work from home - I don‚Äôt want to take any job that isn‚Äôt work from home so I have more time for music).

But even with a work from home job as a social media manager, I‚Äôm finding it EXTREMELY hard to focus on music. I‚Äôm constantly worried about losing my job, or not making good enough content, etc. At the end of the day when I log off the computer, the only thing I want to do is watch tv. I just wish I realized this when I was a teenager so I could‚Äôve spent my entire college career taking lessons, releasing music and maybe I would‚Äôve been somewhere with it by now. But now as an adult with all of these distractions, I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll be near impossible to become successful.

548,"""What do you guys do for day jobs?""",49,musicians,244,"Just a rant that I think some of you will appreciate: We had a great bar/restaurant gig the other night, big party in front of us who were totally into it, whole place clapping after every song, some people getting up to dance, laughing at jokes, etc. Really fun. Everyone had a blast and the venue was super pumped (love it when the staff are into the band).

Afterward, we're out amongst the people who are leftover (we mostly play till the place closes, so just kind of the stragglers) giving out stickers, etc., everyone saying nice things, and this British couple who are clearly tourists to our very touristy city, come right up to us and do the thing I hate where they touch your arm for emphasis:

""Oh, you guys were just so fun! What fun! But I have to know: What do you guys do for day jobs!?!""

I find this question crushingly depressing. None of the five of us have day jobs. The band doesn't pay all our bills, but we have other bands and other little creative money-makers and do lessons, etc. We cobble it together. It's hard! And some of us have spouses/partners who pay a lot of bills, too, it's true.

But do people not realize how insulting this sounds (we don't get it THAT much, but enough to be a thing)? Like, ""I had fun, but you're OBVIOUSLY NOT PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS,"" or maybe they just think it's impossible in America to make a living if some of it involves playing restaurant gigs for tourists? Should I say, ""I'm just a loser musician, but my wife is a doctor!""

I was nice. Assured them that music and creativity is pretty much all we do, etc., and she seemed so disappointed by that. Like she wanted to imagine us at shitty cube jobs, getting to unleash our wildest dreams on stage in front of her before we return to our work-a-day misery.

I dunno. It just pisses me off and I wish people wouldn't ask that question. It makes me feel super shitty.

**EDIT:** To be clear, I don't think they were TRYING to be offensive or that they had ill-intent. That's sort of my point, that it's just thoughtless, not that they're weird for assuming we might have day jobs. I KNOW THAT MOST MUSICIANS HAVE DAY JOBS. Which is why, in the moment, I took it in stride. I just thought I'd find a community of people here who could empathize with not wanting to be asked about a day job after a successful gig. But, yeah, I get it, musicians don't make any money and, no, it's not crazy to think we might have day jobs. At no point did I imply they would be weird for thinking that; in fact, I offered that as one of the possibilities! I just personally think it's depressing that someone who enjoyed our show would think to ask what our day jobs are after enjoying it. Maybe ""pissed off"" is not the right way to put it. "

560,Do you think the Internet and social media has destroyed audiences ability to listen to music emotionally?,49,musicians,74,"I have this theory that with the internet being a place where you just want to disect information, comment and criticize on videos. that it's affected real world ability to sit down and really sink yourself into the world of the music as an audience member.

I spend 80-90 of time with my wife, mostly at home, but I am often hassled about how much time the bands take ""away from our marriage"". Is there any answer to this being accused of ""rather being with my jam buddies"" than to spend time at home. I am with her 6 evenings every week. Music is my ONLY hobby. Both bands play my original songs.  The ""working"" band has a great singer where I get to sing backups. In the ""weekly"" band I am the singer.

Admittedly, the summer is high-season for my bands and we pack our gigs mostly between June and October, so there are some months that get pretty dang busy. It can get annoying. But that pace isn't constant. It still averages out to one rehearsal midweek and one weekend show a month plus a few other (like 5-6 a year) daytime weekend rehearsals. Summer is also high season for complaining about my hobby.

I say to her I have one band that practices every week but does maybe 3 shows a year and the other band only rehearses occasionally, like5- 6 times a year on weekends, but that bands does basically 12 gigs a year. So, to me it adds up to the ""time"" of one band. She does want to hear that. She says I promised her years ago that I would not be in two bands. Maybe I did. I don't remember the incident. I only remember the hundred times she has brought it up along with accusing me of lying. 

She wants me to choose one band.

Today she mentioned the possibility of divorce again. It was probably a lashing out to hurt me because of her resentment and because it gets a reaction. I offered to go to Counseling.  I doubt it will come to that but I'm willing.

We're under no delusions of grandeur, we're not primma donnas and rarely have any drama in our band. We usually have grear sound engineers when playing live.

We played at a ski resort recently and I did something I've never done before - cut the show early and left due to an incompetent and rude sound engineer. 

It was crazy from the start. The soundy was way too aggressive, talked on and on about how he worked for some of the biggest bands, blah blah. When I first walked up, he immediately came up to me with some weird technical question while I was still huffing and puffing from the long walk up 6 flights of stairs. No hi, no introduction, just a pushy ass confusing question. Turns out he did the same with my bandmates. He set us all on edge from moment one, and never ceased making us feel inferior.

Here are some of the things he said, in no particular order: 

""Do you read music? No? I read music. I don't think you're a real musician until you read music.""

(After Bandmate joked with him that after working with so many big bands, it must be a letdown to work for a middling band like ours) ""Yeah, tell me about it.""

""Your guitar sounds like shit, dude, you should get a new one.""

""Listen, I'm not here to be friends, I'm here to protect my equipment from getting damaged."" (I retorted, ""Funny, I thought you were here to make the band sound as best you can."")

""You don't have a bass player? That's ridiculous. I'm a classically trained bass player. I read music. Do you read music?""

(After asking bandmate to give a complete run down of our stage plot, which I had emailed two weeks before the show, I told him we had already emailed it per his request): ""Yeah yeah, I know you emailed it but I didn't look at it, so I need you to verbally walk me through what you need.""

It went on and on.

Every time I asked for something simple, like more guitar in the stage monitor, he rolled his eyes and fought me on it. It took him 15 mins to finally get guitar into my wedge, then my bandmate started sound checking and I asked to have her instruments way down in my wedge. ""I can't seperate them out, they'll be at the same level the whole show"" he said. ""You CAN seperate them out,"" I said, beginning to lose my patience. ""I can't have her instrument that high in my wedge, it's too much and can't hear myself."" He rolled his eyes and got out a new cord, was done seperating the wedges in like 3 mins. (I know the board he was working with.)

The mains were just to my left on stage and I was getting WAY too much stage noise from them. I asked what could be done and sound guy shrugged and said, ""nothing."" It just sounded terrible on stage. Like I was playing in a hallway next to a gym. 

I finally stopped asking for things because it just got too awkward. When we started playing and the drums kicked in, I couldn't hear any guitar, could hear my vocals blown way out in the wedge and could hear my bandmate's banjo at top volume. And I could tell the mix was way too high for the mains. Some friends in the audience confirmed it sounded like shit and was way too high of a volume. There was steady feedback every song.

After every song, I would give him hand cues to adjust monitor (pointing to guitar, then up, pointing to mic then down, etc.) But he never understood them, or acted like he didn't.  He kept yelling over to us, in front of the crowd, ""What is it you want now? Can't you just deal with it? 

He was also a dial tweaker. Suddenly, without warning, my vocals would surge in the monitor and I'd have to back way off the mic. Then we kept getting massive  feedback, which he blamed on my guitar. I said it was my mic, and demonstrated it to him (this is all mid-show, mind you) and said the volume was way too high. He finally adjusted it.

Then, as if punishing me, I could no longer hear my guitar at all. It's like he cut it completely out of the wedges, not just for me, but for everyone. My drummer kept missing the 1 because he couldn't hear me. 

I could go on and on... this is just a sampling of that shitty night. After one set. We took a break and I went and had a beer with the manager, told her we were struggling with the sound guy and she said, ""Yeah, I can tell. I'm so sorry. Every band we've had this year has complained about him. I asked him to slow his roll, but he just said, 'this is how I talk.' If you want to bail, I understand.""

I told her she could pay us less if she wanted, but I didn't want to finish the gig. First time in 12 years of gigging live that I bailed on a show before the end. 

Sound guys: what do you think about his attitude? Isn't one of the duties of a live sound engineer to communicate with the band, not make them feel unwanted and stupid? How should I have handled this situation better?

We're just a group of dipshits who like to play music and have very little drama, but after this experience I felt like I was somehow missing something. Any thoughts?"

589,Don't buy a guitar mat or neck rest,46,musicians,30,"Donr buy a guitar mat for $35-$40. Instead, buy a yoga mat from Walmart for around $7-$15 and cut it to length.

Don't buy a guitar neck rest for $35. Instead, buy a yoga block for $7, and if you want, you can shape it (I dont)

Don't buy a straight edge ruler for checking neck straightness for $40-$50. Instead, buy an 18"" steel ruler from Amazon for $8

Don't buy a guitar pliers set from StewMac for $50. Instead, buy a 6pc pliers set from Walmart for $10-$12

590,Is it normal to charge the artist for letting them open for a show?,46,musicians,48,I got the opportunity to open for a fairly big artist. The promoter said i had to pay $2000 in order to perform. Is this normal?
591,Anyone else suffer from envy/jealousy when watching live bands?,46,musicians,32,"We just had two big shows in my area. Morgan Wallen (I'm a die hard outlaw/classic country fan, so not a big fan of his per se) and Black Label Society (giant fan of Zakk) play some shows over my way this past weekend. Unfortunately I wasn't able to go see BLS, and opted out of seeing Morgan Wallen. However, and its generally this way when I'm watching really just about anyone play that has any notoriety, I get this overwhelming sense of jealousy and envy. Not to the point that it would get in the way of my enjoyment of the show but more so a feeling like, ""I wish it was me"" up there. 

I've been playing music since I was a kid, and during my stint in the Marine Corps I decided I was going to attempt to chase my dreams to the best of my abilities. Long story short it has been a grueling process (to say the least). I know many of these bands kill themselves with how hard they work, but it's almost like.. what are they doing that I'm not. I know the face level answers to that question obviously but I swear I'm almost at a point in this game where I believe that it might just be that some people are insanely lucky, or st the right place at the right time (I know millions of them are just prodigy-level talents so don't roast me over the coals). 

Idk. I'm sure it's probably my own insecurities that lead me to feel that way, just curious if anyone else ever feels like this."

We have developed an app where you will be able to jam together and we are looking for people to test it! 

The app lets you upload videos of yourself playing an instrument. If someone else comes and likes your track, they can respond to it by playing over your base track. That will create a new video of the two playing together. If this keeps happening a tree of compositions will be created. Basically, like a reddit conversation but with music. We have also developed a way to explore this tree of compositions so anyone can join at any point they like!

We already shared the idea in this subreddit some time ago and got a really nice response from the community. We are looking for people that wants to try the app and get involved with the development by giving feedback. We are linking here our landing page where you can leave your email so we can send you the app and credentials. 

Please bare with us as the app is still in early stages of development. However, we want to have feedback from the community as soon as possible so we can shape Rifftr together.

610,What qualifies someone as a good or bad musician. What do  musicians who really know their stuff think about musicians that do the bare minimum?,46,musicians,103,"I ask because I‚Äôve gotten lots of feedback about myself over the years from many different people. I taught myself to play when I was a teenager because I was bursting with the desire to express my emotions. I‚Äôve gotten a lot better over the years but I keep things very simple. My guitar playing is terrible, my piano skills are mediocre but people like the emotion I put into my lyrics and voice.

My vocal instrument got much better over time but I was getting positive reactions even when I was technically a terrible singer. I‚Äôve gotten many compliments from musicians over the years, I even convinced a couple to let me be the frontman of my own band- musicians who were much much much better than myself.

I have gotten the biggest compliments and biggest criticisms days apart. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm offending actually talented artists when crowds respond positively to me. I‚Äôm asking because I‚Äôm genuinely confused to what actually makes someone ‚Äútalented‚Äù. I just consider myself to be passionate about expressing myself through music. This post really wasn‚Äôt supposed to be about me tho- I genuinely just want to hear y‚Äôall‚Äôs opinions about this if possible- thanks."
611,Playing in a ***really*** small room,45,musicians,129,"TL;DR How do you deal with playing, singing, when you‚Äôre drowned out by people who are there for drinking and dining?

My wife and I go to this small restaurant and bar now and then primarily to hear the live music, though the food and drinks are not bad. 

This place brings in musicians regularly. It‚Äôs mainly 2 or 3 people, on guitars with a singer. There‚Äôs no stage, they‚Äôre pushed into a corner of the place. They bring their own audio equipment. 

Anyway I feel sorry for the musicians. The talk is overwhelming (like last night). They get applause then the background talk gets loud again. 

These aren‚Äôt up and coming musicians trying to make it; they‚Äôre typically older and talented; it‚Äôs more a sideshow gig I guess. 

Have you played places like this and how do you feel while you‚Äôre playing and singing through the noise?"
612,How do you tell the band leader his songs are not good?,45,musicians,133,"I've played with a singer-songwriter for about a year, and he writes a lot of great songs. Some are not so great, but he really loves them. They're slow and meant to be emotional and inspirational, but I see the energy drain from the crowd whenever we play them. We tend to play bars, coffee houses, etc. so people can easily drift away. It's partly a generational thing: he's older and these songs are sort of 60s flower power ballads. The kind of stuff people my age make fun of, and I honestly get a little embarrassed. How do I bring this up nicely? Or do I need to accept it's not my group?"

627,What is the appeal of playing live to you ?,45,musicians,198,"What's your mindset like ?

Do you want to give joy to people ? Or other emotions ? 

Is it more narcissic in a ""look at me ! look at me !"" kind of way ?

Maybe you thougt you could get chicks easily (but you're the bassist) ?

Or is it just what musicians do, and you gotta go on stage because that's the trade ?

So why are you up there, what drawn you to be on stage ?"
628,If I dont like social media is it ok as a musician to not use it?,45,musicians,56,I had a good thing going on with each platform I was using. Just found myself disliking every platform I used. Im not generally a hateful guy and wish everybody well but I found I was creating content around so many things that bother me. So when it gets to that point I would delete every platform I ever had. I mean if labels arent signing me using social media is not a requirement right? It did bring in a few new listeners to my music but I learned how to dismiss validation. I just put out music because I love it. I really learned to stop chasing numbers and likes. What do you guys think? Is having social media a requirement as a musician? Im kinda sitting back right now. If a new company wants to come out with video hosting and creating content I would rather wait for something new than force myself to use what we have now.
629,why are musicians so flakey with putting together bands?,44,musicians,50," For  example my one band was looking for a new guitarist and we got tons of  interest on our ad, but out of like 5 who scheduled a try out with us  only one actually showed up and didn't cancel it at the last minute. Or  another time I saw a guy desperately looking for band mates on a local  facebook page so I message him and no response after weeks. I looked at  his activity in the page and he's literally been posting for 2 years  looking for members, no wonder why he hasn't found any.

Even  with craigslist ads I only get like a 50% response rate even though  they all make it seem like they're desperately looking for members.

What gives? If people want to be in a band so bad why is it so hard for them to do the bare minimum and answer/show up?"

639,Today i learned something horrifying happened within my band.. (advice please),44,musicians,32,"Me and my band mates have been working together for about 3 years.. This is a simple (we do it the traditional way, without technology except to record and mix) and small band, only 4 four of us. 3 male(including me), 1 female, All of them are my best friends. A few weeks ago i was talking to Marissa, the female, (not her real name btw) and we have been super close for several years.

Somewhere in the convo she told me shes been having an extremely hard time feeling comfortable helping us with our music (usually when we write we all are in the same room doing it together, put this cuz it comes up later) and she is thinking about quiting and she was wanting to know if i was ok with that, obviously i was a bit upset because i would miss her creativity and bonding over making music but i told her she should do whatever makes her happiest and that if this band is no longer one of those things, then she should try something else..

I was curious though, why after all this time and why did it feel so sudden? why did she feel uncomfortable?? i havent noticed her acting off around us but i didnt question it because i was more focused on making sure it wouldnt damage our friendship. Fast forward untill now, shes still been working with us so i assumed she decided not to but i was still curious and we had planned to meet up today just to hang out and talk about life so i decided id bring it up then and see what it was about ya know....

when i brang it up and asked her what the deal was, it was an instant mood killer. She got really quiet... she almost didnt even talk to me, she just sat there silent for such a long time, i told her that we dont have to talk about it and after a few minutes of silence she started crying and obviously i was confused and i felt bad for bringing it up because whatever the reason it obviously made her very distressed.

She stared straight ahead at a wall and told me that she isnt comfortable being around a certain person in our band (she refused to say who) because they raped her..

""Holy shit"" that was my instant reaction. it just came out.

i didnt and still dont know what to think, i dont know if i shouldve but i asked her who and she wouldnt answer so i left it at that and i told her that i can help her find help, this is serious and trauma is no joke but she said that she doesnt want to talk to anyone about it.

we sat there for a while, her shifting from silently crying to a cold blank look and me sitting there trying figure out what to say or do.

WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO??? i feel so sick thinking about how a rapist is going to be sitting in the same room as their victim in just a few days... and how both people are some of my best friends... ANY ADVICE??? I dont know who and if i ask both would obviously deny it do i tell authorities the fuck do i do? this definitly most likely going to ruin what we have going.

&#x200B;

Long Edit:

Thank You guys for all the replies, you guys have said alot of things i didnt even consider, i assume due to shock. I havent totally decided what to do but im thinking about departing from them and hopefully that will help marissa feel better about leaving as well.

Bands come and go, and your right, in this situation the music is probably the least important thing to be worrying about. It was selfish of me to focus more on the ""oh no we cant make music anymore"" part.

(Im not saying im quitting music, far from it.. if i do this, im going to try to make a new band (with marissa of course..hopefully) but without the same mistake of letting someone bad in because i didnt know them as well as i shouldve before hand. )

I feel like this morning, the knowledge of what happened has settled in even more then when i posted this.  Im not going to pressure her into saying who or do the legal stuff for her without her approval because that can make distress alot worse when the persons not ready.. but im going to try my best to non suspiciously (to the other band mates) make sure she doesnt feel like she has to spend another day with the guy that did it.

Also, the writting/jamming/whatever you guys call it session is cancelled for me.

Thank you! again!"

655,"After Years Of Playing, I Realize That I‚Äôve Been Playing The Wrong Instrument",43,musicians,42,"So I‚Äôve been playing guitar since I was 11. I‚Äôm almost 17 now.

And I am in fact a metalhead and so typically the music I play is fast and, obviously, heavy.

I started out by playing rhythm guitar and got bored after like 2 years. I didn‚Äôt want to shred or nothing (at the time), but I wanted a challenge.

So I moved up to lead and had a hell of a time. I was having so much fun and it felt like I had a whole array of options to chose from.

But then I‚Äôm scrolling through TikTok and I run into a Metallica TikTok. Now, I‚Äôll be the first to say, I was fairly snobby with the bands I listened too.

The video was a live performance of Creeping Death from like 1989 and it was the breakdown portion with Jason screaming ‚ÄúDie‚Äù over and over with James singing along with it.

I was very stubborn with Metallica but decided to give them a chance. And then I run into one TikTok that changed everything.

I see a TikTok of Jason Newsted playing a bass solo and I‚Äôm immediately intrigued in a way I haven‚Äôt been with guitar in a long time.

So I pick the bass up again and I start writing my own stuff. And holy shit, for the first time, I‚Äôm genuinely confident in what I‚Äôm playing and my capabilities!

I was actually capable of playing for people and not getting embarrassed, I felt I was doing it right! I didn‚Äôt have to play a cover of someone else‚Äôs song to feel like I was half decent.

Hell, I only play one song on the bass and I still have enough confidence to feel I‚Äôm a good enough musician! The rest I can play is my own stuff!

It‚Äôs dumb, but, y‚Äôknow."

663,"Pro Tip- If you are studying music, Learn how to record and use a DAW",43,musicians,22,"If you are studying music performance or teaching right now or you're about to start your undergrad I would seriously consider buying recording equipment and learning how to use a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).

I did a course in Music Tech when I was in high school and that skill seems to keep on giving especially right now. *The course in music tech wasn't even that difficult* and I bet most universities/conservators provide electives that students can pick.

When we were all asked to do a video exams and lessons when lockdown started it became apparent that my **Music Tech skills opened more doors to solve problems.** I cringed at most student‚Äôs exam videos as they didn't have the means to capture sound properly or edit their recordings so that their bad phone mics didn't distort.

Also if you want to become a composer I would argue that *DAW skills are way more important than Sibelius skills* as you can harness a DAW to explore creative arrangements, record other performers playing your compositions or manipulating midi instruments to try out new things. It really helps with inventing musical ideas quickly especially if you know your way around a midi keyboard.

**You only need to learn how to record yourself** with proper techniques and know your way around a DAW to capture your best sound. Leave all the complicated mixing, multitrack, session recording, midi sampling and plugins to the sound engineering students.

I would say that there's no real negative to this apart from the price to own the tech and software;

&#x200B;

* *Scarlett - ¬£132.00*
* *Rode nT1 vocal mic - ¬£151.00*
* *Mic Stand - ¬£30*
* *xlr cable - ¬£12*
* *MacBook pro - ¬£1348      (unfortunately I haven't found a windows alternative.)*
* *Logic pro - ¬£199*

That ¬£1872 is just really shit and is probably the only thing stopping lots of musicians exploring ways to capture their sound.

&#x200B;

IDK what do you guys think? agree or not?

P.S= I don't want people in the comments bitching about music degrees and debating if they're pointless or not. Just contribute if you have something to say about music tech skills being necessary or not.

671,How to Get Your Foot in the Door of the Music Industry,40,musicians,15,"**How to Get Your Foot in the Door of the Music Industry**

*By T. Perry Bowers*

This title is a trick. There is no door. There is nobody keeping you out of the industry and no\-one will open a magic door to let you in. 

If you wanted to get into the hardware business, you wouldn‚Äôt ask how to get in, you‚Äôd just start creating your business.  But for some reason there is a fantasy in the music industry about a guy behind a desk, smoking a cigar, pulling all the strings to let people in or keep them out.

While there are some powerful people pulling strings at the very highest levels, nothing could be further from the truth down here at the bottom.  However I have had two instances in the last few months that prove that the fantasy belief is still strong. 

In the first instance a young man came to me and asked if his song was any good. He played it for me on his iPad. It was absolutely terrible. It was a rap song, so it‚Äôs not a genre I consider myself an expert in, but I know bad music when I hear it. The rhymes were clich√©. The rhythms were simple and childlike \(actually he was off rhythm most of the time\). His lyrics were unimaginative and his beat was like something from a speak and spell in the eighties. It was so bad that I had to keep myself from laughing. But then, the weirdest thing happened. I got angry. 

I guess I got angry because the kid was wasting my time. It had nothing to do with his music being so bad. It was his obvious lack of work ethic that irritated me. It was one of the first songs he ever created. He had some late night inspiration, programmed the beat, wrote and recorded the lyrics on some cheap audio program, and decided he needed to speak to someone who owned a studio immediately to ‚Äúget his foot in the door.‚Äù  He hadn‚Äôt done any real work.

If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre probably a fairly serious musician. You practice your instrument at least a few times a week. You‚Äôve been in bands that played locally or even nationally. You work on your craft a lot and have been for a long time. This kid records a stupid rap song and goes straight to a studio owner trying to solicit advice and accolades. Does it make you angry too? 

I asked him who his favorite rapper is. He said Eminem. So I asked him how he thought his song compared to an Eminem song. He said his song was good, but obviously Eminem‚Äôs song was better. I asked him how he thought his rap style compared to Eminem‚Äôs. He said he had a different style, but he was getting better. I burst his bubble. I told him his beat and his lyrics were at a kindergarten level compared to Eminem‚Äôs. I told him he would have to put in tens of thousands of hours of practice if he wanted to get close to touching Eminem‚Äôs talent and skill. I told him ‚Äúgo home and work hard for a year and see what happens.‚Äù Well, it‚Äôs only been a month and he‚Äôs sent me some new songs. They‚Äôre still awful. I‚Äôm still annoyed. 

Even though I do appreciate his persistence, there is another thing that bothers me about this situation. I told him to listen only to himself. I said if he likes it and he thinks his music is good, then it‚Äôs good. Why is he asking me then? He obviously didn‚Äôt listen to my advice, which was ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask me if your music is good.‚Äù And he‚Äôs not listening to his own inner voice either. Listening to my inner voice is something I wish I had done a long time ago. It would have been really helpful in my twenties when I was really trying to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù as a musician. 

Your inner voice will tell you everything. It will tell you if your music is good and if a song is a ‚Äúhit‚Äù or not. It will also tell you if you are delusional. It will tell you if you‚Äôre addicted to drugs, if your marriage is a disaster, if you‚Äôre a good person or a lazy one. You just have to cultivate a relationship with that voice and listen to it. Once you have a clear connection to your inner voice, you don‚Äôt need anyone else to tell you what you need to know. 

Which brings me to my second circumstance ‚Äì another situation that reinforced my belief that people in the music business are mostly delusional. A young man sent me an email, saying he wanted to change his career and be a band manager. He was wondering if I could refer him to some band managers in the industry to give him some advice. The fact is, I‚Äôm not sure there is such a career as ‚Äúband manager.‚Äù There are people who perform functions for bands. You can call it whatever you want.  These people book gigs. They set up tours, organize recording sessions and perform functions the band doesn‚Äôt have time to do for themselves.

I once worked with a very successful independent rapper. I witnessed how he put his own tours together, negotiated his own rehearsal space rent, paid his own rehearsal space rent, set up rehearsals with his band, booked TV show appearances, etc. He was his own manager. He was making millions of dollars but he was not outsourcing the role of manager to anyone. He may have had some folks who helped him do things, but he was managing his band. On his own. Period. 

So I have set up a meeting with this young man and I‚Äôm going to tell him that a ‚Äúband manager‚Äù simply provides services for a band. The first service they might need is help hauling their gear on the road.  I was lucky enough to call Monty Lee Wilkes my friend. He was a very successful band manager and front of house engineer \(Nirvana, Replacements, Brittany Spears\). He was pushing road cases before he started managing anyone. 

This is how you get your foot in the door. You start doing the things that bands need. Hauling gear, booking shows, running the table, creating an email list, whatever they need. Don‚Äôt focus on the title of the job, think about what the job actually requires. My advice to this kid is going to be ‚Äúfind a band and do something helpful for them.‚Äù It‚Äôs very simple. Make yourself valuable to the artists and do something for them that they can‚Äôt \(or don‚Äôt want to\) do for themselves. Most importantly, do something that makes you and the band some money. If you can‚Äôt find opportunities to make money for your artists, you are useless as a manager. 

At the beginning it‚Äôs going to suck. There are a lot of road cases to be pushed and sandwiches to be purchased. If you want to be an artist yourself, there will be times when you want to cry because your own music is so bad. But, if you really want it, and few people actually do, you will persevere. It may take you a thousand hours, but it will happen. Start small. Provide service. Create opportunities for yourself or your artist. Repeat. Over and over again.

Years ago I put out a Craigslist ad to see if I could get any work as a piano player/keyboardist and I woke up to about 20 emails, some of them were kinda demanding and rude.

677,"what are the people called who play the instruments for someone on tour, but aren‚Äôt actually in the band permanently?",40,musicians,142,"yes this is a super weird question, i know they‚Äôre like the backup band, but what is the actual job called of someone who does that?"
678,You don‚Äôt need to be in a band to make music or play shows,42,musicians,24,"A lot of the posts on here are about band drama, people depressed because their band broke up, people struggling to start bands, etc. As a musician who has played lots of shows and never officially been in a band, I just wanted to share my perspective in case it helps someone.

I‚Äôve always hated having to coordinate with other people to play music, so since I got into a music I‚Äôve always been attracted to styles that don‚Äôt require other people‚Äîelectronic music, classical guitar, folk guitar, free improv, and noise. Also composing classical music where yes you do need work with other people for your work to be performed, but often that just means submitting to a competition.   

Now that‚Äôs all well and good, but what if you don‚Äôt already have an affinity for a style of music that is well suited to solo artists or play an instrument that is conducive to solo performance? How do you craft a solo set, and how do you find gigs as a solo act? For guitar players it‚Äôs pretty easy. You could just learn a style of guitar playing that works ina solo guitar context. Or if you want to sound like a band, just get like a looper or sampler, maybe a pitch shifter, a drum machine, and crank it up. Or just use Ableton. As long as you keep in mind what would be interesting to watch as an audience member while you‚Äôre writing, you can create a pretty engaging set. But let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a drummer or a saxophonist or something. What do you do in that case? Lots of drummers are creating awesome live shows playing an acoustic set and triggering events in Ableton or a sampler using a few pads. And for wind/brass players‚Äîyou can use guitar pedals too, and also EWIs have come a long way.

Now how do you find shows? If you‚Äôre playing lots of rock shows, you might find that it‚Äôs hard to book a solo show. Well, you‚Äôll find that alternative music scenes are actually a lot more accepting of different genres than you might think. You will see lots of solo folk or synth pop sets at like black metal and noise shows. I‚Äôm not advocating for a full scale gentrification of the harsh noise scene by Reddit bedroom producers. I‚Äôm just saying there are very accepting alternative music scenes out there.

But don‚Äôt you need to play with other people for like, your soul or whatever? Communing with your fellow man through the joy of song is magical and healing! I play in orchestras, I do one of improv sets and jams. I even do occasional collaborative albums. I play with other people a lot. And it‚Äôs good‚Äîthat‚Äôs how I network to promote my solo work. But most of the serious music I make is by myself. So if you want the healing power of playing with other people without being in a band, just join a choir or something. Just wanted to share because I suspect there might be other people on here who work best alone but don‚Äôt know how many alternatives there are to being in bands."

680,Why are so many famous musicians not necessarily the best skilled?,40,musicians,116,"As musicians, musically it is important to stand out. But have your noticed that most famous musicians arent necessarily the best musicians out there in terms of musical skills, but yet they sell albums and have a huge following? E.g. Ed Sheeran. His music is quit basic but yet he is popular. 

Why do you think this is? What makes him and so many regularly skilled musicians so famous?"
681,I was tired of traditional social media so I created a social network for underground artists to post snippets of their music,43,musicians,19,"Imagine if TikTok + SoundCloud had a baby. The whole idea is to take the best part of TikTok and apply it solely to music so that artists don't have to feel like content creators!! The listeners on the app are specifically there to find small artists before they blow up. It's all about the music - nothing else matters. Plus, it appeals to the lowering attention spans without you having to sacrifice your art.

I basically built this all by myself so I know there are probably bugs. I'm honestly just trying to figure out if this is something that artists want and whether it actually solves a problem... I'd appreciate any feedback you have :)

Their music taste aligns exactly with mine, and when I saw them, they had a bunch of different people doing vocals for different songs plus all singers where also playing guitar while singing. I can sing most of their set list and would love to join as a dedicated lead singer, but is that rude to ask if they‚Äôre not particularly looking for one?

Update: gonna be an opener for them in another basement show in a few weeks as a solo act just doing a couple songs, and I‚Äôll be singing with them on 2 songs in their set list. Responses were a little split and after talking to the guy I originally knew, it came up that he was looking for an opener so I just took that opportunity.

689,I got into music school and just wanted to share,41,musicians,10,"I've wanted to be a professional musician for almost half my life now, and just got the news that I was accepted into a highly appreciated music school. So I'm going to be a trained pro-musician as well as a bass teacher! Felt like I wanted to share since this is literally my dream come true, this is the third time I applied to this school and the first time I even made it through the preliminary rounds... The first time I applied was in 2015 I think, so this was over 6 years in the making. So if any of you are struggling with this as well, remember that you're not in a hurry, it's not too late and you can definitely do it if you have persistence.

I don't want to share the exact school for privacy reasons, but it's in europe. If anyone needs tips or wants to ask something about the application process I'll be glad to answer! I've applied to various schools over the years so I can definitely give pointers.

In any way, I wish everyone else luck now that the world is returning to normal!"

I put together a short 6-song setlist to play, and I play a small first show to about 10 people. I played 3 covers and 3 original songs and It went amazingly well, and I felt awesome! I still don't know how it went so well lol 

Well, word spread around, and people starting asking me again, as a lot of them missed the first time I played. So tonight, I played again. Roughly the same setlist, but I modified it slightly. This time, 30-35 people showed up! Still went awesome! Even better this time, as I was a little less nervous. I did the same thing, 3 covers and 3 originals.

They stimulated my imagination and gave me a perspective on music.. Five years later I've become a probstyle  level singer thinking I'm going to start a band that'll travel the country and be like a rock reggae band that was so dope that id be famous. I have the physical package for that, but I found out that's not necessary to do in my life. Finances got super weak and smoking weed hasn't helped. But if anything my confidence to hold my own with pro level singers and to be respected some for my talent has been great. I respect the guys who do this full time blue collar.

706,What do you do if you have to poop really bad during a gig?,41,musicians,189,
707,Band that don't tell you what they're playing when you try out,39,musicians,119,"UPDATE : Thanks everyone for your thoughts. To clarify - I was brought in for rhythm guitar, so I couldn't get away with noodling leads. The songs were originals and pretty obscure covers. 

I tried out for a band recently. I asked what songs we'd be doing and they sent their entire setlist, without chord sheets. At the practice I asked about the chords of the songs they were about to start, and they'd tell me the key and then go. I had to basically follow along by looking at their fingers on the fretboards. I was able to basically work it out, with some leads, although I was shaky. I thought that was impressive, considering, but they sent me a vague rejection the next day.

I just find this really frustrating and unprofessional. I can't tell if it's them being unprepared or if it's some kind of hazing. Do bands really expect to find someone who knows every song in a genre or has perfect pitch allowing them to pick up any chord being played? People like that exist, but they're session players in Nashville, not people looking for something to do with their weekends.

I thought explicitly asking for songs would help, but that didn't work. Should I just refuse to play with people who won't send song sheets over?"

I believe in you. Success will taste very sweet.

709,Is it ok/cool to sing in English when it's not your mother tongue?,42,musicians,110,"Hi, I'm Belgian (French native speaker) and just started a band with a friend of mine. We're mostly playing my songs which I wrote mostly in English. Yet, English is not our mother tongue and I can hear that when we sing, we've got a French accent... we also hesitate whether to use one word or another... It just doesn't feel natural in practice.

What feels natural though, is to write my songs in English because basically all my influences are English/American/Australian bands. To me, music has been associated to English since I was a child...  It just comes out this way when I compose with my guitar... But I feel a little ashamed that I'm not using my native language - French - which I find sounds silly and naive when played in pop songs (I mostly write pop-indie songs).

Also, I feel like it could be perceived as stupid by English native speakers to sing with an accent. Do you ever laugh at accents in singers' voices? (speaking to English native speakers here). As a native English speaker, what would your advice be?

For others, non-native-English-speakers: Have you ever asked yourself these questions? How did you deal with it? 

Thanks !!"
710,Should I quit?,41,musicians,66,"I‚Äôve been in a duo (singing) for almost 2 years. The guitarist is VERY talented, and we sound truly great together. 

But his personality is rather flat, kind of a downer, never excited about anything, and we‚Äôre not really friends. We have practices and gigs, and light chit chat sometimes during those. In the beginning I‚Äôd suggest grabbing a drink or hanging out, but was met with rejection every time. He never shares pics of us to his socials, though he promotes our gigs with pics of just himself.

Now he‚Äôs started a new project with his wife and two friends, and he‚Äôs posting pics of them all cliquey and happy. It straight up makes me feel bad. Like, why am I second-rate? 

I don‚Äôt have another musical project right now, so quitting would mean not performing - which would suck. But emotionally and socially I‚Äôm getting a negative impact that basically nullifies the musical positive.

All thoughts, perspectives, ideas welcome."
711,How do you know if your music sucks?,40,musicians,118,"I've been the front for a rock band for about 4 years and we've had consistent gigs, good feedback, and we have about 200ish monothly listeners on Spotify from some playlists we're on. 

Problem is, that's pretty much where we've plateaued. We haven't seen any growth in a while and we never really have a lot of people return to see our shows. Every now and then someone specfically comes out to see us, but we'd be up a creek if we had to sell tickets to a decent sized venue. 

We get paid gigs to play shows at venues that keep having us back, but we're playing like, 50% cover songs at those shows. When we do play a legit music venue, we don't make much money and we have terrible luck selling merch. 

Is this the ""indie band experience"" or do we just suck?"

I've self released 3 full length albums and 13 music videos. I live in Las Cruces, New Mexico and gig around town at various bars and restaurants. I try to keep consistent with posting content, but just feel I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe the truth is that my originals aren't very good. I do love music and really want a career in the world of music, but am open to shifting gears to find something else I'm better at....starting a gear/playing YouTube channel, playing guitar for an established artist, working at an indie label.....etc.

Def not looking for a pity party here...just curious how people landed in their musical gigs that might not have been what they originally set out to be. 

Just wanted to hear about fellow artists who started out trying to make it off their own stuff but ended up changing gears into a different avenue in the world of music and how that all has worked out for you? Appreciate your time!

724,Old band mates,41,musicians,16,"A few days ago, my bandmate from about 14-15 years ago sent me an fb message with a recording attached. Hadn‚Äôt heard from dude since like 08, so it was a surprise, but coo to hear from him. They‚Äôre all doing well now. The recording was the first song ever written by my first band from when I was like 17-18. First song ever written, even as individuals. Someone rewrote it, recorded it, and mastered it. Unbelievable. The intro had pieces of our other songs in the which had this coo effect of tuning an old radio. We never had the money to record, so the kids could only listen to our crusty garage recordings from our MySpace (RIPüôèüèº) Anyway, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this. Somebody still finds our music relevant to them. They took the time to dig up this forgotten fossil of a song from the abyss and made a clean recording out of it and we always wanted that. The details and fills I did with my drums, even the way I hit the bass pedal was precise in the recording, along with the other instruments. How can somebody remember that? I find it incredible, really. But, more importantly, thinking about it let‚Äôs me know that I did something right for people, that all 5 of us did. We came together and collectively wrote music that people enjoyed. We actually played a part in shaping memories that these people found worth hanging on to. Thats a real good feeling and good feelings are good for you. All we were was a few teenagers with music constantly on our minds, few instruments in hand, ready to explain our hearts, through our art. We were the ones responsible for making the kids wanna tear down the basement of Jerry‚Äôs Pizza every time we played. We were the ones responsible and made music for the kids, by the kids.

For years my dad talked about how he used to borrow his friend's Baldwin guitar, and it was the best guitar he ever played. Well, I worked my ass off, skipped meals, and didn't spend money on anything but groceries or bills for a couple years, and three years ago I finally saved up enough to buy him one for his birthday - it was the most expensive thing I'd ever bought (I think it was about $500) and I was so happy to finally get it for him. I don't think he'd ever had a really nice guitar before - just a cheap acoustic, and whatever friends would lend him for shows.

I just found out that his roommate stole it and probably sold it. There's no way I could ever afford to replace it now, since I have health problems and can't work full time anymore (not to mention the quarantine.) It feels like a kick in the teeth during an already ridiculously difficult time in my life, especially since my dad has been sick with Covid-19 for over a month now. 

I'm hoping to save up for one of the newer Baldwins I've seen on Ebay, which are cheaper, but it could be years before I have $200 to spare, and my dad is in such bad health I don't know if he'll make it that long.

Sorry again - just had to complain somewhere where someone might understand."

735,Seems like there's more money in engineering and sound than performing,41,musicians,36,"Just an observation/thought:

Me: worked many years as house sound board operator for Rodeo, truck audio A1 for broadcast, Location sound and will God Willing make it to my A2 gigs this summer. It's mostly been TV broadcasting, but currently working on a Commercial Music degree and learning DANTE, Pro Tools, also sight reading for guitar, bass, piano, Classical Guitar. (Been playing since I was 13, currently 43, just never learned sight reading)

Just burnt out on doing just TV/film for the past 20 years, I feel dead creatively, my work is empty and boring,  it's just not as cool as working/being around music. Would much rather hear a cool band, mix a cool record or rock a cool guitar riff than film some talking head/CEO or do audio for a sports game. I actually had a punk radio show on AMP and made some money for a while doing that, II have lived it, breathed it and I have an in-depth knowledge. Would love to be a performer on stage. I like singing, playing guitar, bass, I love to rock. But how realistic is that?? It seems that the sound engineers, recording, mastering engineers and such make much better pay than musicians. I mean, how many top bands are there? Most local bands don't make any money (when I did it in my 20's we played for free or open mic nights) Of course, I'm a LOT better now because I'm taking proper music classes, but still, I heard the chances of making a living playing music playing on big states/concerts are like less than 1% or something like that?

I mean, it's kind of discouraging because all my friends keep telling me I'm wasting my time on this degree and everything, that there's no money in music."

  I'm so ready for it though. I've been training all my life for what's happening and I can't wait to experience the ride for as long or little as it lasts.

740,Feeling gutted about not being accepted into a band.,39,musicians,89,"I'm a very passionate singer who's been singing for years, have done back up singing for friends and for some projects but have never put myself out there to officially join a band or for an audition etc. 

I sometimes can have really bad social anxiety and can suffer from panic/anxiety attacks from time to time, although this has significantly improved compared to many years ago. 

So yesterday I somehow gained the courage to attend an audition at a studio with a live band, they're a prog band looking for a vocalist and I adore metal and am very interested in being a part of a band; especially one that dabbles in prog or metal. 

Days before the audition I kept getting the urge to cancel the audition (anxiety does that to you) but somehow managed to soldier through, turned up to the audition and met the band members. This was my first EVER experience in my entire life singing alongside or even performing with a band, as well as massively venturing outside of my comfort zone by singing in front of strangers that I'd only just met that day for the first time. I've never had the chance or opportunity to do this before so there was many big ""first's"" on this day.

I'd been practicing two songs the band wanted to try out together in the days before the audition but had trouble keeping well timed with the live band. We tried playing and singing alongside the track and I found myself to significantly improve with the timing when we did that, the other bassist and guitarist also stopped multiple times for little mistakes (as is to be accepted when you're merely practicing or rehearsing). I was reassured that me making errors with the timing was okay and was to be expected as it was our first time jamming together.

I felt like I got on really well with the band members, there was a lot of banger and general funny back and forth, we all went home on our separate ways then I didn't hear from any of the band for almost 24hrs. Obviously after an audition you expect an update and I began getting a really bad gut feeling that I was about to be told no. 

Mustered the balls to message the bassist that I was in contact with and asked whether I'd be joining their ranks and if I'd be at the next rehearsal or not...

Then received a message saying I had a great voice was vocally in tune but that the problems I had with timing were a big issue and because of this they wouldn't be accepting me into their band. üò≠üò≠

I'm absolutely devastated now. Not just because this was one of my first proper times putting myself out there as a vocalist but because I genuinely thought it went well when that obviously wasn't the case. 

I REALLY would love to be a part of a band but experiences like this are so demotivating and make you want to just give up. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this before? And what did you do after or how did you handle the experience? Did you give up or continue and eventually find a band or something that suited you? 

Big thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this, it's really appreciated! üíú Trying to not give up here and just take this as another learning experience but it still feels very üí©.

Edit: ****Oh my goodness, all of you are just so thoughtful, supportive and understanding; thank you so much for all the advice, tips, sharing of your own personal experiences and just in general, overall feeling of being heard and understood. ü´∂

You've no idea how much I appreciate all of your comments, this is my first post on Reddit after a situation that really knocked my confidence but after reading all of your kind, constructive and judgement-free comments, I feel more motivated now to keep on with the path I've just begun on and not let one audition ending with a no stop me from making even more progress. I have a lot I can work on and with now and will definitely be taking a lot of the tips mentioned in this thread on board, especially buying and working alongside a metronome, I think that'll work wonders! ü•π

I've always been the kind of person who is always eager to improve and get better at my craft and after hearing that many people experienced the same with auditions in the realm of music, it's made me realize it's more common that I initially thought. Not just that but you shouldn't let one audition not going the way you want equal giving up on something you love *entirely*. 

Y'all are an amazing bunch of people and are a great community and I can't thank you enough!! ü•πü•∞üíñüíï"

I've been making music for about a decade and I've never really had this problem until I started trying to promote my band this year. Tbh, things are going well for my band. We have regular gigs, people actually enjoy our original music (not just cover songs), and we're getting paid a decent amount for the shows. I have a lot of fun and I really enjoy playing with them and making music.

Everytime I get on insta I see other local bands playing venues I want to play at. I see someone make a post like ours and get tons of likes. I go to see other bands shows and they have photographers there and tons of fans online that actually show up to their gigs and it's making me become someone I never thought I'd be.

I catch myself complaining that we don't get shows at ""good venues"" or saying that we need to do better stuff on social media, when I know that stuff doesn't really matter. I want us to be sucessful and I know social media is a part of that, but I think it's making me a worse person and a worse musician. I don't really know what to do about it at this point. I feel like I've just become jaded and cynical and I really hate myself for it. I feel like that woman who got famous for saying, ""My life sucks... I'm an artists and blah blah blah...""

TL;DR: I get bad FOMO when I go on social media and see other bands doing well and I hate myself for it."

754,Landlord wants me to stop singing,39,musicians,46,"Hey everyone! 

I am new to this sub, but thought this would be a good place to post this question, as I am sure some of you will be able to relate to my issue. I apologize in advance for how long this is going to be. 

So I am majoring in Music Education, and my instrument is voice. I have been singing my whole life and I hope to one day teach vocal lessons to kids and young adults. I just started my first semester in the fall and all of my classes are online. This means my vocal instruction, applied voice, ear training, and ensemble class are all taking place via zoom. I have been taking these classes since August and I have not heard a single complaint. Neither my landlord or any of my neighbors have sent me any sort of messages or complaints about singing. I never sing past 9pm or before 10am because I am always very respectful about quiet hours. 

I am living in a small 1 bedroom apartment with my boyfriend. It's about 400 square feet and we do not have a walk in closet, or any space that I can sound proof. My boyfriend also works from home and he uses his the bedroom as his office so I do all of my classes and all of my practicing in the living room. 

On Wednesday, my landlord came and knocked on my door in the middle of my voice lesson (at 3 in the afternoon) and told me that I needed to stop singing. When I told him that I was in the middle of a voice lesson, he shrugged and told me that two tenants have moved out because of my singing, and that he has neglected to tell me because he didn't want to hurt my feelings. When I asked him what he expected me to do, he just kinda shrugged and kept repeating that two tenants have moved out because of my singing. I told him that I could move farther away from the windows (which were closed) and he kinda shrugged again and said ""I don't know if that will work"". This whole time my vocal instructor was sitting there on zoom listening to the whole thing go down. I told my landlord that I might have to move to a different apartment if I can't sing at this apartment because that's what I'm going to school for. He kinda shrugged again and said ""I don't know."" I still had to finish the second half of my vocal lesson feeling like complete and total shit and just wanting to die. 

From the tone of the conversation, it seemed to me like my landlord was trying to subtly suggest that I move out. That is what I assumed because that was the only solution that made sense to me. Also the fact that he told me two tenants have moved out because of my singing. (And repeated it twice even though he claimed not to want to hurt my feelings) That really made me think that he was suggesting I leave because it would be cost effective for him to get me out of the complex so that he will stop losing tenants. 

So later that night my boyfriend called my landlord to talk about the possibility of getting out of our lease early. My landlord told him that he wasn't interested in anything like that and that we would not be able to get out of the lease early. He suggested that I just ""keep it down."" At this point my boyfriend got kind of upset and told him that I'm going to school for singing and that it is completely unreasonable for him to expect me to stop. He then asked why we were never informed when people complained about my singing and he said that nobody has complained before and that he was actually in a bad mood and it was just annoying him. (My landlord doesn't even live in the complex, he is just here doing maintenance a lot) Which makes no sense because how would he know that two tenants moved out because of my singing if they had not complained?? Also why would he keep letting tenants out of their lease because of MY singing and then not let me out of my lease. It seems like he was lying about tenants moving out to guilt me enough that I would stop singing, but I'm not sure. 

At this point I genuinely don't feel comfortable in my home anymore and I'm upset that he would not let us move out after he basically just told me I can't do the thing I'm going to school to do. I'm supposed to practice every day and I have a vocal performance (via zoom) coming up very soon and I don't even have the courage to practice for it. I haven't practiced once since Wednesday when he came to my door because I just feel completely insecure. I am a talented singer, I know my voice doesn't sound bad but it can be loud. I try to sing quietly most of the time unless I am in a performance or a vocal lesson, but it's clearly not enough for him. I can't enjoy singing at all now, and I don't currently have access to a practice room or anything.

I am at a loss. I don't have any idea what I should do about this. Is there anyone out there who has any advice for me or who has been through a similar experience? If so please help me!!"

760,"Dear cover/ bar bands, You sound like crap and here's why...",44,musicians,33,"Here's some advice. You can take it or leave it.

You are too loud. With a near certainty I can tell you that you are playing too loud, and you don't sound as good as you should because of this. Actually, you probably sound like shit. Think of the car next to you at the red light with the overdriven bass- does that sound awesome?

The acoustics in most bars suck, and being loud just makes it worse. If the people in the back of the club cannot talk until the song ends, you are doing it wrong. The best sounding bands are only loud in front of the stage. People should be able to have a conversation in the back of the venue without screaming into each others' ears.

Your mix is wrong. You don't need Todd Rundgren to figure this out. Have someone's girlfriend tell you whether all the members can be heard from where the people will be.  And, you all know who the better players are, and who the weakest link is. Dial down the weaker player just a touch, they make the better musicians sound bad. Duh. 

Loudness does not trump musicianship. As long as people can hear the drums, they will fill the dance floor. They don't need to go deaf to have a good time...

761,"If music made a lot more money, would you pursue it as a career?",38,musicians,86,"If you don't make an income off of music and do something unrelated for a living, is it mainly due to the lack of economic oppurtunity in the field? Or is it for another reason? Such as lessening your creative drive, not making the stuff you want, not wanting to make it your identity? Fear? Unethical side of the business?

In other words, would you do it for a job if it paid enough to sustain a career? Everyone talks about the lack of economic sustainability in this field, but are there other factors holding you back from pursuing a music career?"

Went on at 9 and played to that band plus a few others. Great set! Very proud of us for bringing our A-game and we had a lot of fun. The crowd sort of came out at around 11, well after our set, but even then there were never more than ten people, excluding our band.

764,Am I a diva for wanting to have a setlist/rehearsals?,39,musicians,62,"I‚Äôm a drummer and I‚Äôve been helping this artist with their music/performances. 

We initially connected last year at a wedding gig and this year, we‚Äôve been doing more and more performances together and organizing some more events for later in the year. It‚Äôs been fun getting to know them and working with them. 

There is just one thing that I keep thinking of and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being pretentious for this. Am I a diva for wanting a setlist and rehearsals? 

For the past few performances we‚Äôve done, we would have one rehearsal and only go through a small portion of the setlist, by small, maybe 5 songs of the 12+ song setlist. We would then perform the show, and the artist would pick songs at random from the setlist, extend the songs and change the feel from the recorded versions. 

The more recent performances we‚Äôve done, we don‚Äôt do any rehearsal, and we just follow what chords they start with and do our best to follow them. 

I love when artists improvise, however, I know artists improvise based off knowing the form of the songs backwards and front. 

I want to be upfront with them and say we need some discipline and preparation but I don‚Äôt want to sound like a disciplinarian, how can I do this?"

Ended up keeping me for the tour but I am not 100% either a note off, major one is a song where the solo lasts 8-10 measures with a harmonica solo is built in and I come in late or early on a change. The album has two guitars and live is one so it's critical for me to hold it down on bass. I am well respected in my city but realize I have a lot to learn. Band leader is very passive aggressive with me making it a brutal tour ontop of making 1/4 my income. I understand his position just probably done doing live session work as I'm not quick enough to learn material and is defeating to be a let down. Going home with my tail between my legs but traveling and learning was still a nice experience."

771,How much does a solo performer make for playing at a packed bar?,41,musicians,42,"On Friday I was at a VERY busy waterfront bar. A very talented singer was performing, playing guitar and switching to piano. He used a looper sometimes to add some depth to his songs. He was very good - knew a million songs. Sang medleys of hits, played for well over an hour straight with no break. The crowd loved him and were dancing and singing. That said, everyone was there for the party scene at the bar, and were not traveling to see this person play. I know this because the bar is on an island and many people were on boats and vacations and they were going to be at that bar no matter who was playing. The bar is located in New England. 

My cousin thought the musician would get paid $10,000 for the gig. I said no way. I thought $500 is a good rate for one person, one night. But maybe he got $1,000 for the night? Am I off base? Is he earning a lot more than what I thought was the going rate? Anyone have similar experience or inside knowledge? Just curious."
772,Band practice gone wrong,39,musicians,20,"So. I‚Äôve been practising with my band in a two apartment place. It was our only option, really. We live in Iceland, and essentially we are all broke. We tried getting practise spaces but we only got shitty options that were way too expensive. So we settled with guitarist #2 apartment.

First day the neighbor calls the cops. Keep in mind the law states we can play from 8 AM- 10 PM legally. We were playing at around 16 PM and it only lasted maybe an hour. Not much. We also tried to be as quite as possible. He calls the cops on us and they do nothing because it is legal.

Skip two weeks later he calls the cops again. Lying to the cops that we‚Äôre doing something illegal. Yeah. The cops search the apartment and tell us that it was not a noise complaint. And so they leave.

After a little facebook stalking I found out this dude is a snobby rich guy who has lived in Costa Rica in a huge house. He‚Äôs essentially lived a good life and had good jobs. Meanwhile me and my band are in our early 20‚Äôs, work shitty jobs with shitty pay and this is our way of having fun.

Any tips? Anything is appreciated. I personally think the guy is just being an asshole."

Started singing, and came to love it. Got hired by another church to play lead guitar. Joined a country band from Craigslist. Band broke up after 1 gig.

Now I'm front-man for a 90s rock cover band, 'Abercrombie & B\*tch'. Spent 5 months finding (and replacing) members, building set list.

787,My guitarrist had an ego crisis and deleted our whole instagram,40,musicians,60,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I want some input from some people who have band experience.

I have a small band, with 5 members (including me on bass). A few months ago, I wrote a song on my own, and wanted to produce it with my band. We recorded the song, took a little more than 50 hours of collective work (each instrument/ vocal, and the technical part). Since I had already composed the lyrics and the instrumental, each member only had to play their instruments, except for our drummer, who also took care of the recording stuff. 

The song ended up being very good, and everyone seemed to be satisfied with it. But the guitarrist said it was better if we made a few more songs before we released that one as part of an album. Everyone agreed.

Months go by, and no new song had been made. I express my thoughs about leaving my song gathering dust, and how I wanted to release it. The singer said he didn't dislike the song, but wanted to have the band linked to some more serious songs, and I respected his opinion. 

My guitarrist, on the other hand, said that he thought the song sounded bad, and he didn't want to have his name associated with bad songs, so I ""should release it as a solo artist, and don't cradit him"" (his words)

Since he made it pretty clear that he didn't want his name on it, but had no problem with it being released, I posted the song on SoundCloud. 

A little more than a week passes by, and he starts raging over the song being released with ""his parts"" on. An demanded that I recorded it without his guitar. I didn't have a problem with it, was only a little upset about changing it. (But I understand he has this right, despite saing it was ok for me to released it as it was)

This turns into a fight among the band members, because we were having a problem about his ego problems, and that was the last straw for them. 

He started saying that he was the only one putting time and effort on the band (totally not true) and that only he knew how to make a successfull band, despite never having one. 

After a few hours discussing, we agreed on him leaving the band, and thought that was the end of it. 

Later we find out that he had deleted everything on our instagram.

Sorry for the long post, bur I wanted to vent about this situation with other musicians. 

I forgot to mention that this guy was my best friend.

My band mates have messaged the nicest studio around and gotten a quote. Obviously it‚Äôs pretty pricey but this studio has recorded a lot of high tier groups. The quote was per 12 hour digital days.

Soon after receiving the quote we discussed what we‚Äôd like to record. Here‚Äôs where I may be crazy. I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôd be lucky in that amount of time to get five songs done. These guys are insisting that we can ‚Äúgo in tight and crack through a bunch‚Äù.  They‚Äôre talking about each one of us having three original songs ready for the one 12 hour session.  I think they are nuts, and that we‚Äôd be crazy going in like that, and that studio time needs to be intentional and we need to be prepared to listen carefully to the engineer we‚Äôd be working with and to have plenty of time to get things right.

I wonder if I‚Äôm the dick here?"
809,i can listen to music in my head.,36,musicians,61, is it normal to hear good quality music in head?. not always but sometimes i can hear every single instrument in very good quality in my head. it feels like real music. i'm a guitarist and very frequently i can just from top of my head remember a song that i listened years ago and just play it on guitar from memory. i don't know the notes tho but i know my guitar very well and i can just play songs on it. maybe a muscle memory?.. is it normal?

I started playing drums 2,5 years ago. 
I had 1 year of drum lessons and the rest of it I learned by myself. (Electric drum kit)

I learned a lot alone just sitting on my kit and playing musics that I like.

The point is, I‚Äôm still a beginner. Is it too late ? If I really want to, could I spend 2/3 years really learning music and practicing the drums and become a drummer? Is is possible? Or should I just keep doing it as a hobby? üòÖ"

846,venue cancels gig because of no reservations beforehand,36,musicians,99,"hi,

so I've been organizing gigs for my band for a while now (we are still very unknown but do our best to play as much as possible wherever we can) and twice now I've had venues postponing/canceling gigs because no reservations were made by people beforehand.

the first time that that happened wasn't actually bad - they hit us up and asked if we and the other bands could shift the date to a few months later and then we played that gig. easy.

now, however, the venue in question is further away in a town where we don't know anybody. what's even weirder is that the organizer wrote that they love having small bands from outside of town playing there because of the diversity etc etc - in my first email I also immediately made clear that we are a 90min drive away from them and don't have any connections to there. anyways, their quasi sound guy just wrote me and was like ""well if you dont bring x amount of people we're gonna cancel the gig, sorry""

is it just me or is that actually a bit weird/shitty?

  
EDIT: it's also important to note that we have been advertising this gig for weeks while the venue itself hasn't posted about it once - their advertising is ""well, it's in our calendar"""
847,Is helping someone tune their instrument a way of insulting someone?,39,musicians,123,"Last night I had a show with my band. 

Before we got on, one of the bands who went on before offered to tune my drums. 

They started tuning, touching the drums, tapping the cymbals, and talking about how the drums sounded in front of me. 

Overall, it felt like I was back in music school with teachers telling me what I did wrong and it made me self conscious, especially since I just replaced and tuned the heads. 

It kind of felt like their way of making me feel less than, as though I don‚Äôt know as much about drums as the other bands. 

Is this something people do to fuck with you or..what? I‚Äôm still self conscious about what happened the next day"
848,The room I performed in today sounded amazing.,38,musicians,9,"I performed at a wedding today. I‚Äôve performed at many weddings at various locations. I‚Äôve experienced many types of room sounds from bad to meh to decent to neutral. You just have to work with what you get and make it sound as best you can. 

Well today, the room that I was in today sounded incredible. I strummed a simple C major chord with a G in the bass and was utterly shocked at how good it sounded. 

In fact it sounded so good that I felt inspired. I didn‚Äôt just want to get through the gig. I was looking forward to every note and chord. 

It was so hard to believe that I turned off the reverb on my amp. It made no difference. I even turned off my amp and my classical guitar still sounded wonderful just with less volume. 

It was an unmistakable reminder that there is amazing beauty in even the slightest of musical experiences. Sometimes a C chord played well on a great sounding instrument in a great sounding room can be a rich, fulfilling and more satisfying experience than you thought it could be."
849,Didn‚Äôt realize we were renting the venue. What if I don‚Äôt pay,36,musicians,155,"So I advertised on a subreddit ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a new band, never played a show with this project, but if you need a last second opener we can help‚Äù.

A band got back to me and asked us if we wanted to play a gig in 25 days, they already booked it, but needed ppl to open for them. We agreed, and we didnt ask about pay because we were just happy to be playing. 

Then the venue stopped responding to the headliner for like one and a half weeks, the headliner couldn‚Äôt ask for questions, even said he doesn‚Äôt know if the shows gonna happen. The venue finally got back to us a week before the show and in that info sheet it said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt generate $150 from ticket/drink sales, you are responsible for paying the rest‚Äù. 

We didn‚Äôt mind not getting paid, but having to pay at the end would be fucked. If we end up not selling $150, who should be responsible? The headliner that booked the show without openers? Or all of us?

What if we didn‚Äôt pay the venue if they try to charge us?"

Any time we're discussing the song form, orchestration, chords, etc. they're over in the corner just tinkering away, totally oblivious, usually blasting the volume with the amp on the floor pointed at their feet and towards everyone that's trying to talk. I feel like I'm constantly yelling at them to just chill for a minute so we can figure out the song. Then a second later they're picking again thinking it's somehow quieter.

We played a few shows in 2020/21 but this year it really ramped up we played bar gigs and a few small venues every weekend from may-oct. We have only put out one song and written one more in the last year. 3 of us are in college and working and our singer/guitarist is only working. Our singer loves playing shows more than anything. He says it's the only fun he has. But I'm in college now and we're still playing almost every weekend and I'm burnt out. We've played the same set, at the same bar to the same people for almost 5 months and I'm seriously sick of it. I'm tired of the late nights and the cost to get out there. It wasn't so bad during the summer because I could sleep in when the shows mess up my schedule but now I can't because I have school at 930 on Monday mornings. I've told them that I couldn't play shows after school starts but our singer still books them. I had to force them to pull out of a show that was already in between two other weekends with gigs. It's taken a real toll on me and I don't really enjoy being in the band anymore. It feels like we've gone stale because I want to write and record. Especially because I'm going to audio school, but we don't have time to write and record together because of our schedules and then shows when we're free. I've tried telling them I want to stop but they refuse saying that we need to stay relevant and this is the only way to do it. I'm considering leaving because I can't do it anymore. What should I do or how could I convince them to take an actual break?

TLDR: Played bar gigs all summer now I'm in school, burnt out and want a break to write and record, yet my band refuses."

869,[Discussion] What is the toxic trait that kills any band/project?,36,musicians,48,"I‚Äôll start.

I was asked by a couple of childhood friends to join their band. We had always dreamed of finally jamming together professionally and even better that this band had a record label supporting them. So I joined, hadn‚Äôt joined before when they first started since I had another project I was working on. Immediately after finally WORKING with my childhood friends did I start seeing their work ethic. One was too strung up on the drugs and focused on scoring daily while on tour with a wife back home and the other was so talented (ambitious?) that he was constantly trying out for bigger bands every chance he got behind our and the labels back. The whole band in general had a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre the best musicians in the state (for this specific genre) and we‚Äôre gonna blow up and do drugs and be better than everyone else‚Äù 

As soon as I joined I saw no professionalism from anybody, pure individualism. Me having plenty of experience working with team members and strategizing in a professional environment, I did the best I could to try to get everyone on the same page. The band imploded, too many extremes for everyone to get along and I was caught in the middle of everything. Eventually the label ditched everyone after many egotistical issues and confrontations between the members and kept me as admin for insider help with their next projects. To this day I keep very little contact with my childhood friends sadly. 

What are your experiences?"

871,Need to vent: Getting screwed over as a musician,36,musicians,25,"My band and I have a residency with a newly established bar and music venue. We are a newly established band ourselves, so we took on this residency as a way of refining our live performance and getting a fanbase started. 

From the start, we weren't promised payment but we were promised a PWYC bucket to be passed around where the proceeds would go to us, as well a free drink and discounted food of the menu. 

The first few weeks we didn't pass a bucket because the crowds were too small.  We enjoyed our free beer in the meantime. We started making some money at other gigs so it wasn't important to us. 

We found out more recently the establishment is having some financial difficulties. For this reason, they have stopped the free drinks and discounted food for the artists because they were losing revenue. 

At our last gig, the audience was large and the place was hoppin. We saw the event manager passing around a PWYC bucket. My band and I were stoked to finally be making a little cash. 

HOWEVER, I learned that the bucket was actually for ""donations"" where the proceeds would be going back to the bar and NOT the artists. 

I know from experience and from other friends that artists are often taken advantage of and I'm getting really sick of it. I know it's hard in the city for businesses to succeed but it shouldn't be done on the backs of artists that aren't being fairly compensated."

And I figured that the rules have changed so much in the last 7 years, that a young person (such as I am; 24 y/o) may actually have more of an insight to the inner working of leveraging digital in music than my esteemed predecessors. I realized that if you are serious about finding success in this crazy industry - *as a musician, manager, booking agent, publicist, business manager, promoter, etc* \- you MUST stay educated about the modern practices of successful artists. We must use these new technique to build our dreams (*which, for me is to tour professionally as a freelance bass player*). So, while I was touring in 2018 I wrote a book about it. Since then I recorded an audio-experience/version of the book, which I am releasing today! It contains 5+ hours of Music Industry information and is almost 1 year in the making.

These episodes are available on **Spotify** and **Apple Podcasts**, as well as 8 other platforms.

This audio series explores 4 concepts:

* ***Publicity***
* ***Marketing***
* ***Touring***
* ***Album Release***

It covers basic music industry topics like **Record Deals**, **Copyright**, **Royalties**, and the **Responsibilities of Industry Professionals**, as well as more advanced topics like:

* *Actually making money*
* *Attracting Press and Publicity*
* *Facebook and Snapchat Advertising*
* *High-Quality Digital Content*
* *Paying Taxes*
* *Attracting a Booking Agent*
* *Advanced Marketing*
* *Landing Pages & Fan Funnels*
* *Branding*
* *Modern day Touring*
* *Album Release Digital PR Campaign*
* and seriously so so so much more.

I wrote, produced, and narrated this audio series by myself, and I'm sure I went a little crazy doing it. I'm so happy to release the darn thing. I frequently browsed Reddit, searching through forums like this one to find music industry related questions. Hopefully, I have presented this information in a way that will help answer those questions, and many more.

This Audio-Series is dedicated to all the teachers in my life. May it inspire you as they have inspired me!

874,Earplugs During a Concert (Rant),35,musicians,34,"I'm sick of hearing how wearing earplugs is ""lame"" or ""not metal enough"" when attending a concert, especially when you are up close to the stage.

Where did this even come from?

As a musician, my ears would be ringing for days until I started plugging up, especially during practice. It has been an amazing help and I feel like I am nowhere near tinnitus.

Yet I talk to so many guys that just accept ringing and permanent damage like it's a ""badge of honor."" It could be one of the stupidest decisions of your life especially if you are exposed to loud music frequently.

I've gotten a bunch of people over the years to wear plugs and they thank me for it. Others just go ""meh"" I'll deal with it later and sometimes I can even tell they have experienced what might be permanent hearing loss.

Yeah, it sucks that sometimes you can't hear the full spectrum but if you by the right kind of musician's earplugs, it actually works well and takes away the pounding. Example this page talks about it: [Prevent Tinnitus at a Gig](https://concertear.com/ears-ringing-after-concert/)

Or, you should simply where the plugs for some songs and maybe take them out for others, but overall I feel like they are usually necessary unless you are way in the back.

So what's the reason people are so against earplugs in many cases? Does it come down to the fact that they simply need to hear everything no matter what? A lot of old heads regret not doing it, guys in their 50s+ that never plugged up. I hear tons of horror stories..."

876,Five Ways to Sabotage Your Own Band,35,musicians,28,"**Five Ways to Sabotage Your Own Band**

*By. T. Perry Bowers* 

I have a little over twenty rehearsal spaces in my facility in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota. The average turnover on my monthlies is about one per month. Bands are required to give me thirty days notice when they want to move out of their space. Receiving that phone call is always interesting \- I‚Äôm concerned about the way people experience my business, so I‚Äôll ask them why they are moving. *\(I really want to know if it had anything to do with me\).* Nine times out of ten the reason is internal difficulties within the band. Here are some of the reasons I hear ‚Äì just a few of the many ways artists sabotage their own band.

**Drugs/Alcohol**

It‚Äôs a creative endeavor being in a band. Creative people like things that inspire them and make the creative juices flow. Drugs do this. Sure, it‚Äôs an easy way to get into the creative mood. Just take a drug and suddenly you want to be at practice. You want to write a song and spend five hours working on a riff. The problem is that drugs wear off. And when the drugs wear off, you are moody, sick and tired. 

I watch guys come to their practice spaces with a ton of beer. It‚Äôs one thing to have a six\-pack. It‚Äôs another to bring in a few cases. I have a couple of bands that fill the trash cans outside their room with beer bottles every time they practice. They practice for a couple of hours at a time. I‚Äôve been outside their rooms across the hall for their entire practice. After about an hour, the quality of their rehearsal is significantly reduced. They play poorly. They take long breaks and talk about non\-music things. Then, they literally come out of their practice space stumbling. Those bands aren‚Äôt going anywhere. 

**Not Prioritizing Music**

My band Silverseed has been looking for a permanent bass player for most of the time we have been a band! Sometimes bands are like that. One position just isn‚Äôt solid. I‚Äôve come to terms with it and I am grateful for the members that are committed. Eventually we‚Äôll find the right bass player, but for now, we get to experience a new guy every few shows. It‚Äôs interesting; the excuses people give to not show up to practice. At first glance, they seem legitimate. Their kids, wives, or parents spring something on them and they feel obligated. ‚ÄúEmergencies‚Äù like ‚Äúmy insurance adjuster needs to come and look at my roof today‚Äù happen. Or, ‚ÄúI need to get my oil changed‚Äù. Yeah, I‚Äôve heard that one, too. It‚Äôs almost as bad as the classic, ‚ÄúI need to wash my hair!‚Äù

The point is that if music isn‚Äôt top of your list, then you‚Äôre going to have a difficult time making progress. Girlfriends will constantly pull you in different directions. Your kid‚Äôs baseball games will sometimes be scheduled during band practice. Your friend‚Äôs birthday party will interfere too. But, if you make music a priority and the people in your life who are important to you know that your music time is off limits, you won‚Äôt have to constantly negotiate. Your loved ones will know not to mess with your band stuff. It might seem juvenile coming from a forty\-five year old man who still has a rock band, but it‚Äôs what makes me happy. And, for other parts of my life to be good, I need my musical life to thrive. If I can‚Äôt make music on the regular, you might as well put me in the ground because life just isn‚Äôt worth living without rock and roll, right?

**Self\-Doubt**

You need a certain degree of confidence when it comes to making music. But there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Confidence is speaking up when you know something isn‚Äôt right. When it comes to song\-writing I know how the song needs to go, but I didn‚Äôt always have the courage to tell my band mates how I wanted them to play it. I know what turns the audience off, but self\-doubt sometimes stopped me speaking to band mates to tell them to stop doing certain things on\-stage. However I‚Äôm over most of that now. I will usually speak my mind. That comes from self\-confidence gained over the years. However you have to be tactful when presenting your idea \- which leads me to the next way to sabotage your band:

**Not Having Finesse**

I‚Äôve lost band mates over the years by being too blunt! Often, I regret the things I say. I‚Äôve spent many months searching for drummers and bass players because I lost band members due to something I said. Sometimes things do need to be said, but if possible, take a breath before you do something inflammatory. Being in a band requires perspective. Think of all the bands that are no longer together because of petty disagreements. Before saying or doing something rash, take a moment \(or a week\) to appreciate what you have. It‚Äôs a rare thing to have four or five guys playing in a band together and getting on. Don‚Äôt take it for granted. When you do need to confront an issue, use finesse. 

**Not Having Direction**

There are a lot of ambitious bands out there. Some spend hours on social media promoting themselves every day. There are songwriters who wake up before you to go into the studio to craft a hit song. No matter how hard you think you work, there are people in New York and Los Angeles that would put your work ethic to shame. On the other hand, there are the bands who think all they have to do is look good and play a show once in a while and everything will be handed to them. Don‚Äôt be that band. Take control of your career from the beginning. Decide where you want to be and how you‚Äôre going to get there. 

Be creative with your songwriting and with your business. Look for new ways to get your name out there and bring in revenue. Keep thinking about how to get your band in front of new people and capture their contact info while you‚Äôre in front of them. Be smart, be creative and be relentless.  And don‚Äôt sabotage your own band!

879,How do you handle the tip jar in a hired gun situation?,35,musicians,55,"I've been playing with a cover band for the past year, and everything has been going great.  The gigs are regular, and the pay is decent.  The best part is I don't have to do anything - the band leader books all the gigs, does all the marketing, and even sets up and tears down the bulk of the gear - I only have to worry about my guitar and amp.

Given all that the band leader does, I don't expect to be paid an equal share of the profits, I see myself as more of an employee.  I don't care that he pockets all the money for merch, and I don't even care if what he's paying me is less than an equal cut of the gig proceeds.

But the tip jar somehow feels different, like he should be giving us an equal split of that money.  I know he probably has costs like web hosting and other marketing materials that the tip jar probably helps cover, but it feels like the whole band earns those tips based on our performance and engagement with people on and off stage.

For others who are in hired gun situations, how does your band handle the tip jar?"

882,Former band member wants their part taken out of recordings.,35,musicians,112,"We recently recorded, mixed and mastered some music.  It's going to be released soon, like a couple weeks.  This member did some things that made the band kick them out.  The ousted member demanded that their part be taken out of the finished recordings.  Are we obliged to do this? I want to get the part removed to be over and done with it, but it's going to severely effect the quality of this release. Does anyone know the legality or have advice on this?

UPDATE: I decided to try and remove the parts.  I don't feel obliged, since the former member was being extremely petty, but I think their pettiness will continue in other ways.  I just want to be done with them.
 I explained the situation to the studio who did the mixing and they'll fix it for free today (very nice of them). Luckily it's easy to remove and wasn't integral to the songs, just soundscapes. The studio is going to talk to the mastering company on our behalf to see if we can get a similar deal with them.  
This may delay the digital release but we'll do some physical copies so we have something to provide for our release show that we've already been planning for many months. 


Update 2: I was able to get to studio to remove the part and remix the songs, and the remastering was also done.  It looks like we'll make our timberline for our release! On a crappier note, the former member is harassing abs threatening us.  Had to buy home security :(.

Thanks for the advice everybody!"
883,I and many others have had unreleased songs stolen by a guy under the name Flash Sendric.,37,musicians,30,"I wanted to spread the word and hopefully get in touch with people who have also been negatively impacted by Flash Sendric.

I've been enveloped in this nightmare involving an individual by the name of Flash Sendric combing through innocent music feedback Discord servers (and likely other places) and stealing unreleased/unfinished work from unsuspecting up-and-coming musicians, including myself. I've been in touch with a few others who have also fallen victim to Flash Sendric's schemes. What was once a fun way to communicate with other musicians turned into a seemingly irreversible mess that I'm struggling to clean up. The damage this guy has done to me and many others has been devastating. I can barely eat or sleep, I feel so violated and humiliated that this person swiped something I poured my heart and soul into without my consent and is making money off of me. I've been filing copyright claims and sending emails left and right, but have yet to see the work he stole from me and others taken down.

It's tricky because this person takes things and releases them before you do, under your nose. I do feel very bad for having shared my unreleased music to anyone, that is where I admittedly went wrong - the Internet is the Wild West and I've learned my lesson - but that doesn't make this person's actions justifiable, and they need to be held accountable and stopped.

This all appears to be financially driven behavior. What I've learned is that Flash Sendric will steal unreleased music and put it through different distribution services. Because they are unreleased works, they slip under the radar and are released under every platform. To get views, he adds other popular artists in the credits which places the songs in the public eye. Flash Sendric has made a pretty penny off me this way...

If anyone has any information on this person please don't hesitate to comment. I'm not afraid to take legal action if it comes down to it and every voice affected by this person needs to be heard for the sake of all artists.

Thank you."

887,Band Member has been slacking,37,musicians,33,"First off I want to say that our guitar player is awesome and hes a huge part of our band. However, he's the youngest in our group and lately I feel like his lack of maturity has really been showing. On Saturday we were playing a tailgate and we started playing at 1 pm. At 12:30, we had no idea where he was. His phone was going to straight to voicemail, and according to his friends, they had last seen him absolutley shit faced at 5 am. Thankfully he showed up in time, but for a hot second we were seriously considering cancelling the show as we were all standing on stage and we were set up. We don't have any written expectations as far as call time before a show, but we all agreed that he was in the wrong. Additionally, we have regular Sunday rehearsals,  2 of the past 3 Sundays he has not shown. The most previous one he straight up didn't tell us until 30 minutes after it stared that he was in another city. 2 weeks prior he called 30 minutes before rehearsal ended that he had just woken up, and was very hungover. 

I feel like this needs to be addressed but since we don't have a clear band contract I'm not sure how to broach this. I also feel like most of my bandmates agree with me, but I don't want to go explicitly behind his back to address this with them. What do I do going forward?"

889,How to tell my drummer he keeps overplaying?,34,musicians,75,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I just have a question. 

My band plays like 90‚Äôs-2000s esque alt rock music (think Smashing Pumpkins, very early Coldplay, Oasis). Our drummer is great and super talented, but the only issue I have is he overplays every song. He can‚Äôt go more than two measures without putting some crazy fill in. They don‚Äôt serve the songs and with me playing bass and writing the songs he ends up changing grooves and putting in these crazy new fills in every time we practice and it‚Äôs become very hard to predict what he‚Äôs going to do to try and time hits with him because he‚Äôs constantly changing the grooves and again throwing fills in random parts of the song. I feel like his playing isn‚Äôt serving the songs and he‚Äôs over compensating for not practicing by trying to show off the whole song. 

Sorry that was a bit of a rant. I just want to find a way to tell him that him throwing fills in everywhere and changing up his playing every time we practice isn‚Äôt serving the music, I just don‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings or come off the wrong way because he really is a great drummer and I know he can play the songs. 

I guess my question is if someone in your band were to say this to you how would you want to hear it? Again I don‚Äôt want to hurt his feelings or come off like I don‚Äôt appreciate his playing or think he‚Äôs not a good drummer. I just need him to play more consistently and in a way that serves the songs like everyone else is."
890,my band thinks photos are corny,36,musicians,52,"Ive been in this band for a year now, and we've played shows, we got a decent thing going.

She heard a song I uploaded and decided that it was unfair for me to write it. Her main point was that supposedly it made me sound like a victim when I was the one who broke up with her. The thing is that, while though inspired by some feelings from the relationship,  it's about a lot of things. It stays pretty vague. It doesn't directly use her name or anyone's, it's just generally a song about growing apart from someone and realizing you are both giving eachother less and less. I feel that is completely fair to write, especially if I'm not making any announcements that it came from a particular situation. And ultimately it's art- if all the words and music are my own, nobody should be able to tell me not to play it at my shows or have a recording up online. 

Am I missing anything here? This caught me completely off guard. And I'm wondering if any other songwriters have dealt with external pressure to stop playing songs."

I'm a 28 year old male and I've played left-handed guitar since I was 12. Last year I was diagnosed with cancer in the form of a sarcoma on my right riffing hand. 

The cancer made it clear that they need to cut off, my pinky finger, ring finger and initially the middle finger but that was saved. What remains is my thumb, pointer and middle.

This gutted me but I've come to terms. I was literally about to get on my first album, and also had another opportunity with an eagles tribute band to tour a couple countries for the first time. But this sarcoma ruined all that, and my dream.

However I'm a fighter and decided I may try to re-learn guitar right handed. My question is; since I've played for years left handed, will learning right handed come easier? Or do I need to put in the years all over again? 

Thanks for reading. Much love."

910,Why can‚Äôt I get gigs anymore? Is it because of my personality and music taste? ,34,musicians,98,"Hi all,
So, to start out with: I‚Äôve been playing guitar, gigging, and writing songs since I was 10 years old. I later learned drums, keyboards, and bass.  I‚Äôm 19 now. I‚Äôm a massive fan of alternative/indie rock, folk rock, and psychedelic rock. My favorite bands are Wilco, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Big Star, The Beach Boys, The Doors, Pavement, Elliott Smith, etc. 
 I live in Dadeville, AL, which is a small town in basically the middle of nowhere. The closest town is Auburn, AL, and we all know what that‚Äôs known for (War Eagle)! 
 I play open mics sometimes over at venues over there, and the audience somewhat accepts me. 
The main scene around here is country and pop. I don‚Äôt want to play what I don‚Äôt want to play. Plus, I sound horrible when I attempt country or pop. I have Asperger syndrome, and a bit of an eccentric/socially awkward personality. I‚Äôm kind of on the hippie/a little flamboyant edge in the way I dress on stage, though I often dress like your stereotypical college history or art professor when I‚Äôm not on stage. 
My voice is also not what would be considered a ‚Äúgreat singer.‚Äù I can‚Äôt sing very loud unless I scream, and I sound like a combination of Neil Young, Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, John Lennon, and possibly even Daniel Johnston. I have a very nasal and ‚Äúwhiny‚Äù voice with a weird rounded/deep undertone due to my baritone/tenor range. 
I have a small cult following, and some of my heroes have heard my songs before and showed appreciation for them. However, no one wants to book me, and I have only a few monthly listeners on Spotify. 
What should I do to start getting out there and gigging again? I haven‚Äôt had a paid gig in two years because I went into reclusion for a while due to a decline in my mental state and I started at a community college. 
The next paid gig I have is on April 13 with my friend, who I have a duo project with. We get along great and have very similar music taste. Should I try to start gigging in a bigger city (which is farther away for sure) where I might have a more diverse audience? 
Peace out,
Ryan "

921,"Wondering about becoming more serious as a musician later in life. Don't need it for the money, but I'm in a place where I can really play music just for me.",36,musicians,53,"This may be a silly question for here...

I'm 30. I have light musical experience; been playing a decade +, vocals and guitar, but only jammed with friends in college (for girls, lol), or did open mics solo, or now mostly drop in with my GF's family and friends or at bluegrass festivals and drop in with strangers occasionally (GF's family plays a LOT of this stuff, fun, but not my scene to play).

I'm at a weird phase in my life.. I'm a doctor, and I make enough money in 3 months to cover my yearly bills (I'm very frugal; Live and travel out of my RV), and I don't have to work more than that if I don't want, although the jobs are all over the country, so I'm on the road when I am working (US). But I'm not satisfied with it.

I'm thinking the optional-at-least 6 months of downtime I have per year is a good place to restart that passion. And I'm kinda in a place where I can do it not for girls or for money... But just for me. Which feels good for me.

I'm wondering where I get started and talking this more seriously. I don't even need it to be profitable. Just have fun with it. Polish myself enough that I'm comfortable playing some local bars or any that I travel to when I'm on contract, etc. Either solo or with band.

Posting this on a throwaway because my real bandmates follow my account and I just need to vent about it for a minute. Also, this is a pretty long fucking thread so If you really care about what I have to say, please do so. And also If this isn‚Äôt allowed, I will gladly delete.

in 2020, I started a solo garage punk project during quarantine. In 2021 I was able to turn that solo project into a three piece band with my friends from high school. We‚Äôve been going for about 8 months now and we‚Äôve become pretty well known and respected in our scene and have played shows with some very amazing people. We put out an EP and an album and have another album on the way that was all home recorded by me. But within those 8 short months, playing with these guys has started to take a toll on me emotionally and mentally and has made me want to quit music and playing shows altogether because they are real douchebags.

My main problem is the drummer. At first, I thought he was really cool because he‚Äôs a good drummer and he‚Äôs the only drummer in town that I know of. But recently, he‚Äôs started to have a really bad ego problem after we won a local battle of the bands. His oversized ego has led him to back out of any show that aren‚Äôt paying over $300 and he flat out refuses to play shows friends of ours are putting on because he wants us to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù and ‚Äúbe famous‚Äù and often complains when I don‚Äôt wanna put up with his bullshit. Because of this, we‚Äôre slowly becoming disliked in the scene and seen as flakers by a few venue owners. To give you an example, we‚Äôve been forced to back out of 8 different shows because of our drummer.

He also has a tendency to not take responsibility when he damages his kit and instead chooses to put the blame on me because he leaves his kit at my house for practice. Few Examples: blaming a broken hi hat on me when he dropped them during load up after a show, blaming me for his snare head ring coming loose after he was careless during another show (it was a shitty remo head). He often tells his lies to other musicians in our scene which makes me look like a dumb careless singer and I have gotten some shit for it.

Our bassist isn‚Äôt a huge problem, I get along with him better than our drummer, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he has his problems either. The main problem is that he has a tendency to be extremely rude to other musicians and bands from our scene. Often disrespecting other bands for no real reason. He also has an ego problem like our drummer and thinks he‚Äôs a better bass player than anybody else in the scene. But my major problem that I‚Äôve had to constantly check him for is his tendency to make really insensitive and very unfunny ‚Äújokes‚Äù about other musicians. The worst was when he made ‚Äújokes‚Äù about killing members of other bands he didn‚Äôt like.

One thing they both collectively share, is that they only care about making money with the band, the only questions that seem to ask me at shows is how much the venues gonna pay us or how much we‚Äôre getting in donations and get really mad when we make less than $100. Me personally, I don‚Äôt give a shit about money because all I care about is playing shows for people who like my bands music and with bands that I really love and respect.

Another thing is that they‚Äôre extremely ungrateful to people who try and help us out. The prize for the battle of the bands contest that we won is a free studio session at a well respected recording studio (which would cost $2,000). I was pretty excited but the band wasn‚Äôt, they were mad that they didn‚Äôt win money or anything like that. Example 2: a musician I‚Äôve been good friends with for years wants to get us a set of speakers, subwoofers, and stage monitors because I intend to start hosting DIY shows for local bands and artists. Instead, they were mad that they weren‚Äôt getting new guitars, Amps and drum kits. Instead, they told me that I should just sell the equipment so I can buy them new gear.

One more rant is about how they always complain to me about how our new songs should sound but they never take the time write their own riffs, drum parts, and lyrics, and whatever material they do give me, it‚Äôs stolen from other bands. Yes you heard that right, even though I have a band with me who claim to be very creative people, They instead leave me to do all of the writing for them while they just sit on their asses all day. I‚Äôve tried telling them off a few times but it always results in them blaming me for not being communicative (our drummer doesn‚Äôt have a working phone number, a Facebook, and his only contact is instagram which he barely uses). 

I‚Äôm just really fucking frustrated with these absolute douchebags because when I started this band, I just wanted to have fun with my friends and play shows with fellow bands that I love and respect from my scene and slowly overtime build up our reputation and begin a tour within the surrounding states, but because of them and their constant monetary demands, they want a tour starting within January of next year despite both of them still being in high school, neither of us having licenses, and not even having a vehicle to transport us in.

Again, I‚Äôm sorry if this is really long, I just need to vent my frustrations to any musicians who understand my pain. If you have any advice on what to do, please tell me, if you want to critique me go right ahead, because I know I‚Äôm not a perfect bastard either."

It feels great to be a part of good music but if that‚Äôs all I get in return while these artists enjoy extra benefits then I think it‚Äôs somewhat unfair.

971,AITA for leaving a band after saying I wouldn't?,32,musicians,35,"context: I (F17) joined a band a year and a half ago with two guys 40M and 50M. I was already a fan of the music and the leader/writer, lets call him Jim, was a friend of my parent and I had known him a while. They needed a keyboardist and I was eager to join so I asked, he said he wasn't sure as I'm in college and might be unreliable but I assured him it's no issue.

a few months in, we're gigging a bit and getting some attention. Jim has 'been in the industry' a long time and already had a lot of connections to labels, promoters, etc, or that's at least what he claimed. I started to notice that as I knew him better he was pretty arrogant and would be constantly name dropping, clearly trying to make me impressed or starstruck. he would also talk about all his label connections yet never offer to forward me an email, pass on one of my CDs (I make my own music) or anything and I really felt like he was only mentioning this stuff to maintain some influence. he also got comfortable mansplaining basically every part of the music making process to me, explaining my own synthesisers, explaining why he's a better sound engineer than the guy I'm paying to master my album. he would put down most music I said I liked or tried to share, he would bitch about all the other musicians in our town (it's not a big place). he just got on my nerves and I was thinking of quitting.

I guess they must've sensed this after we played a festival and although I was there with them the whole day we performed, did everything I should've, wasn't rude etc, I went off and did my own things seeing the bands I was into on the other days. after the festival I got a text asking if I was 'in the band 100%' because I didn't hang out with them, but honestly Jim never felt like a genuine friend not even due to the age gap but because he gave off such egotistical vibes. so I sad yeah, sadly I don't think it's working but I was grateful for the experience and wish them luck blah blah blah.

now I've heard through mutual friend of mine and Jims that he's been bitching about me to other musicians in town, saying I 'flaked' and I'm 'not ready to commit to music' which is not true, as I've almost finished my exams and I'm still gigging consistently and focussed on music as well as another band I've joined. I was also acquainted with a local label through Jim, and I've been talking to them about releasing my stuff with them but since Jim's band has signed to them they've just stopped being interested so I'm assuming he's said something. I was also acquainted with a popular radio DJ (in person) who said I should get in contact with but now Jims withholding his email address so I can't.

it just felt totally unfair that he was trying to inconvenience my music career and slander me to every music-related connection in the area. but now I'm guessing the reason is that I said I was committed and then left the band after about 10 months. should I phone him up and reassure him its not because of college, because I'm flakey, because I have better things to do, but because he's insufferable???

I‚Äôve seen two major categories and everything in between - it‚Äôs newbies and guys with some experience in the past. Neither of both categories are capable of showing any promising results. It‚Äôs a bummer that I usually can't even see musicians playing their instruments or having at least something to listen. And usually if there is, this is 100% mediocrity due to lack of skill or taste.

I just can‚Äôt find people to make music with. I want to believe in people especially if they‚Äôre lack of skill, but I just can‚Äôt deal with this always at ease behaviour, absence of effort and casual ""looking for jams"".

One of the reasons why I keep looking and still not doing everything myself - I just need help. I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôm very talented or anything, but when it comes to music I‚Äôm doing, it‚Äôs a real struggle for one person. I actually kind of doing everything myself right now, but to get equally good at all the instruments, songwriting and sound takes a lot of time and I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and even burned out fair amount of that time.

I currently live in a major city in Canada where there‚Äôs no shortage of musicians. I constantly search on craigslist, bandmix and sometimes try luck with facebook and reddit.

992,First time ever getting goosebumps while playing,35,musicians,10,"So, I don't know why I'm so surprised by what happened just now, but I am and I'm really curious to know if others can relate to this:

I've been playing guitar ever since I got my first guitar when I was about 7 y/o and started singing when I was about 12 y/o. Music for me has always been a way to cope with a lot of shit I experienced, and like many other musicians it's my way to express myself.

But music to me was always just a way to cope and express, and I never really liked hearing myself play because I always lacked confidence. I did perform a lot these past years; but that's more because other people told me they really liked my music and wanted me to play, so I told myself to get over my anxieties and just play, still not enjoying my own music.

But the weirdest thing happened today. I was rehearsing for a gig I have tomorrow, and while I was playing I got goosebumps all over my body and I almost got a bit emotional (in a good way) by the music I was playing. I never experienced this before. I did recognise a kind of 'getting emotional' I used to have, but that never was a good feeling. That always felt more like embarrassment and wanting to disappear rather than getting goosebumps from joy.

Past 1,5 year I did work a lot on mental health issues I used to have, and maybe this is just step closer to getting some healthy confidence. 
But I was so surprised by this feeling and I want to know if other people ever experienced something like that, and if making music (or expressing in another way) changed after that. 

I hope I don't sound like I'm looking for attention, because that's not my goal at all. I'm just really curious and a bit overwhelmed.

Cheers!"

I have also rarely played for other people, the very few times I did waaay back in my teens, I regretted sorely cuz all I heard was how nobody knew the songs I knew how to play, they were too slow/too boring/too downbeat, too whatever, people fidgeting two stanzas down the line, awkward curtesy at the end, an unpleasant situation for both parts. Fair enough, nobody has to like the same things as me, I'll keep my music to myself, we're all good. With the years I ended up with a very solid repertoire on my lap (I have easily lost sight of 2h+ just singing and playing, I really enjoy doing it) but that was just it: me and the guitar and silence in the room. 

A month or so ago, there's this couple I'm friends with, they're moving to the city to start gradschool, the two of them crash on my couch while they spend 4 long days looking for apts to rent and getting the feel for the districts, and so on. I was very pleased to have them here and help out with tips and tricks, they're both a pleasure to be around. On their last day I find out one of them used to be in a band, so I say there's a guitar in my room if they feel like playing something to kill the last few minutes before they go catch their train. Sure, why not!, the conversation gears towards cool indie bands and shitty venues to play at in their city. Then the unavoidable question comes: do you play the guitar too? I'm feeling comfortable around those two people, end up disclosing that I do, and so we pass the guitar back and forth playing cool pieces to each other, barely knowing the other's songs so no singing along but whatever, music is music. Then we stop, they have to go or they'll miss the train. Thanks a lot, when we come back here and settle down in our new apartment, you have to come over for us to play together some other time, this was really cool.

It was really cool, really exciting and fun, I would love to do that again. But something happened that night and it's been bugging me ever since, to the extent that I came all the way to write this post: I simply don't feel like I did half justice to my skills on that night, as compared to when I'm alone. Weak fingers, fumbling fingerpicking, shaky and low voice, hurried past some songs, didn't take the time for the outro, weird stuff like that that, again, pays no justice to the extent of my abilities. It was bitterly frustrating in a way, and I want to do something about it, because to me it feels like a crying shame that I can't honour (almost like?) this thing that sustained me for so long is just badly presented. Been really bugged and bewildered lately. 

Anyone out there willing to empathise with this random stranger and offer their two cents of wisdom? Would appreciate a lot. Have a nice day if you reached this line ;-)"

# How to Book Your Show: Hold, Challenge, and Confirm

When asking a venue promoter about booking a show, the conversation goes like this:

### Hold

A ‚Äú**Hold**‚Äù is a verbal confirmation that the band would like to perform on an available date. The venue promoter will distribute holds on a first-come-first-serve basis.

If an agent wants to book a date at a venue to perform, the agent emails the promoter and asks for a hold on an available date. If another Agent for another band wants the date, that agent asks for a ‚Äú2nd Hold‚Äù, or a ‚Äú3rd Hold‚Äù, and so on. This process continues until an artist or agent decides to confirm their Hold or is challenged by someone else for the show.

It is not uncommon for a perfect weekend run of 2nd or 3rd holds to be ruined by an early challenger. For this reason, agents often have several holds in different markets or venues to safeguard their existing routing and to make sure the band can hit crucial markets. Sometimes the booking agent will even ask to hold multiple dates at the same venue. This happens when a band knows they want to play in a certain market (lets say, Atlanta), but they are not sure which date will work better for their routing or turnout.

When a booking agent is ready to confirm a show, the Agent will confirm/challenge a ***run*** (*shows in succession*) of holds at once with the promoters.

### Challenge

‚ÄúChallenge‚Äù is the process of forcing the other holds on a date to confirm or back out within 24 or 48 hours of the challenge being issued.

For example: A booking agent with a 2nd Hold may Challenge an agent with a 1st hold for a date at a venue if they are ready to commit to a contract. Upon being issued a Challenge, the promoter of the show will give the agent with a 1st hold a 48 hour window of committing to the show or backing out.

If you have a 5th hold on the venues and you issue a challenge on the other holds, the promoter emails the other 4 holds and says ‚ÄúYour hold has been challenged, do you want to confirm?‚Äù

### Confirm

A ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù is the verbal agreement that you intend to sign a performance contract and commit to a performance date and deal with a venue promoter.

## What happens if you back out of a Confirm?

Legally & financially, nothing happens. You have not signed a Performance Contract that would obligate the artist and promoter to certain terms if the show doesn‚Äôt happen. However, I highly advise to never back out of a confirm outside of an **Act of God** (known legally as a ‚Äú***force majeure***‚Äù). The confirm is only a courtesy in legal terms, but it has a social weight‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääan obligation that you intend to sign a contract and bring legal and financial consequences to the performance.

The music industry is a small world, which means that word travels fast, especially among Promoters. So while you technically have not invoked the ***cancellation clause*** of a performance contract, that promoter might hold a grudge against you behind closed doors. A promoter will not go out of their way to bash the reputation of an artist that pulls out of a ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù, but as an agent you are putting yourself into a serious disadvantage when trying to perform in that market again.

Now, if the show is 4 months away and you pull out of a confirm because of some foreseeable event (wedding, birth of a child, double booking, etc), there is a reasonable amount of time for the promoter to find a new artist that night. But obviously, this is an inconvenience that everyone wants to avoid.

# Know Your Deals

### Guarantee

This is a Flat Fee that is guaranteed to the artist no matter the venue income (*tickets sold*) or expenses (*production, marketing, security*) related to the show.

### Door Deal

This is a % of the money made at the door via Ticket Sales. If you have an **80% Door Deal** and sell $150 worth of tickets, you will walk out with $120.

### Versus Deal

This is a Guarantee VS Door Deal, whichever one is higher in favor of the artist. This is in situations where the band want a guaranteed amount of money to cover expenses and secure their tour budget, but in the event that the ticket sales are high the band will make more money.

### Split Point Deal

Which is a deal where by the artist has a guarantee, but also has the opportunity to make more money based on venue expenses and ticket revenue. Lets say you are signing a Performance Contract for an **80% Split Point** Deal after $500. The first thing to do is to calculate the dollar amount of the Split Point itself.

**The Split Point** =(*Box Office Revenue*)-(*Expenses*)-(*Tax*)-(*Artist Guarantee*)

You sell 100 tickets at $10 each, so the Box Office revenue is $1,000. The venue expenses, including audio engineers, security for your show, marketing expenses and overhead, total $250. The sales tax on tickets sold is 5%, or $50.

**The Split Point** = (*$1,000*)-(*$250*)-(*$50*)-(*$500*) = **$200**

When you reach the Split Point, that is called ‚Äú***Going into Points***‚Äù. Any overage past the Split point is then split per the previously negotiated Percentage. (which in this scenario, is 80%). You will be walking home with $160 from going into points plus your guarantee of $500 for a total of $660.

>The Versus Deal differs from the Split Point because in a **Split Point**, the Artist gets their guarantee AND some, while in a **Versus Deal** the Artist gets their guarantee OR some.

# How to Interact with the Promoter

### How often do you follow up with a Promoter if they don‚Äôt respond to your email?

*‚ÄúFor a cold lead, You can start reaching out to promoters as early as 6 months in advance of the show or hold requested. When sending cold emails, you should email a ton of venues all at once, like throwing darts at a dartboard. Most will be misses, but some will stick. And you can lock those in to build your route. Focus on regional batches. For Example, ask for holds during a 2 week period in Northern California/West Coast, and then the following 2 week period in Southern California/SouthWest.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúAfter about a month of tricking emails and correspondence, you can send you follow ups to all the cold leads who did not respond (which will be most of them). Make sure before you follow up that you check the event calendars for these venues. Do your due diligence to make sure that date is publicly available on their end. Once you are in the 2-month time frame, you can begin sending follow ups once a week until a route is locked in.‚Äù*

*‚Äú90% of the time, promoters are appreciative that the booking agent is staying on top of the show with weekly follow up. They may have read you initial email, made a mental note of the show, but forgotten to write back. You never know if your emails are going into a spam folder or how busy the promoters are. Most likely, you will receive curt emails like ‚Äúnot available‚Äù, ‚Äúno‚Äù, or ‚ÄúOK‚Äù, from promoters when trying to book a show. These people are very busy! But or the most part, a promoter will not be annoyed with follow ups about a show, as long as the show is publicly available, because that‚Äôs how the business works.‚Äù (Erwin Schemankewitz)*

## Keep your emails short and sweet

When emailing a promoter or venue, keep your emails short and sweet: Include pertinent information only!

[Hypothetical email looking to secure a Hold from a Promoter](https://i.imgur.com/ZjQHf6X.png)

They don‚Äôt need your bio, or a persuasive argument about why your band should receive priority on the show. Do not send any attachments on the email. Instead, format the body of the email with hyperlinks, such as to the bands website, social media, or a spreadsheet of their history in that market. Lastly, do not inflate you numbers! If you can only draw 50 people, that‚Äôs fine. There is room for you in the market to grow and promoters understand this. The deal structure will reflect those numbers, of course. But at the end of the day, the market decides. And if you tell the promoter you can bring 200 people and sell 40 tickets‚Ä¶ you won‚Äôt be invited back.

## Make a ‚ÄúMarket History Report‚Äù:

A ***Market History Report*** is an organized account of your touring history. Usually in the form of an excel spreadsheet or Google Sheet, a Market History Report should be searchable, organized, and regularly updated. The Best MHR will include:

* Show Date & Venue
* How much money you made
* Region, City
* Performance Fee
* Ticket Sales (#)
* Ticket Price ($)
* Scale of 1‚Äì5 on Quality of the Performance/Crowd (*subjective measurement*)

# How to Classify Markets:

In the Live Concert & Touring industry, markets (*cities*) are classified into three sizes: **Tertiary Markets** (*smallest*), **Secondary Markets** (*middle*), and **Primary Markets** (*largest*).

### Tertiary Markets

**Tertiary Market**: the smallest of the three classification of market size. This is a small city or town, somewhere with a population of less than 50,000 people. Doing well in these markets can be attributed to a limited nightlife and music scene. Or its the hometown of one of your band members and you pack the club out with your local friends. These markets typically do not have theaters, but small clubs or large bars. This market sells 50‚Äì1,000 tickets.

[Tybee Island, GA](https://i.imgur.com/AM8wYPu.png)

### Secondary Markets

**Secondary Markets**: The middle classification of market size. The majority of your touring will be spent in Secondary markets. These are small‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälarge cities with populations between 50k and 1 million. These markets have large theaters, developed arts communities, and an active nightlife. This market sells 200‚Äì5,000 tickets.

[Asheville, NC](https://i.imgur.com/l9c4I3c.png)

### Primary Markets

**Primary Markets**: These are really big cities: LA, Atlanta, Dallas, New York City, Toronto, Seattle, Nashville, Boston, Chicago, etc. Success in Primary markets is crucial to a booking agent because these markets are the most scalable. An artist can grow from 500 tickets sold to 50,000 in the same city. Routing a tour through Primary markets is easier and more lucrative for all parties involved.

[Atlanta, GA](https://i.imgur.com/DdyoCgP.png)

# The Deal is The Deal

You can assume that the venue is lowballing on their first offer, but generally there is very little room for negotiation on a Performance Contract. Especially in the areas of hospitality, the venue will offer what they are capable of up front. In the case of a larger food buyout or a paid-for hotel room, this isn‚Äôt something that can be leveraged against the promoter. If the venue has a runner, they will be upfront about it. If the venue has a loft for the band to sleep in, they will be upfront about it.

For negotiating the Artist‚Äôs Performance Fee, the market will decide. If you can sell 50 tickets vs 500, your payment will accurately reflect that. Some venues have successful weekday show series, like a Monday Funk Night that will generate more revenue than normal. However you should consider Sunday through Tuesday to be off days or bad deals. For example, a door deal at a bar in an unfamiliar market might not even be worth the trip out there, unless it routes you to a better market later in the week.




### Pay Attention to the Radius Clause

A[ *Radius Clause*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_clause) is a time frame or geographic restriction that prevents an artist from playing a competing show. Standard radius Clause is 60 Days and 60 Miles and can be found in the performance Contract. It gives the promoter a form of territorial exclusivity over the performance. If get caught breaking a radius clause, that is legal justification for the promoter to remove you from the show. Radius Clauses are almost always found in contracts for soft-ticket events, so an event where you are not the main attraction such as a music festival. Make sure you or your manager is reviewing every performance contracts just in case. Failing to uphold your Radius Clause looks really bad on the artist and the management.

### Consider the Underplay

It is easy to get caught up in the numbers game. And that‚Äôs because the most important component of social marketing is non-quantifiable. You can‚Äôt turn it into numbers. You can‚Äôt measure it, you can only measure the results. That thing, is HYPE. An[ *Underplay*](https://www.denverpost.com/2009/01/01/underplay-bookings-guarantee-full-houses/), is a show that is guaranteed to sell-out because the venue capacity is so much smaller than the expected attendance.

While this strategy might not work for you financially, a close-to-home and stripped down version of your set can be great for building a community.

### Pay Attention to Local Support

Paying attention to which local band is going to support your headlining bill is a hidden gem that many club level bands completely ignore. You can essentially co-opt the entire fanbase of a well picked local support act. This is not only a good strategy for long-term market growth, but is also a healthy tit-for-tat in the concert industry. You provide an event just out of reach of the local act to do by themselves, and in turn they offer you the chance to impress their audience.

If you are a small local band looking to be booked onto a larger show this way, you need to starve your home market and build as much hype as you can. I know that this sounds paradoxical, but it‚Äôs simple Supply and Demand. The goal here is to create as much demand as possible (*creating and distributing high quality content, gathering press*) while limiting the opportunity for people to pay to see you play at a venue. Doing this correctly will give you leverage over other bands that the Promoter may be considering.

If you are a Touring band, do some research into the scene as to what bands have hype in that city and reach out to them directly. Be prepared to sacrifice some of the financial security of the show in exchange for them pulling a large crowd. You can offer to split a % of the back end or even a % of the door. If you have a band in mind, reach out to the Promoter about what kind of deal can be offered.

### Leverage Social Media accounts as Digital Credibility

Social Media is the first place a promoter will look first to discover information about the band. You should have amazing socials, with high-quality content that lets the promoter know you are a responsible business, and that you have the capacity to promote the show well and make the Promoter some money.

A small, organic and engaged audience is more valuable than a large, non-engaging audience. The questions that the Promoter needs answered is: Will this band sell tickets? Show promotion is a risk, and aside from seeing you in concert, social media is the medium for measuring an Artist‚Äôs success. If a promoter can see that you have a devoted, organic, and engaged audience, you‚Äôre more likely to be placed on the bill.

Certainly on your Social Media you should have high quality examples of your music and of your live show. How you choose to build you digital community is up to you, but know that every promoter considering adding you to a show, whether its a soft-ticket festival or a headlining spot at a club, will investigate your social media as digital credibility to your market history.

# Know the Lingo

***Hard Ticket***: Is an event where the main attraction is a specific artist. People in attendance are only paying to see a specific artist(s). Example: Headlining or Support artist in a club or theater.

***Soft Ticket:*** An event where the event itself is the main attraction and ticket seller and the artists are apart of the event. Example: City Music and Arts Festival

***The Advance***: Confirming in advance the details surrounding your show with the venue or promoter. Most of the details about the show will be confirmed when the performance contract is signed, but it is courteous to reach out the venue a few days before your show to confirm any last minute details, such as back line availability, parking, and hospitality.

***Back line***\*\*:\*\* Musical gear, such as drum hardware, guitar amps, or a bass guitar cabinet, that is provided by the venue for the band. This is common on Festival sets, when there are multiple bands performing with tight changeovers. This is also common when touring internationally, as it is both expensive and very difficult to bring gear with you into other countries.

***Buy Out***\*\*:\*\* Is when, in lieu of providing a meal to the band, the venue will just pay a flat sum to the band to purchase food.

***Buy On:*** Is when a smaller artist pays to be the supporting act for a larger artist

***Hall Fee***\*\*:\*\* The hall fee is a percentage (*20‚Äì25%*) of the total merch sales taken by the venue in exchange for allowing merchandise to be sold. Generally, only larger rooms will ask for a Hall Fee, like Theaters or Outdoor Festivals. A Hall Fee may sometimes be negotiated out of a contract in exchange for a smaller Guarantee.

***Load In/Soundcheck:*** Load In is the time where the venue will be open and your band is expected to arrive. Soundcheck means the stage is built, all technical processes are ready, and all band and crew members are on site. The reason I bring this up is to pay special attention to your routing. If your band has a 6 hour drive to the venue, it‚Äôs unlikely you will make a 3pm soundcheck.

>As an audio engineer, I don‚Äôt mind line-checking a group 30 minutes before doors open. But I do mind showing up to the venue to work and waiting around for 3 hours for the band to show up because they have poor communication skills.

***Performance Contract***\*\*:\*\* When the show is confirmed, the band will be asked by the promoter to send and sign a performance contract that finalizes details about the show, such as details regarding settlement, set times, load in and load out times, the radius clause, and more.

***Rider***: This is a document attached to the performance contract that address the artist‚Äôs hospitality or technical needs. This document ‚Äú*rides*‚Äù on top of the performance contract.

***Comp***: abbreviation of complimentary. Such as: ‚Äú*Comped tickets*‚Äù or a ‚Äú*meal comp*‚Äù.

***The Nut***: Expenses on the Venue side. This includes things like Production, Security, Taxes, Cleaning Staff, Marketing Expenses, Insurance, and other overhead costs.

***Deadwood***: Unsold Tickets

***Papering the House***: Is when a venue gives away tickets, or let‚Äôs people into the venue for free to put more bodies in the room.

## Don‚Äôt take anything personally

Whatever happens, and only as long as you have done your due diligence, problems with routing and getting shows probably has nothing to do with you. The Music Business is a whirlwind of chaos, email threads, lost communication, and alcoholism. Sometimes things that seemed perfect on paper don‚Äôt work out. Sometimes responsible people make mistakes. Sometimes the show gets double booked, or the headliner gets stuck in traffic. Bands are a business, and business should never be taken personally. You just have to roll with the punches.

995,Friend/Bandmate is too confident in our music. How to get him to chill out?,31,musicians,43,"I love the music my band makes, I think it's good music. I think people who like this kind of music would dig it. But my friend (the guitarist of course lol) is way too optimistic.

Some quotes to show what I mean:
- ""If a record label hears our music we're gonna get a huge deal""

- ""Our music will change rap/pop listeners into rock listeners""

- ""I've never heard another small band as good as us""

- ""I showed my friends our songs and they all say it's so good""

- ""Our songs are always stuck in my head so they would make good top40 hits""

14,Think less about what fans can do for you:,12,musicians,2,"Balancing self-expression with serving your audience is crucial for success as an artist. Knowing your target demographic allows you to create content that resonates with them, rather than shouting into the void. 

Your entertainment style (music, fashion, videos, themes, social media, etc) isn‚Äôt for everyone. So who‚Äôs the average fan it‚Äôs for specifically?

Make a list of traits you think they have. For example, a band that sounds like Mumford & Sons will have a disproportionate amount of fans that drive Toyota and Subaru, enjoy hiking, listen to NPR, recycle, etc.

Marketing is a mixture of psychology and sociology. It involves building a brand your niche of followers identify with and nurturing relationships with them through thoughtful content. It's a symbiotic relationship where both artists and fans benefit.

Think less about what fans can do for you and more about what you can do for them.

Hope this helps!

17,Take breaks. 99 steps forward and 98 steps backwards is still 1 step forward. I‚Äôm so close to finishing a song and it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to admit when something is good enough to stop. To reiterate to anyone else feeling the same way: take breaks. ,4,musicians,1,
18,Tell me about the first time you got on stage (want to hear from everyone but ESPECIALLY singers),41,musicians,67,"I started learning guitar around 10 years old, and here I am at 28 and I've still never played a show. I'm such a coward about it. I hate eyes on me in any setting. I can play well when I'm alone, but as soon as I have an audience I start screwing up when playing anything that's not simple. Even if I write something cool and tell my wife to come hear it I'll screw it up every single time once she is present, and then when she leaves I'll get it right again. I was in a few bands as a teen and luckily could play in front of the few friends we would occasionally bring to practices, but I was terrified to get on stage when the time came. I was gonna suck it up and deal with it of course because It would have been more embarrassing to tell my friends I was scared, but fortunately we never made it that far so I never had to.

I've recently been getting into singing more, and my buddy and I have been producing some songs with me doing vocals instead of guitar. I kind of dig it and I think I like the idea of singing. But there's even more expectation for a stage presence as a singer because now you're talking to the crowd and people are paying more attention to you, at least as a guitarist I could just hang off to the side and do my thing. We're not even a band, so there's no plan to play any shows anytime soon. But last night I went to a show, and idk it just seemed so easy.  All these casual people just got on stage, did their thing, had fun, and got offstage. I kept just feeling disappointed that I've let so much time go by and haven't just done it yet.

I'm hoping to hear some of your first show nerve stories and how it went / how you felt afterwards to hopefully help me realize I can do it. So let's hear them!"
23,Take care of your hands,19,musicians,15,"Wasn‚Äôt careful and fractured a finger, jammed/damaged my knuckle and have some ligament damage. As a guitarist, it‚Äôs devastating - haven‚Äôt been able to play my instrument properly in a week and will likely be another week or two before I can begin practicing and gigging. Take care of your hands y‚Äôall!

27,Growing Fans After Gigs,13,musicians,18,"Hi r/musicians,

Long time lurker of reddit and just discovered this subreddit. Wanted to ask for some advice, what sorts of things do you do to thrn a casual attendee/walk-in from a gig to a full-time fan? My band has been gigging at local spots for the last 6 months or so, album released on spotify etc, but want to continue to grow a local fan base and headline larger venues.

We typically do one or to promotional lines in the set between songs, but that‚Äôs really about it. Shout the instagram, give out some free stickers, say thank you. Wondering what sorts of things you all do to get that new listener engaged and bring them into your sphere. Looking forward to advice and improving our ability to grow our fanbase!"
33,Changing up gig habits,30,musicians,83,"My band has a standing gig at a craft beer joint everyone month, so needless to say, we imbibe some tasty beverages courtesy of the house. I‚Äôve gotten into a rut and I can tell it affects my playing later in the night as well as my mental state the rest of the weekend. Any tips for drinks to replace the IPAs and such? It‚Äôs always a fun time, just tired of the same old routine of play, drink, recover for two days."
37,I was a musician,38,musicians,34,"I was a musician. Now, idk. Doesn't feel right to claim it. I hardly look at my guitar. I hardly sing. It makes me sad to think about, it's like a part of me died but I've just changed directions a lot. 

I care about art and music. Music very definitely plays a major role in my daily life. I just don't know how to pick it up again. I'm disgusted with my lack of skill and the fact that I never did get that good. 

There's really no point to this post, I guess I just wanted to vent. 

I hope Y'all the best whether it's fun around a camp fire or goals to fill the garden stadium. "

It seems like being in a band is 95 percent BS like all of the band members disagreeing about the set list, trying to get everyone‚Äôs schedules lined up, band members who aren‚Äôt committed, and a constant clashing of egos. I don‚Äôt really sing, so that takes most solo gigs off the table. I would like to keep making music, but after this last band I feel like I need a break from dealing with band mates, venues etc. I used to look forward to making music and now it seems like a chore. Should I just focus on other things for now?  I like the idea of being part of a group, but my life is more peaceful when I‚Äôm not. "
58,Your favorite portable (pocket-size) non-reed instrument for suggestions? ,15,musicians,65,"I played Clarinet for years and I travel a lot, plus I'm a circus performer. I've been interested in picking up a woodwind (but open to brass/string) that's very portable (like fits in a large coat pocket type portable), doesn't require much maintenance, but also has some range on it. I was thinking of recorder, but I haven't seen any videos really selling me on it and it has a pretty strong connotation of being a beginner/school kid instrument, which I know is more so just being cheap and easy to give to a kid. That led me to the tin whistle, but it seems very limited, which is a negative effect most small/portable instruments suffer from. 

I would like to avoid instruments with reeds that aren't built in, like the xaphoon, for example, or need electricity/batteries. I would prefer a whistle type mouthpiece, but I'm potentially open to something you traditionally see with flutes if it grabs my attention. I'd also like it to have pretty good range on the type of music it can play, which I know will also vary based on the music itself (trad/folk music from various parts of the world ex: Irish, Japanese, Native Am, etc). 

I even looked at non-woodwind like the pocket trumpet, but it seems to be unpopular due to poor construction, or the pocket violin, but would take a loooot more practice (but I'm comparing that to why I never learned my violin as an adult, because of the time investment just to get to mediocre). I do already have a kalimba which I dabble with, but lacks the range in types of music it can sound like. 

I know that greatly limits my options, but curious if I'm missing something after looking over recorder, tin whistle, pan pipes, quena, native flute, venova, ocarina, harmonica, jaw harp, and more. I'm probably leaning towards tin whistle, because the cost, ease of use, and portability greatly outweigh the con of its limits, but curious if there was something that might fit what I'm looking for better. 

I appreciate the suggestions and looking forward to researching what's mentioned. Thanks! "

66,People asking to sing on stage when playing live,163,musicians,377,"I‚Äôm singer songwriter that performs solo. When I play shows it‚Äôs just me singing and playing the acoustic guitar, doing my originals and covers out at local dive bars throughout the state I live in. 

Now I completely understand people coming up and politely making requests, it‚Äôs tough being put on the spot but I try to make it happen as long as it‚Äôs a song I‚Äôm familiar with. 

But what really makes me mad is the amount of people I have come up and ask if they can sing a song on stage. It‚Äôs even gotten to the point where they ask to play my guitar (f*** no you‚Äôre not playing my Martin). I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a solo performer or what, but I feel like this never happens when I‚Äôm out at a bar and I see full bands playing.

The day after our first post about it, the club emails us and says they‚Äôve been informed about allegations against my band mate, and will no longer be allowing our band to play. I was blindsided, I had no clue about any of this. My band mate informs me that a few years ago, while he was involved in another group, that he was having sex with a woman who had a boyfriend. The boyfriend found out one way or another, and my band mate claims that to save face, she accused him of assault. The rest of the group took her side, and he resigned his position. 

Now I‚Äôve known this dude half my life. I just can‚Äôt fathom him doing anything remotely related to sexual assault, but I also struggle with accepting that someone would lie about something so serious, although I know that‚Äôs happened. There‚Äôs no evidence in either direction other than the word of both parties, and I‚Äôm still vague on some things, including the exact nature of the allegations. But now I‚Äôm in the unenviable position of either believing my friend and appearing to be an apologist for abuse to at least some group of people, or terminating his role despite his possible innocence. Has anyone been through something similar, or just have any advice for me? Thanks

EDIT: just to add some details, there was never any police involvement, and he‚Äôs claiming they had multiple sexual encounters, and that she was living with the boyfriend at his parents house during all this. "
91,Would you back someone who isn't very good? ,137,musicians,174,"I used to gig with someone and it was getting rough. He wouldn't make setlists and take long pauses between songs deciding what to do. He'd spring new songs on us at the gig, expecting us to follow along. He wouldn't play in time or listen to the rhythm section. 

Even though I enjoyed playing out it was draining and I also worried it would reflect poorly on me. I'm not perfect but I recognize when I mess up and practice. He didn't seem to do this and actually would get annoyed we didn't know the songs he had just come up with. So I stopped playing. 

He's reached out about playing again. Apparently he's had trouble finding backing musicians, so I feel bad. But I am wary of being in more bad shows. 

How would you proceed? Just say no? Try to be clear about expectations (like a setlist)? "

143,House shows with grumpy neighbor,23,musicians,37,"My bandmates and I are moving into a new house in May and wanted to use the basement to practice and potentially host house shows.  We wanted these shows to be focused on people having a good time listening to the music and not getting wasted (like some other house venues in town promote) so we'd plan on trying to draw a pretty tame and respectful crowd.  Recently we learned that our next-door neighbor is a grumpy old lady who has harassed bands who have lived in the house in the past.  These bands used the basement for a practice space and she would yell at them to be quiet, spewing falsities such as lying about the way the noise ordinance works in town.  She would also threaten to call the band's parents (ok??), the landlord (they don't care), and the cops (the only group I am worried about).  I think we should be able to practice without much trouble but we are unsure about the house show thing now.  According to the band who lives at the house now this neighbor has never called the police on them but they have also never hosted shows there.  Generally, the cops in town are not assholes about house shows so I'm not sure there would be much of an issue but I'd still like to avoid it.  One other thing I should add is that this neighbor technically does trespass into the backyard to bang on the windows of the basement when bands have been practicing in the past."

167,How to Let Go of Negative Experiences that Made You Lose Faith in Playing? ,21,musicians,55,"Before I stopped, I was a lifelong player of music. Bass and Bari Sax. Got eaten alive by college and the job market after, tried several bands afterwards that would go from 6 months to a year of nothing but accolades (top 40 classic rock/ RnB hits, 60s/70s Ska, proto punk like Johnny Thunders, etc).

Rock/punk bands were longer, bitchier projects; always a conflict over whatever could be identified as out of order. A few bands went over years that never returned on the time invested. 

I severely lost interest in music when I had a friend reveal that he was essentially poisoning the well of friends that we both shared in music. This after we more or less got scammed bait and switch style by a singer's ambitions to get laid with someone who more or less had her own musical ambitions that hijacked ours. Long story. 

I've always thought of myself as original, but when most people all the way from family to (what you know as) friends convey all your ideas are garbage, it's better to just assimilate to someone else's agenda, enjoy being the tool, you'll go places, it rips all connection I have with music out. 

I love music when I think it's appreciated. But my experience has been you're only valued so long as you fuel someone else's show. 

How do you put aside all the ""shit"" that you deal with trying to relate to people? I look back on a lot of what I dealt with, and despite getting a DAW and audio interface I just feel disconnected.

190,Survey: how do you study songs and artists to influence your own music?,2,musicians,1,"Hi! I've been creating music for about 20 years. I've recently lost my non-music related full-time job, and am taking this time to find a new project where I can combine my passion (music) with what I most liked about my career (data). 

My musical process is mainly driven by my own personal tastes, intuitions, and creativity (what makes me me). Simultaneously, I am inevitably influenced by the songs and artists that I like the most or that are most successful in my chosen genres. For the latter, I often self-study by active listening and analysis or by consuming videos or data to understand what makes that music great, impactful, and palatable for the audience in these genres. I like understanding, musically, *why* we like it so much. 

I would like to build a project that allows musicians to easily access and understand data related to successful music and its attributes, such as tempos, key signatures, chord progressions, song lengths, themes, and instruments used. The data would be compiled and accessible to understand what current successful songs have in common on a broader scale, to help us, as musicians, be more successful by 1) adapting to trends or 2) differentiating ourselves from trends to help us stand out. 

The purpose of this project is not to encourage artists to ""sell out,"" but rather to leverage data to help us become successful. Just like any other industry, it's important to understand the market we're part of in order to achieve sustainable success, and that's my ultimate aim: helping educate and inform the creative process with data to help us live out our dreams.

I've put together a quick, anonymous survey and would be appreciative of anyone that would like to collaborate. Thank you so much in advance!

191,Does production seem robotic to anyone?,12,musicians,38,"I've listened to a lot of amateur producers, and mid-level producers.  And while many of them are great, 95% of solo projects have a similar vibe.  Elevator music is the absolutely the wrong concept, but it's more robotic, it's not as organic, and it's hitting things exactly when it needs to be hit and it attacks you.

When you have musicians, and even producers, that take the time to give each sound it's own journey into the open space of that music, it's just distinctly different.  As opposed to someone just layering things over and over with ""that sounds great"" as the leading idea.

I'm probably in my head about this, though.  I know there's tons of nuance.

228,"One member of the band is so bad that he's dragging everyone down, but he's also a good friend. How Can I handle this ?",84,musicians,158,"Hi there,

A bit of context: I joined a blues rock band over a year ago as a singer. It's a group of four friends from the same village, all in their forties, and I'm the newcomer, the youngest, the girl... 
I got back into music after a long break and I really clicked with the atmosphere. We don't have any ambitions other than having fun. At first, I was finding my groove, no problem, but the more we progress, the more I feel limited.

Well, they're not great musicians, they know it, but I don't hold it against them; playing for fun is also good, and I have another more serious project on the side. I won't dwell on all the problems, because ultimately, they'd probably all be solved if we had a decent drummer.

But our drummer is a nightmare. Can't keep the beat, gets lost in the songs, and is very (very) limited technically. It's awful. I've put in a lot of effort to help him improve, but everything I try fails.

I know that without him, everything would be better, and in fact, I took advantage of a day when he wasn't there to suggest to the others to play along with a drum machine. They played better than ever and they noticed it. 
But here's the thing: as bad as our drummer may be, he's also a good guy. And especially, he's the mega buddy of the two guitarists. So, I don't come out as a winner if there's ever an open ""conflict"" except that...

...They've also all noticed that I push them to do better. Let's say that my outsider perspective encourages them to challenge themselves more than they did before, just among friends... And I can see that they feel inspired to try more complicated things. They would definitely be capable of it with another drummer, once again.

So, the question is:
How do I convince them to say goodbye to the drummer?
Or from your experiences, is it a lost cause, and should I leave the ship or keep my mouth shut? (Which would be ironic for a singer...).

234,"Solo artists: what's better--your own name, a pseudonym, or a ""band"" name? ",4,musicians,11,"So, I have a pretty common name, and I release music under my own name. It doesn't conform to a specific genre--pop/folk/rock/classical/jazz/soundtrack is the only way to describe it.

To differentiate myself from the zillion other people with my name, I include a middle name. Trouble is, it feels a little stodgy and square, maybe even pretentious, and that's not the vibe I'm going for. It might cause people to not want to listen to it. (It's not that I'm trying to become famous. That ship has sailed, but I'd like to have a little more exposure--who doesn't? I don't gig, so I'm pretty much totally obscure)

Another option--come up with a ""band name"" that is unique and cool (easier said than done). Pros--maybe more people would want to hear my shit. Cons--what about everything I've already released under my own name? It's on all the streaming platforms. Will it be forgotten? Could the potential two names somehow be linked? And could it also be considered pretentious to use a fake name? 

Compare classical music (pretty much 100% using actual names), soundtracks (99% actual names), country (‚âà95% actual names), jazz (‚âà 90% actual names) to pop/rock (maybe 35/65 in favor of stage names).

My stuff takes elements of all the above, so I don't have that to use as a guideline. Anyone have any strong feelings either way?

Have switched all cables around, does not resolve buzzing. When the BP60D is unplugged running on its internal battery I'm not hearing a buzz. Buzz exists when volume is on. No buzz when volume is off. 

See pic for set up. A buddy suggested it was a grounding issue and to ditch the power strips. But I don't want to run on battery when I don't have to. I cannot plug in directly to power.

Any ideas on a fix? It's mostly an annoyance. The buzz is not heard on the other 3 speakers that are used for ambiance enhancement, but it is very audible on my monitor. Thank you!"

272,Any other singers that hate their singing voice?,65,musicians,79,"Soo I'm 33 years old. Ive loved performing and  been writing music all my life but I've always been too anxious to actually sing (even though that was my dream to sing in a rock band).

Ive loved all types of different singing styles over the years, but I want to rock so bad. I thought I had a voice for it but something didn't feel right.

I finally started vocal lessons a few years ago and Ive been practicing and listening to myself sing all types of different styles. But the one that feels the most comfortable for me is folk music üò≠.

I know all I have to do is write folk rock but I'm just pissed off that my voice is meant for that and I'm not made for harsh strong sounds that rock needs. I have a strong powerful sound but it only works properly with the ups and downs folk has and I'm unhappy about it.

Do any other singers have this? Or any one have any advice?

Edit: OK the response from the community here has been incredibly supportive and positive with a lot of good advice. I'm sorry I can't respond to all of you (I don't have the time to type out everything I would want to sayüòÖ). Let me just sum it up and say thank you to everyone! I wasn't expecting anyone to get back to me let alone all of you and so quickly. I'll talk all of your advice and focus on what I can do.

303,‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotten complaints about the volume.‚Äù,321,musicians,154,"   I did a mall gig playing piano last week and the mall staff kept telling me I was too loud, in stark contrast to every single customer walking by and store employees giving me thumbs up and encouraging comments. One customer was even present when the staff member told me to quiet down and actually told them off for me lol. I wouldn‚Äôt have been so direct myself. This is after I had closed the lid completely, used the soft pedal the whole time, and switched to soft easy listening music.
    
Seriously where to these people get off? It‚Äôs not the first time this has happened, it happens at restaurants too.
   
My dearest children, you set up a GRAND piano in an echo chamber, hired me after I sent in video clips and described clearly the kind of music that I play (Chopin, Liszt etc.), then complain about the noise? What do you want from me? Why waste money on a grand? Why waste money on my skills? Why have live music at all?
   
I know this is nothing new, but getting back into music after 10 years has made me much more aware of these things lately. The things we put up with for music.

Update: 
The mall manager who hired me responded. What she said: 
‚ÄúWhat? Who said it was too loud? I loved listening to your playing from my office! Some of the store managers want you to come back every day haha! I heard you drew quite the crowd too, we‚Äôd love to have you back. You won‚Äôt have to worry about volume, like I said I don‚Äôt know why you were told that. Let me know if you can!‚Äù 
I might actually go back now."
321,Musicians with bad stage fright. Advice for playing the first time,67,musicians,154,"Hi I‚Äôm 13 and I started playing guitar about a year ago and piano a couple months ago. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm at an amateur level on guitar, I‚Äôm not sure. Anyway the place I‚Äôm taking lessons has like ‚Äúrecitals‚Äùand my grandparents which who are paying for my lessons as well as the employee that schedules lessons wants me to sign up and I said I would talk to my instructor about learning a song and doing the next one. But the thought of that terrifies me. I‚Äôm very anxious and especially socially anxious when the attention is on me or specifically around people my age to the point where I do online school. I know playing in front of people is a must need skill and I want to do it, I think about it often. I did theater when I was younger and though I had a lot of stage fright I still always had other people on stage with me so it‚Äôs much less scary. Not to mention my fears gotten worse so I guess I‚Äôm just asking if anyone else with bad stage fright or anxiety has any advice for playing the first time? I‚Äôve always had this mindset of not showing people stuff until you know you‚Äôre really good and though I‚Äôm progressing, I‚Äôm not great. Also does anyone know what it might be like? I‚Äôm taking lessons at gc. Thanks.

  
Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented didn‚Äôt expect this much. A lot of very useful tips that have definitely made it seem much less scary. I have another question just in case someone sees this, i live in Wa and the music scene in the part I live In is pretty bad. I mean I don‚Äôt know much but I know there‚Äôs really not much going on here. So I was just wondering how anyone else with similar experience approached finding places to play/ open mics. Just a question for the future:)"
329,I'm sad,75,musicians,164,"You guys probably have heard of Suno ai or Udio. These are top ai companies hell bent on replicating our creativity and offering it to the world like it was a fast food item! It is obvious theft.

I hope there's something we can all do to band together against this injustice. I think ai companies should be forced to pay artists that have had their music ripped for the sake of making an ai song. These ai models are just code and the code leaves an unbiased digital trail. Royalties can certainly be traced this way. The corporations need to be held accountable and the artists, who are unknowingly being used to help produce these songs, need to be compensated. 

Also let's cool it down on making fun of JoJo Siwa. It's even hurting my feelings at this point.

346,Creative disputes,4,musicians,22,"Hello! I need some advice from people in bands. Recently, my band has been going through some turmoil because I feel like my band members aren‚Äôt taking up the responsibilities of being in a band, but expecting to have their vision of what they want come true.

 I am the lead singer, I write all the lyrics, and most of the guitar, and bass parts. I also do all the art for merch and fliers and social media stuff, as well as our booking. Now you might be thinking I‚Äôm a control freak, and while I do have my own vision of what the band should be, I CONSTANTLY ask other members to take on some of these responsibilities or to give me meaningful feedback. I always either send mock ups of the art, conversations with organizers, or WIPs of the songs that I‚Äôm writing and ask what they think. And they either straight up don‚Äôt give me a response or give me vague critiques like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it‚Äù or my favorite ‚Äúmy opinion is nebulous‚Äù. I‚Äôve asked them to help me write riffs, make their own merch designs, or to help out with logistics ect. But then in return, they get upset with me when the output is not what they imagined or I make creative decisions on my own. And the few times that they have stepped up to do something they expect that what they make will absolutely not be criticized in any way. 

I told them that essentially I can‚Äôt read their mind, and if they want more of a say, they can take up more responsibilities and use clearer communication. But that was brushed under the rug, do I quit? Or do I figure something out."
354,"Any musicians who work blue collar/trade jobs, what has your experience been like?",9,musicians,30,"I have recently been contemplating going to trade school, as my current college is being defunded. Music is my life outside of work/school: I play guitar and sing for a metal band (genre is like Death meets Dillinger Escape Plan, so pretty technical and progressive). Most of the blue collar workers I know seem super happy and are very down-to-earth, so I think I would enjoy the social environment. I also love to work with my hands, which makes it seem like an ideal career path for someone like me.

However‚Ä¶

Though it sounds ridiculous, the only thing keeping me from pursuing a trade is the fear of losing hand functionality due to a workplace accident; I would be so depressed if I lost the ability to play music. I have heard so many horror stories from electricians, carpenters, etc.

I‚Äôd like to hear some honest opinions from anyone who has gone the trade route while also pursuing music. Are there certain trades that are safer than others for musicians? Any recommendations or advice is greatly appreciated!

361,Is mediocrity acceptable in music? ,69,musicians,348,"I can think of dozen of fields where you can be objectively mediocre at your job, i.e. lack some optional skills that would otherwise elevate your competence. And you would be just fine. 
But in music, I can‚Äôt help to think that mediocrity just fails to attract any attention, evoke emotion or anything else that a listener expects. As a result, there is no prospect in it for a person who does not at least attempt to constantly elevate their craft. Even at the Friday bar you expect live music to be at least good enough on the background

365,Making a career,18,musicians,31,"Here's a question I had. 

Out of those that made a career with music, are you happy where you are and with what you achieved? Did you end up making good money? 

I have dreams to make it big with a band when I hopefully join one, but I also gotta make sure I am clothed, sheltered, and can put food on the table every night. But itd be neat to be a gig person, going around playing for different bands, or teaching othets. What is everyone's experience with making music a career? "
380,Playing by ear but not understanding what I'm playing,10,musicians,30,"TLDR: I'm an amateur player but I can play by ear pretty well on guitar (my friend say I have relatively perfect pitch) but I never know what notes I'm playing or what key which makes me feel stagnant.  


So for context, I had basic musical training when I was a kid (reading notes, learning keys and scales) but that's pretty much the extent of my formal training. I started with piano and learned guitar and then went to boarding school, so I couldn't get the instruction I was receiving anymore. 

My mum noticed pretty early that if I heard a song, I could fairly match the basic melody on the piano if I heard it enough times. Since then and now in my young adulthood, I've become more of a guitar enthusiast, and over the years, I can say that most of the time now,  if a song is playing, I can pick up the melody (and sometimes harmonize) in a couple seconds while it's being played. The main issue is I don't know how. 

I have no idea what notes I'm playing most of the time unless I actually try and pay attention to my finger position (which is hard to do if you're trying to match something on the fly). I can't explain to people how it happens but it just feels like if I can hear the song in my head, I can try to guess/predict where the next note will be. I'm grateful for the ability to do this but I'm also deeply frustrated by it sometimes because I would like to know what I'm playing. I would love to be able to identify what key I'm in, and even go up a level by figuring out what chords to play for the song rather than just the basic melody. However, I feel stuck and unsure of how to proceed from here (I'm also not in the position to get lessons because I'm a broke college student :( . If you guys have any tips or thoughts regarding any of this, I would greatly appreciate it!"
408,Pouring our heart and soul into our art only to be consumed as entertainment ,5,musicians,25,"I know some people pursue music privately and don't care about whether anyone likes it. But I know I'm not like that. Sure I can keep things private for a while but eventually I need to come out of my hole to catch a breath of air and to get feedback from the world. But with that comes the ups and downs of praise and criticism, and personally I get really distracted by that. Its especially disheartening when people seemingly fail to see the value of what we hold dear, probably because to them it's just another post to consume, whereas to us it's a piece of our vulnerable self. But then putting things out there also is motivating in itself. Its been a difficult balance. How do you guys manage that??"

430,Ex husband has ruined me in the local musical community ,271,musicians,334,"Hoping for some actual help here and not angry or passive aggressive responses please. 

My ex left our family abruptly a little over a year ago. We are both musicians and in fact that is how we met originally. 

When he first left, since he totally disassociated he was free to play open mics and establish himself in the local community by playing every single night while I dealt with all the responsibilities of our home, daughter, pets, finances, not to mention the deep depression of having someone you love for 11 years walk out on your family. 

I played a few open mics here and there to get my creative juices flowing again. And I found a good community near my home which was a bit far from him. But then he started going there as well. Since he did so, and since I can't get out as frequently as he does because all the responsibilities were left on me, he ruined the few friendships I had established.

He is everywhere, knows everyone now. And I've begged him to please talk this out as I am completely alienated. He seems to be enjoying the control. I didn't cheat or anything- in fact he did. And he abandoned his step daughter of 11 years. But I have been the one dealing with the backlash. 

How do I get back out there knowing the music community is a tight arena and I don't want anyone caught up in this mess? Especially since he's completely taken over the local scene? I really need some help. We're all musicians here, without this outlet and opportunity to even make friends that are musicians I am so isolated. I need a way back in knowing he won't even remotely give an inch. "

436,How can I approach my band and tell them it‚Äôs good to play venues that aren‚Äôt houses or backyards ,51,musicians,58,"I‚Äôm (28, male, drummer) in a band that I love. I love our music and I like the guys that I‚Äôm playing with. We‚Äôve got music released this year, more on the way, and we‚Äôve been playing a lot this year. 

The other guys in my group are 21, 20, and 19. 
A lot of their friends are under 21. 
An issue with our shows is that they want their friends to come in and watch us, which happens when we do backyard shows, but it‚Äôs more difficult when it‚Äôs at a bar. 

We just played a show at a bar, and one of the guys said that he doesn‚Äôt want to play there anymore because his girlfriend (age 19) can‚Äôt be inside watching us. 

I understand where they‚Äôre coming from, but in my opinion, it‚Äôs important for us to play to people that aren‚Äôt just our friends and peer group, we should play to as many different audiences as possible, and venues and bars are some of the best places to do that. 

I‚Äôve expressed this to them before but, they still don‚Äôt like the fact that bars and venues have age restrictions. 

What can I do more to let them know that it‚Äôs important for us to grow by stepping out of our comfort zone and playing for ‚Äúgrown ups‚Äù and strangers? "

442,Who are the best truly solo artists?,6,musicians,11,"I think my problem as a solo singer songwriter is that I've been trying to interpret my 'full band rock song' style songs on stage as a solo singer songwriter. It just ends up sounding incomplete somehow when played live. 

So... I'm thinking like... when Richard Dawson or Jake Xerxes Fussell play live, it doesn't sound like it's missing anything. It sounds like it's *supposed* to be played solo - one guitar, one voice, even when - in the case of RD - it's climactic and loud and almost metallic sounding.

Even Elliott Smith, or Junior Brother, who has been recommended to be off the back of loving Richard Dawson's work, augments his live shows with other musicians.

I want to be influenced by music which is authentic, idiosyncratic, and sounds like it was supposed to be played by one person and a guitar. 

I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me some artists to draw influence from. No particular genre, but preferably not Jeff Buckley or that type of thing.

Who should I look up? Thanks folks! "

456,Getting paid...,14,musicians,43,"So I've always wondered how else this works around the world but I wanna talk about unsigned bands getting paid. Here in the UK, mostly when you start out, it's very rare to get paid for a show. Here there's a lot of door deals, where a venue give you a cut of the money from the people that came to the venue to see you specifically. Obviously no one knows who you are, and getting just a small handful of friends can be very difficult if it's a crappy day of the week and you don't play until 10pm.

I've always thought about it this way, a venue needs to make money, if you don't bring anyone then no money is going over the bar and the venue are losing money with staff and running costs. It's the music BUSINESS, so if you can't make any money for the venue, then why should they give you anything?

But let's have a healthy debate over this...how does it work in your part of the world?

This is my first dive into being a full time musician, with a local band that‚Äôs *just* starting to break out nationally.

Trying to find a house and move states definitely hampered my practice time the last 3 months‚Ä¶ but this band is my job - it‚Äôs my responsibility to have my shit together. It was a little easier in November/December because we were playing or practicing once or twice a week. Along with moving, we‚Äôve only had 2 gigs a month in feb/march/april, and I haven‚Äôt been practicing with the band leader at all. All the band practice has been on-boarding the new fiddler or working on studio prep for our first album.

If you got this far in the weeds - thanks for reading. I‚Äôm posting this from my ‚Äòanonymous‚Äô account so no - I won‚Äôt give further info on the band or our location."

513,we need a new platform. NOW!,29,musicians,20,"myspace would give you 100 listeners in a week without any promotion. Soundcloud 5 months ago did the same. But today, if you don't promote your own music, it won't get any listeners anywhere. 

Distribution platforms just want your money and won't promote you at all.

There's no platforms for new listeners to go after new music.

If you're an artist on spotify you don't even know the people that listen to you. You don't have a way to connect with your audience!

I'm not saying you don't need to promote your music. I'm just saying there's no platform that will at least make you be heard if you don't go around posting some links. And this is not  good!

I don't know about you guys, but all my friends only discover new music on spotify. Not sometimes on soundcloud, sometimes on youtube, ONLY on spotify.

There's no mail list, no liking or replying comments from fans, no way to make your audience feel like they are part of a group.

the song is produced with kontakt guitars, bass, and used keyscape pianos, i also mixed and recorded by me, a rare occurance as i like to use 'type beats' from YT producers I know do the style I'm decent in. But, anytime *I* produce a song, I always feel like its sh\*t, and could be heavier in, lets say bass or in the mixing. But with this one I think my vocals are mixed well but i could be very wrong...

I'm really open to feedback (good, constructive, bad or even upsetting) and would just love to know if anything in the snippet i've linked is too overbearing, loud and things along those lines.

555,Best way to get gigs as an acoustics live looping artist?,8,musicians,22,"I‚Äôve got 60 solid cover tunes, killer rig, pa, lighting, YouTube page, FB page. Now I just need gigs, and they seem really hard to come by. Maybe I‚Äôm going about it wrong? 

Some venues I drop off a card to the bar staff (booking person never seems to be available) and other venues I‚Äôve emailed (about 40 in 3 months) which I never get replies. I do have a couple gigs lined up from doing the things listed, but the ratio is pretty discouraging. 

Is it a bad idea to follow up the emails with maybe a FB message, or a call? I‚Äôd hate to pester managers or bar staff, but it seems like I‚Äôm spinning my wheels. 

Is it necessary to show face at the venues and just keep asking and just bide my time? Some gigs lead to more gigs kinda thing?

583,Would you perform a paid gig for YOUR repeat client with somebody whose music you like and objectively know is a good artist but haven't jammed with before?,10,musicians,33,"Update: Thank you everybody for your responses. After considering all your perspectives, getting an opinion from a good buddy who has worked with the artist numerous times in the past, and having a follow up convo with him not having time for a jam sesh but explaining his music mentality and methodology, and weighing the risks vs benefits, I have decided to give it a go with the artist I posted about. Mahalo!

I have a VIP client that I do all their expos for as a duo. My bandmate recently quit music so I've been building up an alternate roster. We do live looping, live jamming lounge instrumentals. The gig is to provide low level background music to greet expo attendees at the front door. I've brought on one new bandmate that I've busked with several times, so there's been a certain level of vibe and trust established. There are two days, my new bandmate is taking day 1 with me. I would ideally like to use day 2 for another musician to expand the bandmate roster for future gigs. If not, I'll bring in the new bandmate.

One much more established musician in my network has expressed interest in the gig. I've seen him perform many times, we know each other through these performances as I have worked many events with his talent buyer. However, we don't know each other on a personal level, have never hung out outside a show, or ever played music together. Show is in a couple weeks. I've asked to jam first to see how we vibe and he says he's too busy. I'm only considering him an option because I've seen him perform before several times, like his music and it would be fun to perform with him. I have expressed to him that this is my VIP repeat client and I do not want to deliver a less quality product than what they are used to. He says as long as he knows the keys it'll be fine. I get this, but I think there's a lot more to vibing in a performance duo than just knowing the keys.

I've only ever performed a paid gig with people I've jammed with before. Am I being too anal here? Do you guys have wisdom to share? I'm currently leaning towards a no.

Edit: My instrumentals, while not overly complicated IMO, are originals."

606,best instrument for 1 fully working hand?,6,musicians,18,I have cerebral palsy and so was wondering what instrument I could play with one fully working hand (right) and one partially working hand?

618,What's the best way to say to a  musician that they messed up and did not practice for the gig?,120,musicians,200,"Just want to know people's thoughts? I'm an a few bands and run my own aswell. This does not happen a lot but whenever I come across a player that came unprepared the normal thing I do is to ask someone else next time to take there place. 

I used to give these players some slack and hoping they play better next time but almost always they mess up. So now I'm a lot less patient, especially if the gigs I get are paid well. 

These actions have gotten me in a bit of bother. A great guitarist and good friend of mine was this kind of player who didn't practice. I passed the next gig off to another guitarist and he was really upset with me, saying that ""as a band leader, I would have appreciated a lot more direction from you and we would not have had this problem"". 

Btw, all my music has recordings, demos and charts written out. 

I find it really hard to confront people about there playing, that's why I have stuck to my normal method. But now I'm open to more solutions.

634,"To folks who play shows/gigs regularly, what should a complete newbie know about before getting started?",7,musicians,36,"I‚Äôm sure a lot of the common etiquette and things to know/prepare for seem obvious to those who have been in the game for a while. But to someone who‚Äôs a bedroom musician looking to start playing live, it may not be so evident.

What are the most important/essential/beneficial/(etc.) things to know when getting into the live scene?

And what do you wish you knew about before you began gigging? As in, what you would go back and tell yourself from the past with the knowledge you have now.

Would really appreciate any and all replies. Thanks! :)

[If it matters, my plan is to perform live as a solo artist (primarily focusing on original material) but with a fuller sound than just 1 instrument; I‚Äôll create fully instrumented tracks, remove the parts I can play live, then play along to what then functions as a backing track. It‚Äôs unideal - obviously I wish I could convey the full experience 100% live - but alas, I only have 4 limbs and 1 mouth, and am lacking the finances to constantly hire people to play my stuff.]"
653,I‚Äôve just played guitar for the last time at church,54,musicians,31,"Just wanted to express my feelings about playing for the very last time at the church I‚Äôve attended my whole life.

I‚Äôm a (27M) guitarist, started playing when I was 13 and have only ever played at church, and tonight was the last time I played with the band. 

I started way from the bottom and I‚Äôve been band leader for about 3-4 years now. It‚Äôs bitter sweet bc tonight I played with the musicians I started out with and felt great to give it one last go together.

It‚Äôs beautiful to look back on all this years that have passed and seeing how much I‚Äôve taught to others even without trying. 

I hope I find another band where I‚Äôm going and hopefully I‚Äôll appreciate them as much as I‚Äôve done with the bands I‚Äôve played with at my church. 

Not a question but a musician being a bit sentimental. 

If you have similar stories feel free to share how you felt when you left and how you coped. I guess it is a question right? üòÇüòÇ

Edit: The reason I‚Äôm leaving is because I‚Äôm moving to another country soon and inevitably had to step down. No other reason, forgot to say. "

Super open-ended question, but I'm asking cuz personally I'm in a situation where music has become a bigger part of my life (rediscovered guitar/music after 30, started in teens). I have no desire to become a professional at all, but I do wonder if I should invest more into it. I know no one can answer my question for me, so I'm just curious to hear about your experiences I guess!"

730,Friend got famous and I'm jealous? Advice?,205,musicians,314,"I'm not jealous - just frustrated :) It's frustrating to witness my friend's sudden rise to fame on TikTok. Overnight, he went from having 3K followers to a staggering 200K on Instagram and half a million on TikTok, with his Spotify garnering 10 million listeners and reaching the number 1 spot on global charts. 

I am genuinely pleased to see my friend experience this success because his songs are great. I am just frustrated and feeling hopeless because this success seemed entirely random; his song went viral without much effort or consistency on his part - he made the song, hasn't really been posting much TikToks and doesn't know much about marketing; just posted a TikTok (nothing special) and it popped off. While you may suggest it's an attestation that his success means others can do it too.. it's disheartening seeing other artists including this friend who have some other OUTSTANDING songs, market them so much, put so much effort into writing/production/marketing... and nothing happens. 

It feels like success in the music industry boils down to luck so much.... leaving us feeling demotivated and overlooked despite our efforts.

Anyone felt the same? Any advice?"

762,Help dealing with a patronizing band member,53,musicians,100,"I am currently in a band that has no real goals outside of playing at local bars.  It's totally fine.  I am a rhythm guitarist for the group, while my band member is the lead guitarist as well as the lead singer.  He's very difficult to work with.  He won't listen to my ideas, as well as the others.  He comes up with the setlists himself and doesn't ask for our input.  And above all else, he is very condescending whenever we provide an audio clip of us playing or practicing in person.  Always says things like ""oh, that's good bud.  A little slower than the original but not bad.""  I also asked if I could play a few piano songs on my keyboard, showed him a song.  The band loved it, and thought it was a great idea.  He shut it down because ""nobody cares about piano"".  Should I just leave the band if I'm not enjoying it?"

769,How do I find people to jam with?,41,musicians,49,"Feel like most people would say. Jamming with other musicians is how you get better. Ok, well I‚Äôve tried jamming with a bunch of people. And it hasn‚Äôt gone well at all. I thought I‚Äôd find a lot of cool like-minded people that would be willing to show me stuff. If anything what I‚Äôve experienced is the opposite. Everyone I‚Äôve jammed with seems to get off on critiquing my playing. Instead of offering tips, or knowledge. They just rip on my playing. Like I get it. I gotta lot of stuff to work on. But that‚Äôs why I want to jam with ppl. But a lot of these people act like I have to be a professional musician just to get my foot in the door. And they guard their knowledge like it‚Äôs the secret to the universe lol. I thought it was all about sharing passion and love for music? I just want to make music but it feels like meeting ppl to form a band or jam with is impossible. And if it‚Äôs something that I really am serious about. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôm going to have to do on my own. Should I keep trying or is it a lost cause?"
782,Thinking of playing instruments again but afraid I can't do it.,3,musicians,8,"So I have already played multiple instruments when growing up. I first played the piano until elementary school. Then I switched to orchestra and private lessons in middle school and beginning of highschool . Then I started playing guitar mid-highschool till the beginning of last year when I decided to stop cause I couldn't juggle both classes at the lessons. 

I am kinda having a crisis and I would like to refund myself and start enjoying doing stuff again instead of just consuming content, and I miss just playing music. 

However I just feel tired and just do other stuff that is menial and low effort. I feel like I can't find the energy to do anything meaningful (which is another issue by itself but related to my want to play again.)

I am also considering what I should play. I don't have a piano or keyboard anymore, my violin was a rental. I just have the guitar now. Idk if I should play a new instrument or just do one that I have played before.

So I guess I have a few questions. How do you keep yourself motivated to play an instrument? And how did you choose what instrument you wanted to play? "
787,What do you charge to play 2-3 hours solo?,11,musicians,31,"Background: I am an upright bassist/electric bassist/singer-songwriter/guitarist.

I have usually played with a band, sometimes fronting, sometimes as just the bassist, but never a solo show. 

I was told it was on a Saturday, from 12-4. I gave her (my colleague who first asked me, ""What do you charge?)"" samples of my singing and playing bass.

She seemed interested but I didn't have any recordings of me doing covers, just my originals.

I figure I would mostly be singing and playing funk/r&b guitar. I do have a loop pedal that might expand my sound, though I am still new to using it.

Anyway, wondering what is reasonable to charge if it's just me? I don't know yet how long I would be expected to play, but I imagine it's at least two sets."
794,"Anyone else hate playing live? Those of you that enjoy it, why? ",57,musicians,221,"I guess I‚Äôm trying to figure out why other musicians enjoy playing their music live. What are the honest reasons that performing gives you fulfillment. I‚Äôm newer to recording music and have found a ton of catharsis and enjoyment in recording and producing my own music, as well as collaborations (via file sharing). I‚Äôm in a group with 3 men and none of them seem to mind playing out and they even enjoy it. I have extreme social anxiety, and I am a working wife and mom of 2 young kids and while we don‚Äôt play out often, it‚Äôs such a drag for me to cut my work schedule, find a sitter, lugging gear around, be out late, etc‚Ä¶on top of hating performing and only being comfortable in my studio alone with my laptop. I‚Äôm about to throw in the towel and tell them I don‚Äôt want to do any more live shows (we‚Äôve only done 3 and have a 4th coming up next week). But I don‚Äôt want to be a party crasher and basically kill our live presence since I‚Äôm a bit of the main feature in our band by contributing vocals and multiple instruments and providing the structure of our set. Please tell me some positives you get from it. Bonus is you‚Äôre a mom too:)"
798,What is up with haters on social media?,182,musicians,408,"The more I put my music out on social media, the more I run into this. Some folks will go out of their way to comment on my videos to say that the performance or the music sucks. I try to pay attention to all the other positive and uplifting comments I get, which are the majority, but these hateful ones tend to affect me regardless. 

I just want to understand what kind of person thinks like that. If I‚Äôm on social media and see an artist I don‚Äôt like, I don‚Äôt immediately get the urge to comment on their video letting them know I hate their music. I just scroll past it. I never wanna bring down someone who‚Äôs making themselves vulnerable and creating things for others. I don‚Äôt understand what goes through these people‚Äôs minds to make them wanna do that. I know big artists get hate all the time, but how must you‚Äôve been feeling inside to wanna comment that kind of stuff on a small artist‚Äôs feed? Like truly, what irks you to spend a minute of your day bringing someone down? "
801,I feel like it will never be good enough ,113,musicians,113,"After studying music for many years and graduating my music bachelor, I find myself wishing I‚Äôd done something else. 

I see my peers go viral, get playlisted, get radio play and playing gigs every week. I constantly stalk their numbers and see how mine are barely existent.

I truly believe my art and music is good enough, but I lack the willpower and nerve to put myself out there enough. I have tried my best to network but due to not being a conventionally attractive girl in the industry I struggle immensely to connect on a authentic level as they are superficial. 

This is no excuse but I am very alone in the world as I only have my brother and friends (my family isn‚Äôt in my life). I have never had a stable place to call home and I long for a peace and love I lack right now feeling like a failure next to my amazing peers. I don‚Äôt know if I should keep going or accept that I don‚Äôt want to give more of myself as it‚Äôs making me unhappy as of now.

EDIT:
Thank you for all the lovely replies. This morning I started missing the fun of writing songs and remembered why I even started doing music to begin with. All the different opinions and stories you have commented reminded me that being born with a creative drive is something beautiful, and regardless the outcome it‚Äôs a talent we should celebrate wether it‚Äôs alone in the rehearsal room or in front of a big crowd. I finally sat down and made a new playlist (it‚Äôs been 1 year since my last) and suddently I feel a little more alive again. I had forgotten how amazing it feels to discover new music‚Ä¶

In two weeks I have my final exam concert, a 40 min set with all my original work. I worked so hard and made a team of my band, strings, sax, dancers and a choir. I‚Äôll cherish the performance and be proud of doing what I always longed for.ü•π"
803,Aspiring Musician - How to get out there,4,musicians,14,"I am 17 years old and an aspiring musician. I have been playing guitar and singing for years, but only in the past few months have been seriously considering going into music as a job. I lean towards writing acoustic music - music that I can play live with a guitar, rather than using software to create digital music.

Really, I just don't know where to start. I live in a relatively big city, so there can be many potential options. I don't know if I should start performing (or where), or if there are other ways I can start to build the foundations for a future career in the music industry.

Any tips?"
808,Am I being unreasonable?,29,musicians,93,"So basically I have a wedding gig booked in late August and I‚Äôm playing for my cousins son who is getting married. I put together a band and asked one of the band members if he could give me a list of 20-30 songs that he knows and I also asked if he would be willing to learn any extra tunes (if requested by the bride and groom). 

He told me that I was ‚Äúputting too much work into it‚Äù and only gave me a list of 15 tunes. He also said he wasn‚Äôt willing to learn any extra tunes for ‚Äúonly one show.‚Äù

I was kind of shocked by his response, because I‚Äôve played many shows where I‚Äôve been asked to learn new songs, and my list of songs that I know is at least 50+ songs, so I feel like 20-30 songs really wasn‚Äôt that big of an ask.

But I want to know what you guys think, is it unreasonable to expect a band member to provide a decent length list of songs and be willing to learn at least a few new songs for a gig?"
812,How long do you start writing for a new project after putting out an album?,10,musicians,29,"I just put out my first album a couple days ago. Did the whole thing myself and was a long, tiring process but really happy with the turn out in every way. 

This took me about 8 months to complete and I still feel like writing and will continue to write but I am kind of shocked I‚Äôm not really depleted? I was thinking I‚Äôd need time away or to recharge a bit from writing, recording, demoing but I carry on a have a decent amount of new material already. 

Do you think there should be time taken away from these things to recharge? If you have put out a few projects and have a routine, what is that routine/ turn around to the next project/ album. Do you find yourself not as inspired if you start on another project right away after coming off the last one?

819,Rant about local promoter rivalry,7,musicians,9,"I'm in a small city with lots of pubs but only one dedicated live music venue. 

There's one local promoter who puts on free shows (with several acts on the bill) every week at a bar, plus he does a few 'weekenders' during the year, with lots of bands/duos/soloists performing across a couple of days. I would say it's like a hobby/obsession for him that he doesn't seek to profit from.

Lots of musicians like him and appreciate his contribution to keeping the local scene alive. However, Recently I've started to feel pissed off that he holds such a monopoly over local music, to the extent that it's very hard to get a paid gig - because why would people pay when there's free live music every week? 

I saw him ranting on social media about our city's one dedicated live venue where bands play ticketed shows, like he resents the fact that musicians want to get paid - and I am keen to distance myself from this. I believe he thinks we're friends and - although I am grateful for the musical opportunities - he has overshared stuff with me before that I wasn't comfortable with.

In the past I have turned down a slot on another local promoter's radio show because it's someone he has a rivalry with and I wanted to stay on the free promoter's good side. Now I'm returning to local live performance and I want to make it clear that I am a professional and not interested in this guys petty personal beefs if it disadvantages my exposure. 

Do you think this ""big fish, small pond"" mentality is a common thing with local music promoters? How do I stay neutral without seeming aloof?"

847,Stage Presence for Folk Musicians,8,musicians,20,"Hello

I‚Äôm a solo folk/singer-songwriter artist, and I‚Äôm curious if anyone has any tips on how artists like this can have stage presence so there‚Äôs no dead air between songs and to seem like you‚Äôre excited and enthused to be there (which I notice a lot of live acts seem the opposite when they play live).

I understand how rock musicians or rappers or more pop artists can have stage presence because their genres kind of foster and allow for gestures or spoken word to get audiences excited. For example, ‚ÄúMake some noise!‚Äù But I feel like that wouldn‚Äôt work in a folk artist‚Äôs situation.

I have a 30-minute set that I want to start playing over the summer, and I need advice. If you‚Äôre curious, some of my inspirations right now are Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Alex G, Phoebe Bridgers, with some country and bluegrass influences.

Also, I‚Äôm pretty new to posting on Reddit, so any advice on etiquette is helpful as well!

848,What‚Äôs your worst gig ever?,342,musicians,393,"I had recently started dating this girl, and she was interested in hearing my music. I invited her to an open mic on Valentine‚Äôs Day, 2018, where I would play one of my older songs and a new one that I had just written‚Äîfor her.

The person who played before me was a crowd favorite, so that amped up the pressure. But no problem‚Äîmy stuff is good too. I‚Äôll get up there and prove myself. I‚Äôll amaze this girl with the beauty of my music.

So I get up there‚Ä¶and crumble.

I couldn‚Äôt get accustomed to the mic. My pitch sounded bad‚Äîvery, very bad. I had some false starts. I kept forgetting chords and lyrics. The best parts of these songs flopped badly. The audience was clearly unmoved and disinterested. By the end of the ordeal, my face was beet red and I was sweating. Of course, the audience clapped politely. I‚Äôm sure they pitied me and felt my embarrassment‚Äîwhich kind of made it worse.

And my date? She had to leave shortly thereafter. And then she ghosted me.

It took me 5 years to get back on stage.

885,Undergrad Music Degree - Do I Finish?,10,musicians,23,"Hi there,

I am four semesters into a university music degree that would take me two more semesters to finish. 

I feel that I‚Äôve learned most of what I came to learn (theory and ear training, especially the fundamentals since I am mostly interested in pop music) and am not really enjoying myself anymore. 

I have little interest in analyzing any more classical pieces as I am not a classical musician and do not play piano nearly well enough to even perform any of the pieces we are analyzing in theory class at this point. I enjoy playing piano (not my main instrument) and plan to keep working on my piano playing, just feel that what I‚Äôm being asked to do theoretically is so far ahead of my playing ability that I see little value in it at this point. 

The ear training class has moved into the realm of atonal music and I am equally uninterested in that. I plan to keep working on my ear regardless, however, as I realize how important it is for what I want to do.  

As far as music history, I feel that I‚Äòd rather read books about it than take classes where I need to write papers and analyze old pieces which I am not really interested in.  

I currently make most of my income from performing music/gigging and none of the music I play (mostly pop/rock) has much to do with what we do in school, where it‚Äôs just classical and jazz. I‚Äòm primarily a drummer, by the way. 

I also record/produce music and hope to grow that into a bigger stream of income over the next few years. I do not feel that the music program I am in directly helps me do that either. Theory and ear training are obviously super important for that but I feel that it‚Äôs mostly the fundamentals that are crucial, as most popular music tends to be rather simple in terms of harmony, etc. 

What do you guys think‚Ä¶should I stick it out for two more semesters after this one or do I call it quits after this semester? 

How important is getting the degree/piece of paper?

Oh by the way, I already have a Bachelor‚Äòs degree so this would be a second one, albeit one in music, which I suppose could be a requirement for getting a teaching job in music. I don‚Äôt necessarily see myself teaching unless I need the money, however. 

Would really appreciate some input. "

913,How many of you are affected by tinnitus and how did it change your life as a musician?,12,musicians,16,"Hey guys,



I want to talk with you about a ""unpleasant"", but necessary topic, namely hearing protection and tinnitus.



TLDR: What is your experience with tinnitus? Did it stop you from doing music? Do you think its an unreasonable risk joining a metal band with chronic tinnitus with good, custom earplugs?

I\`m one of the lucky ones, who got chronic tinnitus from a metal concert in 2020. Yeah, I went to a good amount of shows/clubs in my life before that, wore a lot of headphones. Still, I was aware of the risks and tried to keep the volume reasonable and even started using some cheap musician ear plugs in the year before that.

Turns out that wasn't enough. It was one of the loudest shows I¬¥ve ever been to and next day, tinnius was insanely loud. Of cause, it didn't stay that loud, but also never completly went away. Also, it seems like I have slight hearing loss on my right side. A slight dip at the higher frequencies, but nothing that affects my life right now.

The impact on my mental health has been mixed....Luckily, most of the time, if I stay busy and there is background noise, I dont notice it at all or not that much. But every few weeks, there come a few days, where I completly fixate on it and start to become depresses, anxious and worried. Affects my ability to sleep and concentrate....what if it will get worse? Stuff like that.



At first I was very afraid of going to concerts, but got some custom molded earplugs from a professional store with the maximum filter.

https://preview.redd.it/4j9fn5yggarc1.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa6a37995356f0fe7e7a9d74511e5ea06797a784

I¬¥ve been hesitant at first cause I was very afraid of making the tinnitus worse, but since 2020 I¬¥ve been to like 2 concerts and a few times clubbing. Luckily, these plugs offered enough protection and afterwards I didnt have the feeling my tinnitus got worse.



Now, the reason why I am actually texting this. I started a metal band with some friends (I play guitar) and we already wrote a good amount of songs. But I kind of start to get worried, that I will permanently fuck up my ears even more and may and up at a point, where my tinnitus becomes unbearable.

Normally you could argue like ""okay, the band plays around 100-105dB. The earplugs reduce the noise exposure by 20-30 dB to around 70-90 dB. The time for safe listening of 90 dB, which would be the most pessemistic scenario, would be 4 hours. So probaly I¬¥d be fine if we play one gig per week.

But since my ears already took some permanent damage and hearing damage is cumulative, I am afraid my hearing might be more prone for further damage compared to normal people.

I¬¥m in a tough spot right now, since I feel like I have to make a decision between following my dream of playing in a metal band and risking potentially life ruining tinnitus, or giving up on it, in order to avoid this risk.

I¬¥ll definetly talk with an ENT and audiologist about it, but I assume some of you may had such kind of thoughts or experiences with the topic, that might help be guide my decision.



If you read on r/tinnitus....some people say they still go to shows etc, because they feel safe when using earplugs. But others made their tinnitus permenantly worse and advice against any kind of super loud environment. It¬¥s really depressing to read some of these storys.

So, I¬¥d be thankfull for any insight you could share on the topic.

Thanks in advance and all the best to you.

928,How to get into the scene as a band/solo artist?,4,musicians,5,"So for the last year I've been playing at jams and open mic nights in which i met a lot of people. There's two places I'm pretty sure I'm gonna play on from now (once a month each) but that's it. Also, me and some friends are starting a band (of mostly cover songs) and would like to start playing once a month. We already have a show prepared for Mid May (its a pretty casual, not in our name, event).
Do you think going to these two places will help me get contacts (I already know some artists and frineds who know places and can play with us/open for them when we get originals) and promote the group and myself as a musician or should i do something else too? 

Just some more facts: We prepared like 10 songs but on June we'll be playing 5, and then we'll start booking bars and places we could do a gig on our name (we dont have a band name yet lol)

Thanks!"

Near impossible to find any booking emails and when you call, more often than not, they are closed or the employee doesn‚Äôt know anything. I even called Live Nation directly and they can‚Äôt help but give generic email addresses. How in the world does any booking agent get a hold of these places much less an artist doing their own booking? I‚Äôm guessing the answer is there are inside baseball gatekeepers?

955,What should I do? Cancelling a gig with a replacement act lined up.,10,musicians,5,"So I (lead/ vocals) woke up two days before a smaller show at a local indie venue having completely lost my voice and tonsils so big I can't swallow. Two of my other band members also caught the same thing (we're a 4 piece band). I emailed the venue letting them know that we won't be able to go on, but that we're going to find another act in-genre that can take our spot. The next day, we found an act that was able to cover and emailed the venue, however, they haven't responded to us at all and we're still on the bill.

As I said, it's a smaller show on a Thursday night at 10:00, we were only expecting to bring around 10-15 people max. We've performed there before, everything went well, and we've maintained a good correspondence with the booker there.

I understand how much of an inconvenience this can be for the venue, which I why I got a replacement. I'm worried they won't book us again because of this. Did I do anything wrong and is there anything else I should do?

I'll remember a piece of paper, and then I'll set it on my piano when I get home, so I'll see it and remember to work on it when I have time. I still use my phone when I just don't have other options, but when possible, I'll use pen and paper.

I'm such a coward about it. I hate eyes on me in any setting. I can play well when I'm alone, but as soon as I have an audience I start screwing up when playing anything that's not simple. Even if I write something cool and tell my wife to come hear it I'll screw it up every single time once she is present, and then when she leaves I'll get it right again. I was in a few bands as a teen and luckily could play in front of the few friends we would occasionally bring to practices, but I was terrified to get on stage when the time came. I was gonna suck it up and deal with it of course because It would have been more embarrassing to tell my friends I was scared, but fortunately we never made it that far so I never had to.

I've recently been getting into singing more, and my buddy and I have been producing some songs with me doing vocals instead of guitar. I kind of dig it and I think I like the idea of singing. But there's even more expectation for a stage presence as a singer because now you're talking to the crowd and people are paying more attention to you, at least as a guitarist I could just hang off to the side and do my thing. We're not even a band, so there's no plan to play any shows anytime soon. But last night I went to a show, and idk it just seemed so easy.  All these casual people just got on stage, did their thing, had fun, and got offstage. I kept just feeling disappointed that I've let so much time go by and haven't just done it yet.

22,Think less about what fans can do for you:,21,musicians,15,"Balancing self-expression with serving your audience is crucial for success as an artist. Knowing your target demographic allows you to create content that resonates with them, rather than shouting into the void. 

Your entertainment style (music, fashion, videos, themes, social media, etc) isn‚Äôt for everyone. So who‚Äôs the average fan it‚Äôs for specifically?

Make a list of traits you think they have. For example, a band that sounds like Mumford & Sons will have a disproportionate amount of fans that drive Toyota and Subaru, enjoy hiking, listen to NPR, recycle, etc.

Marketing is a mixture of psychology and sociology. It involves building a brand your niche of followers identify with and nurturing relationships with them through thoughtful content. It's a symbiotic relationship where both artists and fans benefit.

Think less about what fans can do for you and more about what you can do for them.

Hope this helps!

We've been seeing a lot more of these posts and while they tend to be heavily upvoted, they also end up just being a picture of some DJ hunched over a setup with a bunch of back-patting in the comments that clutters up the sub.  Any posts of this nature will be deleted and the user will be directed to the weekly Sticky thread.

**The following topics are against sub rules and will be deleted:**

* Self-promotion posts including mixes, tunes, events, companies, competitions, etc.  The one exception we may allow are open deck nights that members of /r/DJs can attend.
* For-sale posts
* Posts discussing music piracy (in the sense of people asking how where or how to pirate music, if you want to have an actual discussion on piracy and how it pertains to the industry, by all means).  Support the people who make your hobby/career possible. 
* Obvious spam for youtube channels/gig logs/blogs/advertisements from members who have no participation in the sub. If people are regular posters on this sub and have a video/service/etc they wish to share, we will allow it initially, although regular spam of it will not be tolerated.
* Posts asking ‚Äúwhat should I play for this gig?‚Äù  This is a sub for experienced DJs, if you need to ask the internet what to play for a gig, you probably shouldn't have taken the gig.  General music discussion is absolutely fine.
* Spotify playlist posts

PLEASE REPORT posts and comments that violate the above rules or just suck. Thank you!"

4,First time using Algoriddim‚Äôs DJay Pro at a gig. I‚Äôm impressed.,74,DJs,59,"So I forgot my laptop at home for one of my residencies tonight. I could have gone home to grab it, but decided to give dj pro a try cause I had all the required adaptors, and had a decent collection of music still on my iPhone 12 Pro Max. I was djing off a Rane 72 and a single Rane Twelve and it was pretty flawless.


Plus there‚Äôs tidal support, which btw, I haven‚Äôt updated to the dj plan yet and it still worked - with stems and everything.

Low key restaurant gig so no real pressure but I did play for 4.5 hour. I haven‚Äôt used the program since like 2020

And holy shit did this program perform! 

I‚Äôm a serato dj through and through - and have been using the software since 2007 and I figured it out pretty quickly despite not using it in 4 years.

There a couple key features that I miss from Serato, and a few performance/design/mapping issues that bugged me, but i was really impressed by the overall experience.

I definitely enjoyed it more than playing o cdjs and even the denon gear.

I‚Äôve been hoping a dvs standalone solution that I thought would be in the form of a mixer with usb support, but I think djay pro is going to be the equivalent of usbs and cdjs for turntable/dvs djs.

Bring a phone, cables, headphones, and adapter if needed and you‚Äôre golden‚Ä¶"
5,The zoom H4 essential is a great device for recording your mixes,2,DJs,1,"I just wanted to come on here and share my experience because I've seen a lot of posts on here asking how to record mixes and use a recorder but having issues with the recordings clipping. 

I have a xone 96 which has a record out option via rca so I initially started with the zoom h1 essentials. Turns out the 3.5mm mic line in isn't built to handle the level of audio you get from a mixer unless you use an attenuator, which I did end up getting one but I had to babysit the levels on the mixer and keep them at around 0db otherwise it would still clip or get fairly close so I ended up returning it and getting the zoom h4 essential.

This thing has been so great. It has 1/4 line input which is built to handle audio from the mixer. I just plug it from the record out on my mixer directly to the h4e with an rca to dual 1/4 input, hit record and play my set as normal. Don't have to worry about setting levels on the device and can push the gain to the upper levels on the mixer without the recording clipping.

This thing is so convenient, no more lugging my laptop around to record sets, just plug n play. Audio is great, I should have went with this one in the first place."

8,Which genre rectangles the hardest?,30,DJs,62,"Just downloaded 23's last year's top 100 beatport DnB for a bit of fun. Having a great time mixing, but fuck me a quarter of the tracks are rectangles.

On that point, which genre is the biggest victim of the loudness wars?"
9,Is it off or is it just me? ,6,DJs,43,"So I‚Äôve been playing out a couple years not but have been about he scene a bit longer with generally just being a fan. One of the things you get to learn obviously is how people get themselves on the bill. And we‚Äôre talking here just your good local venues not big warehouse project nights or touring events.

Everyone gets in different ways. Very common to see people running events who put the same three mates on everytime, I get it. Another is maybe the venue owner puts their friends on every weekend, not many else get a look in. I get that. And then the rest of us are left to just put ourselves out there in hopes or  through becoming known slowly you get an opportunity to showcase your stuff at event once in a while. 

One I don‚Äôt understand is how sometimes there‚Äôs like that one guy who‚Äôs on every single event poster. Like every single one. I know loads of good DJs who aren‚Äôt getting this much play time in the local scene. Like are they just impeccably good at networking like what‚Äôs going on that everyone wants them on their thing? My brain isn‚Äôt computing what‚Äôs happening there? Or are they just good? I still feel a bit naive at times about how some things can work so not sure if theres something else to it that I‚Äôm not grasping or it‚Äôs just simply good DJing. 

Any one seen people get gigs for ridiculous reasons? I‚Äôm intrigued to know if there‚Äôs things I‚Äôm naive too "
10,Indoor speakers for a large room,0,DJs,11,"I'm looking for some advice on speakers to buy for my new set up.  I'm moving and I need something fairly loud to carry through a open plan kitchen/living room (around 39 square meters).  

I currently have a pair of KRK Rokit 5s for my bedroom but I would prefer something louder to accommodate for this larger space.

I've been looking into a Hi-fi set up and have been recommended a pair of Focal Vestia N1 with a Roksan Attessa Amplifier from a local store.  Or I was thinking another set of studio monitors but with a sub.

I will only be using them inside and I dont have a budget, open to suggestions"

12,Sound ,1,DJs,7,"Hi guys, I‚Äôve been through a few sets of monitors now over the years, KRK, Adam‚Äôs, Pioneer and now my latest Presonus Eris E8. 
Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, the E8‚Äôs are super crystal clear and honest which is perfect for Production but for DJ‚Äôing I always feel like all these monitors there just something missing, it doesn‚Äôt have that sort of rich immersive sound lim looking for. 

So I took the E8‚Äôs and connected them to my iMac and they will be used for production only.

So I went to a mates get together the other weekend and he had a older Hi-Fi Yamaha Surround sound hooked up to his DJ setup and I was like ‚ÄúYehhh this is what I‚Äôve been looking for‚Äù 

So my question is, I‚Äôve decided to go down the Hifi route, I‚Äôve seen these Sony Muteki type systems on Marketplace going for cheap but is there a setting on these amps to bypass the DSP so I can avoid any latency and lag? Or does someone know straight off the bat which one these Sony amps models/year/make that has direct through sound to avoid the latency/lag problem? 

May thanks"

So basically im doing a b2b at a new club, we both have two usb (no issues there) but we both want our laptops so we can stream tracks (since it's a new club and we have no idea what kind of crowd it is).

If the second laptop(rekordbox) is connected via DJ prolink is soundcloud streaming feasible or it's only on the downloaded tracks on the laptop?

18,PSA to clean out your playlists/collection (also hit me with your organization tips!),12,DJs,5,"This is obviously basic info, but I've been doing some housekeeping in Rekordbox and it's so rewarding! I'd love to get some insights and tips on how you keep things organized!

I play (very) open format and have been building my Rekordbox collection since I started in 2017. In the early stages I had the approach that it's better to have too much music for my 4hr set, and still I kept running out of songs to fit the vibe. So the collection kept building.

Some of my playlists have been big umbrella lists like ""Everything Hiphop"" or ""Everything 80s"" playlists. These last few years though I've been avoiding browsing those 1000 song lists while playing because they're just overwhelming and fruitless. So instead I stick to my newer, more specific playlists, e.g. ""Lo-fi House"" or ""Latin Disco"".

I realized there were an astonishing number of tracks I've never even played since 2017, which can be either reasonable or unfortunate. So I've started going through all the songs with 0 plays (then 1, 2 etc.) in my playlists and removing a whole lot of meh songs from the collection which were really just added in fear of running out of music. Some get to stay but in some other playlist, some get updated with new tags etc.

It feels so inspiring knowing that there are a lot less filler tracks in there and that the songs are in the playlist they belong! It's a never-ending work of course, but it's so worth it.

What are your tips for housekeeping?"

20,Study: Shifts in song lyrics in the last 4 decades,90,DJs,46,"My fellow music nerds, listen up:

This recent study analyzed a sample of 12000 songs spanning 40 years. The findings confirmed an ongoing trend of lyrics becoming simpler and more repetitive.

What's new and somehow not surprising: They also found shifts in the lyrical content. Mood wise lyrics became less happy, more sinister. And the use of self relating words (I, me, myself, ...) has risen, hinting at a more self focussing attitude in society.

Feel free to discuss. Or to nod slowly, murmuring ""I *knew* it"" because that's what reading science is really about."

22,"DJ‚Äôs who chose to obscure your identity, how/why did you do it, how did it go for you, and would you recommend it?",34,DJs,83,"Been making music for a while but want to finally release and perform live. Being around the scene, I‚Äôve noticed an uncomfortable number of ‚Äòdj‚Äôs‚Äô that give 0 fucks about the craft and only care about the lifestyle and making sure their socials make them look as cool as possible. 

I know it‚Äôs a tale as old as time and will always be a part of the industry/culture, but, for those of us that just love music and the craft and don‚Äôt need substances to find joy in sharing music you love with others, how did you differentiate yourself? 

To me, hiding my identity makes it more believable that I‚Äôm in it for the music and I don‚Äôt need to worry about always maintaining appearances/looking cool for instagram. Also I feel like so much of the discourse around music revolves around identity politics these days which to me (queer POC) still feels backwards. Music is one of the most powerful tools of unity we have as a species - it‚Äôs a truly universal language! Yet it feels like we often use it as a means of exclusion and ego/status. 

It‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôve always admired most about daft punk (I know their faces are out there but to most people who were unfamiliar with their faces but loved their music, daft punk could have been anyone) and other similar artists, although in recent times, it‚Äôs turned into a bit of a gimmick. What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts on this?

35,Ways to deal with needle skips / train wrecks when mixing vinyl in front of a crowd?,20,DJs,83,"Hi,

I want to start mixing vinyl at raves in the near future, after always doing it digitally. I've been mixing vinyl at home for a few years, but that's always in a more controlled setting with a stable table etc. I was wondering, what are some ways of dealing with needle skips, or just absolute train wrecks of a transition when playing in front of 100+ people? Two recent cases which I picked up at an all vinyl rave;

* The needle got stuck in a loop and skipped during a track. After around 3 iterations the DJ accelerated the record quickly right when the skip would happen and 'dragged' the record out of the loop. 
* DJ was working on a transition but everytime he was about to blend the new track in, the original track skipped, causing the tracks to no longer play in sync. He then immediately cut away the new track, beatmatched it and then tried again. Original track kept skipping. Above happened 3-4 times. Eventually he just pressed the stop button of the original track, let the track come to a full brake and just started the new record from the beginning. Despite the 'fuck up' the crowd was cheering a lot!
* Can't find a link on youtube so excuse the facebook link, but [this](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=299175728054417) needle skip fix by Fjaak is really cool. They just hit the turntable at the right time causing the needle to hop over the skipping point.

39,Am I the only DJ that hates working with screens on DJ controllers?,25,DJs,62,"Hi,

Every time I post questions about using Rekordbox or Virtual DJ in combination with Pioneer or Denon DJ controllers that have a screen i get the same answer:

""You shouldn't use a laptop. Use the screen on the controller.""

But I absolutely hate using that screen. My personal reason is that with my dyslexia a laptop is already hard enough to read and type. Reading and typing on a controller is absolutely exhausting for me. It's just one wall of words. Also, i mistype a lot and in an laptop it's so much easier to correct spelling mistakes. I would spend more time finding a song than actually on reading the crowd 

Plus I don't think the screens on controllers don't have the technological features a laptop has

40,I've been asked to DJ where there is no power source,30,DJs,92,"Hey everyone!

I've hit a bit of a snag with an upcoming event I'm involved in.

I've been asked to DJ for a local running event right here in our hometown. The twist? It's set along a trail that winds through the forest, off the beaten path. The event organizer has requested that I set up amidst the trees and provide a lively soundtrack to keep the runners motivated as they pass by‚Äîthink cheering, name-calling through the mic, the whole nine yards.

However, there's a challenge: there's no power source I can connect to. I have a Soundboks speaker and DDJ FLX4 that are easily carried to the spot I'm supposed to be in (can't get there by car).

Now, here's where I could use some advice: Is there a way for me to link up the controller with the speaker without a power outlet? Through the battery? Perhaps via a phone or iPad to the controller? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

42,On the nature of djing nowadays,74,DJs,87,"We mostly focus on the technical/skill/talent/competence aspect of djing. I‚Äôve been thinking more about the other side of djing, the social status/ clout chasing element. I feel like I just don‚Äôt understand it. No one likes to talk about it, but it really does feel like a popularity contest when we really get down to it. Some djs are more artistically motivated than others. But it‚Äôs impossible to ignore the forces at work. There are so many young kids just looking for attention and social status and to party with famous hot people. Obviously there are little pockets in each scene where people try to filter out that energy and enjoy a more communal experience that values authenticity. When we get more into the commercial side of the scene, obviously streaming numbers and ticket sales are what make the difference. But what about the less commercial side of djing? Is it more based on who you know? Or how long you‚Äôve been around? How do you get your foot in the door when you‚Äôre just a normal dude without a huge following or critical acclaim? Do local venues just see how many followers you have on IG and decide like that?"
43,Reloop Tape 2 Transfer...Recorded but with NO Audio???,0,DJs,6,"Hi y'all,

Has this happened to anyone with the Reloop Tape 2???

I recorded a set on my DJM900 Nexus with the Reloop tape 2. The levels were fine (according to the Signal light, and the Record light was flashing normally), and I'm sure I set it up correctly. I've used it many times.

However, this time I went to transfer my 3hr set from the device to the computer and when i uploaded it into Audacity, I see there is NO sound--no waveform.

But it still recorded the 3 hours because the two files are around 2GB and around 250MB. 

I double checked the input gain on the Reloop, and it was at an appropriate level, and the Signal/Peak light was green whenever i looked at it throughout the set.

Is it possible that the audio is SOMEWHERE inside the Reloop's mini SD and i just need to...find it??? Or is it lost and I just need to accept it?

(I think i'm done with my Reloop Tape two and ready for a Tascam...but I'd really love to have the recording of my set if it's possible!)."

So i have potential chance of investing this year to better gear.
I‚Äôm leaning more towards turntable setup, with vinyls and also digital vinyls (with laptop).
So the question is, i have probably around 2k‚Ç¨ (2.1k$) to invest into new gear. 
Should i buy Technics, which probably will run me 1k per piece and opt for more less fancy mixer, break little bit of my back financially, but then be happy with my workhorse, which will probably last me for the next lifetime.

OR

Opt out with Audio Technicas or Pioneer PLX-500/1000, which will be cheaper, and also buy a fancier mixer with leftover money?

47,The physical sensation of uncompressed music played from big speakers,0,DJs,61,"For the people who have access to the right speakers / subs and the proper space to try out, I would like to introduce an experiment to settle what I heard about the difference between uncompressed music vs mp3s.

Here is the argument:  When the uncompressed version of the track is played with the big speakers, some of the inaudible frequencies that are cut for the mp3 may be felt *physically* *different* in the uncompressed versions when played with proper speakers.

According to this idea, with the uncompressed music, the massaging /thumping sensation of bass and other physical aspects of the overall music is enhanced. So with the mp3s part of this *physical sensation* may be lost. This means that you hear the same sounds with mp3, but *might* *feel* less of it throughout the rest of your body.

So for the people who are willing to do this, it is of utmost importance to pretend that your ears do not exist. Try to feel the music only with the rest of your body, do the bass, the highs, the mids of the track feel somewhat *physically* different when you perceive their vibrations in wav or aiff vs mp3 formats?

Is anyone here able to test it out?"

49,Pioneer PLX-CRSS12 audio quality,0,DJs,6,"I'm browsing them and standard PLX-1000 too

Why they claim a better audio quality in PLX-CRSS12?

PLX-1000:   W&F <= 0,1%   \*   S/N = 70dB

51,what tempo do you cruise at when trying to build a vibe?,1,DJs,48,"i‚Äôll preface this question by saying it‚Äôs obviously very dependent on rhythm and musical style, but if you had to generalise, what tempo do you cruise at when trying to build a vibe?


please also mention if you generally play in particular styles/genres and if you mean in a bar/club context 



i‚Äôve been playing regularly at this local bar which has a nice energetic atmosphere and a chunky sub (an RCF system - a bit ‚Äòpointy‚Äô to my ears, but gets things done:) generally i like to start around crunchy instrumental hip hop tempos and then into 105-115 funky crunchy electronic beats (breaks, house, techno, electro and disco)‚Ä¶. and then i like to move around, jumping between 120-135 (doing sections of them). and i enjoy dipping into some 140, both straighter and more dubstep leaning (i mean proper more mnml dubstep). and if the night calls for some 150bpm madness and some footwork/jungle, all the better!

anyway‚Ä¶. im wondering if im spending too much time in hip hop tempo‚Ä¶.? i‚Äôve noticed i could use more tunes around 110bpm

these sets are (unfortunately) being played on CDJ-350s (i have & love my 2000s and Technics at home). 350s are fucking difficult to ‚Äòmake a story‚Äô with. the displays suck, like playing on a calculator. but the gigs are fun once a vibe has been built:) i‚Äôll always improvise in these gigs, which keeps things interesting (for me, anyway!). tonight i blended Kraftwerk with some Norwegian abstract house (if i remember correctly). about 40 years of electronic music in 7 mins? üòé

just curious what others do to build a vibe üòé

52,Almost had a terrible gig today but somehow turned it around,31,DJs,21,"Some context:

I consider myself a beginner DJ because I only really started DJing back in September 2023. I use Virtual DJ with a DDJ200 mainly because I come from a lower class family and don't really have the money to get Serato or upgrade my equipment. I've played at school events, a few birthday parties and at some cafes/ lounges and people always say I'm good at DJing. My friend hired me for my biggest gig yet a few weeks ago, a yacht party which was earlier today.

So I reached there half an hour early to set up. One thing to note is that when I've needed to use my own equipment at venues where a controller isn't provided, because the DDJ 200 doesn't have audio output, I always carry a 3.5mm to dual 1/4 inch splitter with me that I connect through my laptop aux to a mixer. When I got to the yacht today and started setting up I realized that the yacht's sound system didn't use a mixer with the input I needed. The company who owned the yacht provided me a controller though, a DDJ1000SRT, which I quickly downloaded the drivers for and started trying to get used to. That was when I hit my biggest roadblock: because all the DJs who the yacht company employed used Serato, the mapping was all over the place for me. Deck A gave me no problems, but the knobs for Deck B weren't mapped for VDJ at all. 

By the time I realized this, the party was supposed to start in 15 minutes so I started freaking out. I tried restarting my laptop, redownloading the drivers and going through everything in the VDJ settings and I still couldn't fix the mapping. People started coming on to the yacht and the employees said I needed to start playing music at the point, so I gave up and loaded up my tracks. My first few transitions were really basic but in around 10 minutes I started to get the mapping. Although there were still a few features in the software that the mapping on the controller didn't allow me to use, I started using some new techniques for mixing that I've never used before and slowly started to adapt. Despite how awful the set started out it ended as possibly my best set yet. 

I guess I'm just trying to say that I learnt an extremely important lesson today despite my good set: ALWAYS CHECK WITH THE VENUE ABOUT WHAT THE SETUP IS LIKE. Most people in this subreddit most likely already do that, but for those who don't you definitely need to start."
53,Question about the Hercules T7.,4,DJs,4,"I currently have a Rane One, but it's starting to crap out on me, and I might have to start looking into another controller. I currently live in Korea so any DJ gear is 3 times what it is in the states so like a Rev 7 is like $3,000 so that's out of the question .

The question I want to ask is, is the Hercules T7 any good for anyone who owns one, and worth replacing the Rane over?"
54,AITA for telling my dj coworker to back off from hijacking my decks and criticizing my set at a gig?,118,DJs,80,"I finally got a residency at a bar I have been trying to play for months just a few weeks ago. I play Friday nights while a guy who works for the same dj company I do plays Saturdays. He is in his 50‚Äôs and has been djing for way longer than I have (I‚Äôm 23). Every time I have played at this bar I have packed the floor and had people chant for an encore so I am familiar with this crowd and know what they like and how to get them hyped. 

Anyway my coworker stopped in tonight to watch me and I let him hang out with me in the booth. I was kind of put off when he told me to move over while he mixed a few tracks without asking me permission if he could. After he went to grab a drink he started texting me that I went into a ‚Äúhood‚Äù rap set far too early in the night and that I should make more of an effort to blend my tracks better despite the fact that I was key and beatmatching and mixing in each song at least 8 bars before i made a full switch. 

Later, he came back up to the booth and hijacked my controller again and kept criticizing everything I was doing. The last straw for me was when I saw him load up a track I was hoping to save for later in the night. I told him not to play it because I wanted to save it and he went ahead and mixed it anyway. I then told him that while I appreciate his feedback and recognize that he has been doing this way longer than me, he was overwhelming me and that I wanted him to leave me alone. He told me to relax and have fun and that he never intended to piss me off, but that I needed to listen to him and learn from him. He could then see me become visibly upset and started apologizing and telling me I was doing a good job afterall. After we went b2b on a couple more songs, he finally left me alone and left the bar without saying goodbye, which is unlike him as he is usually very friendly. 

I look up to this guy a lot and worry that I came off as sensitive and unteachable, but like I said before I worked my ass for this residency and feel like he had no business ‚Äúschooling‚Äù me on the spot like that, especially when he will be playing that same venue the following day and has had his residency there for years while this is finally my time to shine. I still get nervous at the beginning of my sets but once I get into the flow I‚Äôm good for the night. His barging in like that threw me off and stopped me from getting out of my head. Once he left I felt better and had a great rest of the night, but I cant stop thinking about how much better it would have been had he not intruded like that. Thoughts?"

57,EV Speakers in the direct sunlight‚Ä¶ bad?,0,DJs,16,"Hey all,

I‚Äôm currently DJing an event and my PA speakers were in direct sunlight for about 2 hours playing at a loud volume in about 70 degree weather. 2 hours into the gig, they provided me with a tent and I moved them under cover.

I've searched through several of my favorite retail outlets for equipment but came up dry as to what they were.   And yes I realize there is far more to getting amazing sound out of a PA than just ""what speakers did they use""  but this is one piece of the puzzle that I'm missing.

Doto Designs have the best designs by far. All very elegant and sophisticated but they are pretty expensive and ship outside the USA which makes the shipping over $25. Id consider Doto if the shipping wasnt so much. Doto does have their logo on the skin but it looks nice and I dont mind it.

My friend had old KRK Rokits that I liked for the low end, but I've read that the newer G4/G5 have a flatter sound. I've read good things about Focal Alpha having a nice low end and sweet spot. Any DJs here using them? 

I would look at PA speakers or large bookshelves, but if I bought any I feel I'd just be taking a stab in the dark as I've no experience of listening to those types of speakers.

The device is the same as the low/mid/high EQs mixers have on channels, except this is for the Master output (which some mixers like the v10 have).

Besides the Master vs. Track ISO, and the big button it has to turn off the iso effect, are there any noteworthy differences between what this does and what a mixers EQs do? 

I'm trying to understand the value. The places I play at usually have DJM-750Mk2s and I play with an XDJ-RX3 at home.

One of the topics in this week's Ask Me Anything live stream for DJs was all about dissecting what went awry with Grimes at Coachella 2024. I kept it strictly factual, steering clear of any personal biases. Toward the end, I couldn't resist airing out my thoughts on the overuse of the term ""DJ/Producer"" - it's a rant worth catching!

94,"Hey all you DJ's doing weddings on the side, how did you get started? What lessons did you learn from your first wedding?",8,DJs,45,"I am considering starting a side-business DJ'ing weddings. I've worked as a stagehand for well over a decade, and know my way around most live lighting and sound equipment, and happen to have everything besides a lighting package ready to go. I'm looking for some stories and wisdom about what it was like to get started DJ'ing weddings. How did you put together your first contract? Or heck, how did you even go about getting booked? What do you use to transport your equipment safely and professionally? How do you price your services? (if it helps, I'm in the upper Midwest).

I have a portable powered PA (tops and bottoms), a small mixer, laptop running Tidal, wireless mics (lavaliers and handhelds), and if things get really serious, a passive 18"" sub. I would look to purchase a lighting package. I'm not someone who looks to nickel and dime, but I am wondering how people go about add-on services and pricing. Ex: We want amplified music at the ceremony and the reception (which IMO would require 2 PA's, since it's not efficient to setup + tear down and move a PA, then do it all again at the end of the night).

95,The most highly anticipated DJ set in the world..,0,DJs,61,"Grimes will play again I suspect.

Moving forward she will have to face the global public again if she expects to maintain this career. Probabilities are that she will perform another gig in the future for the celebrity and money. 

This future gig would now be the most highly-anticipated set of the modern age. We will all be waiting to dissect every second, every move and every decision.

If she expects this attention to go away, the fucking best DJ set of her life will need to be performed, and we will need to see the mixing in action, otherwise everyone will call it out as fake yet again. 

If it goes to shit on this scale again will she bother with this career? Will she vanish?"

I'm a DJ & Producer in my town, and I've performed gigs at various nightclubs here for many years.

I've noticed that some of the clubs where I used to perform have suddenly stopped communicating with me and aren't offering me opportunities like they used to. I'm concerned that this may be because I now work for a potential competitor.

Have any of you experienced something similar? I don't want this job to have a negative impact on my career as an artist.

98,Lower Rate for Future Business,2,DJs,25,"So I just got off the phone with a potential client that asked if I could lower my (already low) rate after receiving my quote. He owns an event company and mentioned he already told his client the DJ budget would be $760 for the 8hr event from another DJ they were going to book quoted them. I quoted him $1000 for the 8hrs, taking into consideration that he mentioned they‚Äôre looking for another DJ for future events. 

Yes I know 1k is already way too low, and I told him my rate is already low for the size of this event (~800 people) but on precidence of working together on future events I am willing to do $800 + lighting rental costs for this event. 

My question is, was this a mistake? Should I have stayed firm on my rate and potentially lose a valuable lead with lots of future events? 

For context he approached me last summer when I was DJing for a golf tournament and mentioned he wanted to hire me for his events, so he already has proof of my skills and professionalism."

100,"Do you ""have"" to play the typical music at a wedding?",0,DJs,80,"Before responding, I know that a good dj will cater the musical preferences of the crowd since its a paid gig and they're paying  you for a service.

With that said, it would be too soul sucking for me to play the same bullshit I hear at literally every wedding. 

My question for experienced wedding DJs, if you play fun up beat music that isn't as known (eg 1mil to 50mil view type tracks) and play styles across a few genres keeping in mind the genre preference of the wedding couple, and combine that with house remixes of classic songs for familiarity while strategically inserting the odd typical song, would crowds respond well to this?

I'm the owner of an Xone PX5 and am seeking feedback from other users of this mixer.

Is this a common experience among other users? I use linear curve settings

I have a simple setup. Laptop to mixer and 2 speaker output. So what I did was took the right speaker and powered the master. The issue is I only get the right channel sound on the restaurants speakers. 

At least if they had a 1/4 mono I could run mono from my mixer and it would sound better. My speakers sound fine, it‚Äôs their speakers that are daisy chaining that sound bad. Is there a solution for this like a splitter that I can go into that will run both my channels output into 1 xlr input and make the daisychain sound half way decent?

122,[help] DMC set with static noise fron turntables as sound source,1,DJs,6,"Hi everyone! Im hoping this community can help me.

I guess DMC Championship is still a relevant event in the modern djing communty, but im trying to recall an specific set from the first decade (or maybe two first decades) where the DJ (and im not sure it was a solo dj or a team, actually think it was a team) they took all Vinyls off the turntables and then pitched the static sounds in order to create a melody with the crossfader. 

If im right that it was a team, they were a pretty strong one (in terms of the djing community back then) but i cant recall the name, and therefore cant find the set. Ive tried google and all the basics but since im not native english i cant find it (specially since there are Dj static and Dj noize that are the results that pop up when trying to search it).

It blew my mind back then and i unlocked the memory recently, but im growing desperate trying to find it

123,"Opinion: InMusic (Denon, Numark, Rane) and other parts of the industry Need to Get their DJ Houses In Order...",21,DJs,82,"I am quite worried about the future of DJing with AlphaTheta's purchase of Serato and unless InMusic (and other players) better structures itself, i don't see a positive future.

The current state of software according to the latest Digital DJ Tips survey is

|Software|Marketshare|
|:-|:-|
|Rekordbox|31%|
|Serato|30%|
|VirtualDJ|14%|
|Traktor|10%|
|Engine DJ|7%|
|Other|5%|
|Djay Pro|3%|

On the hardware side its

|Company|Marketshare|
|:-|:-|
|Pioneer|56%|
|InMusic\*|25%|
|Traktor|8%|
|Others\*|12%|

\* Denon 12%, Numark 9%, Rane 4%  
\*\*Other 2.8%, Technics 2.7%, Hercules 2.6%, Roland 1.7%, Reloop 1.6%, Allen & Heath .6%

Outside of Engine, most InMusic hardware is designed to work with Serato, but has compatibility with other software like VDJ, DJay Pro. This merger is going to give Pioneer / AlphaTheta 61% of software market and will eventually decimate the hardware market.

InMusic doesn't seem to have a solid hardware or software strategy - they created Engine DJ to be embedded only with the desktop software only used to organize libraries and export to portable media. Maybe its because they didn't want to compete with their partner Serato - but their partner Serato will soon be their competitor.

Other brands that collab with serato will soon also see their marketshare diminish.

I believe Pioneer will take the best parts of Serato, implement into RekordBox and slowly disinvest in Serato (or vice versa for more of a money grab). I would love to be proven wrong, but I don't see why they would continue to develop these two softwares separately.

Lastly, it seems like InMusic is experimenting too much with its product lines and oversegmenting. The club level gear for Rane and Denon make sense, but then they release the Denon SC Live 4 which is more akin to the Numark line (which used to be pro before InMusic but is now really consumer only). The Rane One/Four controllers are club quality but not really club gear. Lastly, InMusic seems to be moving many of its Engine controller features to software only - which makes using laptop/software limit access to features. (Example, mic eq on SC Live 4 is accessible via touch screen but if you use Serato/VDJ, you lose access to mic eq)

Not saying other companies are better, but we need the industry to figure itself out before we end up with a bleak future.

125,Asking for an opinion: Trying to make sense to different DJS in a DJ group,4,DJs,45,"A little bit of context before the question:

With another 4 local DJs we have formed a DJs and Event Planner organization that cover only ""darkly oriented"" alternative music. Keep in mind that the ""darkly oriented"" music genres cover a lot of things (from goth rock to darktechno, let me put in this way), and we have different tastes in music and libraries as well.  
Today we are starting to plan the events for next year (so we are also talking of concerts and live act).  


Trying to make sense to our different tastes (and personal libraries) I try to associate every live act for next year to some of the dj.  
It was the most logic thing to me: if we call an Aggrotech band we cannot let a coldwave dj play after, same if we call a darkwave band we cannot let a darktechno dj play after, and so on. The public will be totally different and the dancefloor always empty and/or angry.

The other djs instead are arguing that: ""we can all play every genre, why are you assuming that we can't?"" 

It was a group chat but after that reply I'm honest I was a bit lost and drop the discussion.

For me divide our group in the most effective genre for every dj was the most reasonable solution, I was wrong at assuming this?

We know our style, history and library very well, so we know if one of us can cover a genre or not.

What did you think?   
I was wrong at assuming this kind of separation for future events?

As a 25+ turntablist veteran, I couldn't be more in love with my rig, its my dream setup, but its just not feasible for travel, especially since DJaying has been downgraded to just a hobby. The Rane One looks like my answer. I'm seeing bundle deals that include a flight case for $1600.

Brand new MKii versions of my gear, cases and covers would cost around $3500. How much do you think my used, older version config could be sold for? (never gigged - dust free). 

I'm torn between selling my gear and replacing it the a Rane One (hopefully with a little extra, much needed cash), or biting the bullet, putting it in storage for years and figuring out how to come up with an extra $1600. Please let me know if you think this is crazy talk.

140,Wondering about the A and H - Xone:PX5,7,DJs,20,"&#x200B;

Hello,

My old Korg zero4 mixer finally gave up and died after 15 years. 

I was looking at replacing it with the A and H Xone:PX5 which came out in 2017 and seems to have it's most recent release notes published in December 2021.

I know it's a long shot but i'm wondering if anyone knows if A and H might be discontinuing or updating the PX5 in the next year or so.

I would hate to get one now only to have have the new shiny thing drop right after.

144,Why is autogain so shamed when using Traktor? [see text],17,DJs,106,"So, it's a common refrain that only idiots or noobs use autogain with Traktor. I'm confused by this, and here's why. If you activate autogain, it attempts to set the gain for you. However, you can manually adjust the autogain level, and once you find the right level it is saved. I like this a lot. I manually determined the gain based on levels and perceived loudness, and that info is now saved with the track.

I get that it's pretty stupid to just blindly allow autogain to pick your levels (I can't think of a single example where I didn't adjust the gain manually), but I do not think it is stupid to have a saved gain level based on manual adjustments.

In the dead ass Traktor sub, and to my knowledge here as well, Traktor autogain is universally shit on, and nobody has even mentioned this aspect of using autogain.

Am I stupid?

Thanks.."

The first one was more to get know each other better. After the first interview they asked me to send an email where I explain how exactly I see my music career and after it was sent, they also came to check my performance at the party. After that they disappeared for 3 weeks and a week ago sent me an email offering to meet once more and discuss if and how exactly we could work together. I‚Äôm quite young dj, only about 4 years in a game. Recently I started producing and released my first track. Playing at top venues in Berlin and have a residency, however, the amount of gigs is very low- sometimes I dont have them at all the whole month, sometimes just 2-3 max. And this fact was something that confused them during the first interview.  They told most of gigs should come from a dj, not from them and sometimes its too early for a dj to enter the agency. My point is to help me to enter international market since I only play in Berlin for now. In general their behavior looks a bit confusing for me. Like they are interested in me as an artist, but have some doubts. What do you think about the whole situation and maybe someone have some tips on how to be confident/lead the conversation during the second interview to make this partnership come true? Thanks"

150,DJ gigs at restaurants?,21,DJs,38,"I've been DJing  for about year now, with a few private parties and about 10 gigs at bars that have been pretty successful. These gigs were mostly Saturday afternoons, with a chill day-drinking vibe, and fine house music. The gigs (paid) went great and the owners were always satisfied.

Now, I'm looking to expand my horizons and venture into playing at restaurants. I've noticed a trend in some places, specially in bigger cities, where they're adding a bit of showmanship to the dining experience, like having dancers or circus performers. I've even seen[DJs mixing in restaurants](https://youtu.be/jDvvW0pf8wA?si=D-g65lHpwkQgjid9) on the internet and I love the idea. As a restaurant owner, it's for sure a cool way to add something extra to your place.

I'm curious if anyone here has experience with restaurant gigs. Specifically, I'm wondering about the practical side of things - do most restaurants have decent speakers, or do you need to bring your own gear? Did it take a lot of ""convincing"" to play there? Also, from a broader perspective, how do you view restaurant gigs as a DJ opportunity in general? Couldn't they be a fun and relatively low-effort way to make consistent money compared to the bigger bar and club gigs?

I'd love to hear your stories and thoughts on this!"

152,Ideal Radio Setup - Vinyl & Digital Media Players,0,DJs,3,"I have a radio show I'm looking to improve my setup! Right now I essentially have 2 setups:

2 Pioneer PLX 500 turntables w/ a Headliner R2 Mixer

and a Denon Prime 2

I currently record the radio show strictly from the Prime 2, but I'm looking to have one combined setup where I can mix vinyl & digital tracks.

I am considering a few options and would love any insight you have!

First, I plan to get an XLR mic (Rode, Shure, etc). Second, I plan to upgrade to a Mastersounds Radius 4 MK2. I love rotary mixers and can't afford many of the bespoke brands, so the Radius 4 seems like the one for me. Nonetheless, I'm open to any rotary recs you may have!

Where I really need help is in deciding which digital media players would make the most sense in my setup. I would ideally spend less than $1.5k USD. I'm considering the following (probably used):

XDJ-1000s

XDJ-1000MK2s

XDJ-700s

CDJ-900NXS

CDJ-900

Denon SC5000 & LC6000

I'm not married to any brand or model. My top priorities are connectivity (the whole system just ""works"" together), Ease of use (some people who will be using the set-up aren't super experienced), and hopefully keeping these for a while.

Any thoughts would be much appreciated :)

158,Brining Your Own Equipment to Performance,0,DJs,35,"Was wondering if I could get a bit of perspective from more experienced DJ's about bringing your own decks for your performance, how much of it is an accepted practice vs how much is it a pain in the back-side for promoters/venues.

I would mention the venue in question are just town bars/clubs, a venue for punters to have a Saturday night out, have a few drinks and have fun. I presume that as the venues get larger, its more suitable to use more professional heavy duty equipment.

At a recent open deck spot, I had been given an hour set that stretched out to three.

For me as a DJ, I am inclined to put on a good performance, however when the kit changes often from venue to venue, spending a bit of time assessing the equipment for any deviations from other layouts drew time away from track selection and keeping the crown entertained.

I have been offered a paid spot in a few weeks time, so I feel inclined to put on a good set.

Some of the steps I have in mind is first checking with the promoter/venue,

Then other helpful, preventative tasks, such as coming in early, offering any help around set up, checking my gear and sound, preparing how it will be set up if a deck change is required etc etc. Got no issues paying my dues, just seeing if I would be wasting my time asking if I get any more offers to play in the future.

Hoping to get some feedback, insights and those DJ hot takes like ""if it sounds good""

So, I‚Äôm not a complete technophobe, I have created some tracks over the years using stand alone software and had a play around with some pioneer setups. However I‚Äôm looking to put on some small nights and have the opportunity to DJ at a friends regular night. I have in the past vinyl only and put on my own small acid/Chicago nights which has its own appeal but as I‚Äôll now also be spinning indie music on some of the nights it just isn‚Äôt practical lugging loads of records about. We will still be mixing old skool house and acid for some of the nights, so a controller that is suited to both would also be great. I don‚Äôt have a massive budget as with family commitments and other hobbies I doubt I‚Äôll have loads of time to play around and practice, so too many features may well be wasted on me. 
I have done some research and like the look of either a Traktor setup or a stand alone Numark Pro + but when I do some reading into each things get blurry. Especially from a compatibility standpoint with venues that might expect you to plug and play with their own equipment.

160,What do you do with your phone during sets?,0,DJs,113,"Completely random, but I‚Äôve always wondered what the general consensus is with what DJ‚Äôs do with their phones while spinning? I know the answer will vary from individual to individual.

For example, do you leave it on Airplane/Do not Disturb mode? Do you turn it off completely? Do
You keep it on in case of emergencies? Do you occasionally scroll here or there and then get back to business?

The reason I ask is because I get very easily distracted, and I have often pondered what I would do during a set to prevent accidental muscle-memory scrolling/distractions. I feel like I would leave mine on Do Not Disturb but would have to keep Screentime on for the hour and only let specific contacts send notifications.

I used it from 2009-2012 and could take it out of storage tomorrow for a gig if I wanted to. That being said, what is truly the worst mixer you have used? My vote goes to the Novation Twitch. I bought this when it came out thinking it would be a nice alternative for smaller bars.

The genre I play most is DEEP TECH HOUSE (like Project 89, Kreech, Milion, Harrison BDP and so on) and these days I'm approaching the construction of a djset. I usually catalogue all my songs in the best way i can to play them ""in freestyle"", but sometimes doing like this don't give me the possibility to keep a mood or a ""story"" I want to tell with the music...or simply I don't understand if the flux have the right continuity or not. Somebody tell me, for example, to listen to the drums...that sometimes I started my sets with tracks with a too much ""detailed and complex"" drums...I cannot understand if it's a real important thing or not for people who listen to my gigs.

So here's the question: in your opinion, are there some elements that has to take in consideration (besides key and bpm, of course) to build a real story with music avoiding just putting music you like or that you think people could like most?

I know that everyone have a certain kind of musical taste and that a story belongs to those who tell it, but i think that there's maybe some ""rules"" to follow to keep coherence."

I'm currently using a zoom h1n but unless the input level is set really low, it has a tendency to clip badly.
It's fine for a studio environment but in a club where the levels tend to get pushed up higher it ends up sounding distorted.

Is there a better device available that has a bit more headroom so won't clip as easily?

Back in the day I used to use a mini disc and that was pretty much plug and play, with the internal limiter keeping the levels sounding good. Looking for something like that really.

Cross fader also noisy at times.

I have made sure that there is no clipping going on with the channel gains and master gain. No excessive gain on amp either.

176,How many DBs on the master out?,2,DJs,17,"I had a gig the other week and the sound guy told me to keep the mixer (DJM900nxs2) maxed to 0 DB during my set, which was only to the top of the green bars. I am used to having it maxed in the orange without redlining. I was under the impression I could have the mixer peaking just below the redline and that will keep the audio from distorting then the sound guy can adjust the master levels from their end. 

I noticed some DJ mixers like the DJMs go up to 10 db whereas others like the Rane Four only go up to 0 db.

So is it better to always have the master at 0 DB or should I go louder?  Why the inconsistency between mixers?

Luckily nothing was broken but the incident is forever etched in my mind.  

When I hear people talking about vinyl, the memories flood into my mind and I‚Äôm repulsed. Still spinning today I like the convenience of showing up at a gig with a USB drive and when my friend was poetic about vinyl I don‚Äôt see it.  

I‚Äôd like to think that I‚Äôm over the fall but I legit don‚Äôt see any significant benefit off vinyl over tracks.  

A friend of mine invited me to spin at his house add we really have a good time but sometimes he makes a point to jab at me about playing tracks. I‚Äôve never told him my story and just shrugged it off but he seems to be looking for some validation from me and I‚Äôm trying to be authentic but I feel like I‚Äôm running out of time with him because he keeps bringing it up.

Aren't modern UK, Canada, US listeners more than dancers and so no longer motivated by predictable beats?",0,DJs,80,"Isn't all dance music just selling drugs through the vibes the government is trying to get you to feel? Is there actual product/market fit that is driven by DJs?

Like what's happening to clubs and shows and festivals set up specifically for dancing and selling drugs and alcohol? Is there just too much music? Is the dance vibe just about discovery being mostly through listening in regular life and so we don't have an association with ""dance music"" as such anymore? Is it too many sober people on the dance floor? Too much familiarity with tictoc short form djs and big house drops? 

I wanted to ask analytic type DJs about norm violation in dance music and the whole social psychology of 4 on the floor in the future of dance music. Where is this going except to sell a vibe you're suppose to have? Is there a way out? Can anyone escape the diffusion into a million genres and the monotony of choosing to play whatever is made predictable by corporations? 

Just killing some time, hoping to be proven wrong about Overmono-type music, looking for recommendations on the future of dance music as dance music rather than elsewhere....

--

Watching people from the Overmono boiler room set made me think structual complexity in house music or other genres is not going to be a crowd pleaser until it is because it was defined that way by marketing machines and big money driving culture through repetition.

Difficulty in predicting the transitions, or the thematic vocal driving the vibe, or never getting to a drop, or even the awkward beat structure is as uncomfortable as Jazz progressions that never resolve to tonics. 

Just as a first listen through to Overmono's work, it seems like the exact opposite of dancefloor vibes, even if it is house music or danceable whatever-genre. But look at the dancers in the crowd reacting to transitions. 

I get listening to them in a different context, having them played to add a vibe to a room where you're not focused on dancing, having them on in the car, or putting headphones on and walking around. It's stylistically appealing, it's mood music, it's not fully in the foreground or background.

Every time you see people follow along to their anticlimaxs and then become awkward, self-conscious, bored. Then a new vocal comes on and people are comfortable again.

209,DDJ1000/FLX10 individual deck unit controller,0,DJs,9,"I've been thinking about this for a few years now and I am curious if anyone has too. It seems like a pretty obvious thing to me.

Wouldn't it be amazing if pioneer/alphateta/whatever released a controller that is basically just one deck off of a ddj1000/flx1000? So you can take those and add them as 3d & 4th decks to your ddj1000/flx10 and have a full ddj1000/flx10 4 physical decks controller setup with a laptop. Or add a few to a djm mixer to have the same thing with a laptop while using the djm soundcard. Something similar to a denon's LC6000. I believe the technology is obviously already here. You just need to cut one deck off of a ddj1000/flx10 and have it as a single midi controller. 

I understand that this might damage the cdjs sales, but if I am buying a set of 3000s, for sure I will be using them fully and not just as a glorified controller. They are so much more than just a MIDI keyboard and with a pricetag to fit it too. And from what I've seen in the dj space I believe many people think the same way. So this single deck midi controller would fit in a currently empty market niche (only Denon has something like this with the lc6000. The traktor x1 is different). So if they release a single deck midi controller in the style of ddj1000/flx10 I think it will be a huge hit imo. It will start making the controller market modular and will open the possibility of many new configurations between the already existing gear. 

Let me know what you think. Does it sound like a good idea to you or complete bs? If you agree share your thoughts on would pioneer even want to release such a product. "
210,‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what you can bring to the table next week.‚Äù,6,DJs,34,"
My partner is a DJ. I handle a lot of the backend stuff for him, accounting, website, promo, socials etc. I gig with him often as an assistant/under. He got a gig in Providence at a newish restaurant/lounge in a weird spot off the main strip. Owner hired him for karaoke and to play music between performances every Thursday night. Agreed to pay his fee, said he was gonna make a flyer, promote etc and said he expected it to be slow in the beginning. Partner discussed cash in hand same night for pay. Owner wants to start right away. 

First week is dead. We did our best with promo but the lounge didn‚Äôt promote and didn‚Äôt want us to make a flyer. owner asks if he can pay half the fee since it was dead‚Ä¶ acknowledges the bad weather was a factor whatever. Partner accepts half as goodwill for a regular gig. 

We finally get a flyer and promote all week as best we can but we don‚Äôt pay for ads for businesses giving us a flat fee especially for karaoke so it‚Äôs all organic. We do invest in our promotion for our own organized gigs which have great turnout. But it‚Äôs for mixing sets and the crowd that likes my partner like to dance. Lounge once again doesn‚Äôt promote. Thursday comes, owner starts texting asking how many people are coming. My partner says he got about 30 responses to the fb event he made and he‚Äôs been promoting all week but it‚Äôs another bad weather night (highly walkable area with little parking - bad weather kills foot traffic especially since this place is off the beaten path). Owner says he personally invited 50 people. Cool. Partner asks why owner isn‚Äôt promoting on socials. Owner says they posted once on their story‚Ä¶ and won‚Äôt share our posts because of the ‚Äúghetto‚Äù music on one of them (black eyed peas for those wondering‚Ä¶ üôÑ)

This thursday had like 15 people. Owner acts cool and tells my partner it‚Äôs the weather, yada yada no big deal. But at the end of the night says I‚Äôll pay you at 10 am tomorrow. My partner was hesitant but agreed because the owner seems so sincere. Told him to call at 10 am and he would cashapp him. 

10 came and went the guy won‚Äôt answer the phone or texts. Every couple hours sends us a short text saying he is gonna call basically dicking us around all day. Finally around 3 sends a voice message saying he wasn‚Äôt gonna pay us our full fee again (will only pay half) because my partner didn‚Äôt bring enough people in, and he will get the payment taken care of but he wants to ‚Äúsee what you can bring to the table next week‚Äù. He never sent the money. Big surprise. Not sure if he seriously thinks we are going to continue a business relationship with him. 

I‚Äôm just so sick of these business owners conflating club promoters and DJs. Yes we do promotion but ur paying us to play music. They want us to have viral tik tok levels of followers and reach and make the establishment blow up overnight. For karaoke. And then he can‚Äôt even pay the agreed fee or do his own bare minimum promotion. ü§° Now the whole gig is shitcanned 2 weeks in (for us, anyway). 

I know there‚Äôs nothing to really be done about this situation other than not work with this guy anymore but he sucks and I wanted to vent with some people who can relate to the frustration. If I had been with my partner on this night I would not have agreed to the delayed payment. If they don‚Äôt have the money that night chances are you aren‚Äôt getting paid. In my experience. We‚Äôve run into this situation several times throughout the years and if we are together and in person we can usually get paid with a little pressure. I couldn‚Äôt fathom hiring someone for a gig (and we do put people on to work door for our self-organized events) and then not paying them for showing up and doing their job because I wasn‚Äôt happy with the turnout. We always pay our people. 

TLDR; Providence lounge owner stiffed us for a karaoke gig due to lack of attendance, despite not promoting their own event and expecting us to do all the leg work. "

Go back up your music library like right now (and also...),16,DJs,4,"So it's almost [world backup day](https://www.worldbackupday.com/en) (probably is in some parts of the world) so here's a reminder to go back up your music library. I might be saying this because something happened to me and not just because it's (almost) world backup day; see the note at the bottom.

Follow the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies of your data, on 2 different media, with 1 stored offsite.

My backups personally look like this:

\- 2 external SSD's which are mirrors which I carry to gigs (this satisfies the 2 different media rule)

\- 1 copy on my server at home (this satisfies the 3 copies part, as well as 2 different media in a slightly different way)

\- 1 copy in the cloud (I use Backblaze which this is *not* an advertisement for, there's lots of good options, this is just what I use! This satisfies the 1 offsite copy.)

This is a touch excessive, I know, but it has saved my butt more than once.

And actually, here's an extra tidbit: if you have the ability to *version* your backups, do so. I haven't paid for the versioned edition of Backblaze, but now I'm kinda sad as I realized that my Serato library has been corrupt for some time (missing a bunch of files). I've narrowed that down to about September of last year when I was having some serious drive issues, but I don't have a backup from then to be able to try to merge with my existing library.

Anyway, back up your stuff!"

225,best setup for recording mixes from Xone/Pioneer portably (and maybe vinyl sampling too),2,DJs,9,"hi everyone, i've checked older posts but didn't find a convincing answer so i need your help to find the best setup to safely record our hybrid dj/live mixes from the widest range of mixers found in clubs.

home setup is Xone 92 + XDJ1000 + MC101 or TR8 + TB3, when playing in clubs the mixer is usually Xone 92/96 but we came across any kind of device, from Pioneer V10 to Xone 23 or rotary mixers. reading older posts, budget mobile recorders such as Tascam DR-05X seem the best choice, as they can record into SD card from the external line input and have a decent battery life.

so first basic question is whether we should connect the device to Rec or Booth output on the mixer, and if one of them could allow us to use a standard preset on the recording device without needing to check the audio file each time for clipping.

i've compared the specifications for few commonly found mixers of all price tags (Xone 23/92/96 and Pioneer 450/850/V10) and seems the nominal Rec output has a smaller range when comparing the different models. it stands around -8dBu for all of them except for 23 and 450 (the first one having 0dBu and the second one not having a Rec output at all). Booth output ranges instead from -2dBu on Xone 23/92 up to +6dBu on expensive Pioneer models. so my basic knowledge of the subject tells me the Rec output is the best choice here. if there's something i'm missing please tell me (probably something about nominal/max output or dBu/dBV).

this said, Tascam DR-05X has a maximum input level of -4dBV so i should be able to set its Line input to roughly -6/-15dBV and stay safe while recording mixes on different models, without the need to check specifications for Rec output on each mixer that we come across. in any case, a quick post production will be necessary, at least to give some gain as the audio files will come out at different volumes depending on the mixer we used, but that's not a problem. i just want to make sure that there's no chance of clipping, Logic will do the rest.

so why should i need an attenuator if my conclusions are somehow correct? i'm kind of missing the point of it, and what's the difference with a good quality shielded RCA cable combined with the correct input setup on the Tascam.

last short questions, is there any reason to invest some additional money into mid range models, such as DR-40X or Zoom H4n, or maybe wait to find a second hand deal? i don't care too much about field recording or 4 tracks splitting so is there any better feature for the external line input (less distortions or whatever)?

last one for real, any chance i can connect the Tascam directly to a Mixars STA turntable to sample some vinyl? no Rec, just Line out so i guess the output will be way stronger (could be around +50 dBV if my doubtful conversion isn't too bad). there's no GND on this turntable so i don't need a wire, but i can imagine that's way too much for the Tascam so i will have to go through a mixer.

cheers to you if you managed to read all"
226,Exploring Key Mixology: Classic vs. Alphanumeric Approach,0,DJs,4," 

Hello!

I've been DJing for over 10 years, and I've always been interested in musical keys for my mixes. They bring coherence to all the sets I create. Up until now, I've always used the classic referencing method, but then I discovered Alphanumeric and Kamelot's wheel.

For those who aren't familiar, there are plenty of resources on YouTube on the subject.

My question is: What do you use? Classic or Alphanumeric?

Also, what are, for you, the best key combinations that might not seem logical but sound good together?

I've never learned music other than through DJing, so sorry if I offend the purists; I'm just trying to do my best.

The mixer runs out to a pair of Klipsch The Fives and a relatively cheap sub that sounds great in my smaller room. 

All in all it‚Äôs a fantastic setup and I‚Äôm very happy with how it sounds.

It doubles as a mixing setup as well as a hi-fi listening set up. Lately I‚Äôve been really enjoying jazz and doing a lot of listening and collecting vinyl, buying particular pressings and really zoning in on the specific listening experience of each pressing. 

With this being said I‚Äôm aware that the weakest link sound wise in my set up is the DJM mixer and I found a XONE 32 mixer for cheap on marketplace that I‚Äôm going to go check out this evening. 

I know that the A&H mixers are known for great sound and that they are fully analog and I‚Äôm looking forward to making the switch. I‚Äôm wondering though if I could tap this community for some anectdotes before I pull the trigger. How much better will the new analog Xone mixer actually sound based on the set up I‚Äôve got?

My sound is a mix of trance, organic house, folktronica, dnb, with a splash of shrooms. I like to layer tracks heavily. Not into scratching. I don't want to press a bunch of buttons with stupid noises. I just want my vinyl to work along side my digital music and I want to be able to extremely refine the sound. I want the dopest mixer for that.

I was recording and 40 mins in so I thought I'd re-do, so re-loaded tune B to the deck to get back to 172 BPM, skipped back a ways on tune A and then noticed it was playing at 86 BPM!

238,Best Option For Motorized Platters Under $800,6,DJs,20,"I'm looking to get back into DJing after years of not having time. I'm looking for something that feels as close to vinyl as possible. I had turntables years ago when I first learned and then also had Numark CDXs later. I liked them because it felt close enough to vinyl for me. 

What I'm trying to do: 
Mix and scratch hip-hop at home. 

What I need: 
Large jogwheels
Responsive feel for scratching. Preferably as close to vinyl as possible. 

What I would like to have:
Motorized platters

Don't need:
4 deck capability 

I've looked at the Hercules Inpulse T7. It honestly looks like it checks the boxes of what I want and need. I'm not familiar with recent Hercules stuff, only from years ago when it was basically looked at like toys. 

I'd like to stay below $800. In all honesty I'd like to be closer to $500-600 max if possible. I've found the T7 for about $600. Unless I've missed it I haven't really found anything else with motorized platters in that range. 

Anyone have the T7 and do a lot of scratching? How has it been? Would you recommend it? Anything else that I'm missing that would be a better option? Any help is appreciated! "
239,Tool to compare Spotify playlist with local files and tell em what I‚Äôm missing,6,DJs,16,"I know this is maybe a bit of a niche ask, but is anyone aware of a tool that can compare a Spotify playlist to a playlist on my laptop and tell me what tracks are missing? 

I use Spotify when I‚Äôm on the go to build playlists and then I download the tracks and put them into Apple Music, then sync to each of the different dj softwares I need (Primarily Rekordbox and Engine). Sometimes though I miss tracks, or add another track later, or my budget prevents me getting every track on the playlist, so the playlists on Spotify maybe don‚Äôt necessarily match the ones I have locally. 

Is there any tool I can use to compare my Spotify playlists to what is on my local apply music, Rekordbox or Engine? I just want it to tell me what is missing. 

Note - I‚Äôm not interested in migrating playlists to Apple Music, I know that‚Äôs a thing already, but doesn‚Äôt help me because I can‚Äôt use them for DJ‚Äôing. "
240,Roland DJ 808 in 2024,4,DJs,13,"Hoping to get input on buying a used Roland DJ 808 in 2024. I know it‚Äôs a little dated when you think of the number of controllers that have been released since 2016, but my focus has been making beats for awhile now and the dj808 seems to be the best tool for the producer-DJ. I imagine I can sketch out beats from loops on serato and connect to my drum machine or use the 808 section to layer drums. There‚Äôs no other DJ hardware with a midi out. I‚Äôve also seen my two favorite producers use it up to even recently (Pete Rock and Alchemist), which shouldn‚Äôt matter but heck, I want to emulate my idols. 

My main concerns for the DJ 808 are that 1) it‚Äôs discontinued by Roland so finding replacement parts might be a hassle, 2) it‚Äôs not built like a brick (also considering a Rane One, which is a tank), 3) the producer set up I imagine will end up being too complicated to sketch out beats and I‚Äôm left with useless features (I like gorilla beat making on my sp-404)

The reason why the Rane One is appealing to me is because I imagine being more comfortable with it DJing at say a backyard function. It‚Äôs minimal, would be more natural for me to scratch with (used to use turntables for DJing way back when), and has a solid build for mobile use. For beat-making, it has an AUX in which is minimally all I need to sketch a beat out. 

TLDR: get the DJ 808 for its producing features even though it‚Äôs discontinued, or get something new and not worry about the producing aspect.

242,My Xone 42 cue/mix plays the channel down in mix mode (when CUE is active). Is wrong???,2,DJs,9,"Hi everyone,

Reciently I purchased for a second hand Xone 42 with a very nice look aspect and functionally everything seems to work well.

But...there is something that is driving me crazy... I ussually play with headphones (no monitors) at home by volume and neighbors...and for me it¬¥s very important using continuously the cue/mix knob in order to beatmach the fader down channel with fader up channel and mix both channels precueing in live mode.

Well it¬¥s normal for everyone, but...when I received this mixer, I took account that..if I have channel A with fadder up..it is being listened in mix ..ok everything ok, but, If I have the channel B playing but with FADER DOWN AND CUE selected, it also is being listened with knob turned to MIX completly!!

It has no sense for me! because I lose track of what is sounding outside and inside.

Is it a normal function of this mixer? or it¬¥s wrong??? because I see a lot of djs (some time ago) playing with this mixer at home with no issues.

Thank you very much for your support and answers!"
243,How wrong is this person on a scale from 1-10,0,DJs,19,"Hello Reddit this is my first post. I found a very interesting specimen. I am not a professional career DJ but I do have some experience, played along some relatively big names. So I think I am knowledgeable enough to have a little discussion. Now I met this guy, probably a troll, that pretends to be a Radio DJ in the Uk. He‚Äôs apparently playing 8 decks at once, loves to sync, is shitposting while on air for the whole uk, he loves to mix basslines and if things get tricky -> b2b! Besides that all his sets are behind paywalls, something I also never heard of. 

The discussion began around why the sync button can be dangerous, for example when rekordbox did not properly analyse the track, placing the grid incorrectly. Happened to me more than once when I started playing on proper equipment and tried to save a messed up transitions with the sync button, which made it even worse. I also think playing manually keeps the spirit of djing and keeps you aware and on your toes, helps you not overdoing your mix. 

I will post some citations and invite you all to make fun of it and feel free to elaborate why the things said are complete bullshit 

Enjoy: 

‚Äû Had 8 decks on the flow yesterday, all in turn. Synced now and then to bring them in, when things turned tricky. B2B.‚Äú

‚Äû you have no idea. Being able to sync now makes you able to bring other parts of the music in as opposed to keeping your fingers on the vinyl to keep synced. It's opened things up but of course you obviously wouldn't know ;)‚Äú 

This one is interesting he is able to use the sync button on vinyls

‚ÄûIf you can't mix a bass line, that shows how shit you are. That's EXACTLY what you should be doing. Fuck me

I make bass lines sound good together. That's the difference between me and you ;)‚Äú 

Obviously most electronic music has to heavy bass to properly mix it, and it‚Äôs usually clear that the transition point sits where the new bass line is introduced. I think that applies to techno, house, dnb, hardcore and hip hop. But the hero here is better than all of us.

‚Äû 6 decks, two rooms.; the main and the chill out. (two rooms and yet you probably think you're good with two decks whilst not getting paid). All broadcast at the same time. Bitch thinks she knows shit XD on pathetic equipment. Better yourself.‚Äú

248,A couple fun tricks to be able to improvise your dj sets and avoid pre-planning.,66,DJs,51,"I see it all the time. Where djs have their entire set figured out before they even arrive at the club. Without going into my opinion on that too deeply, I will provide some ways I have used over the years to always be able to improvise my sets. A very rewarding feeling to be able to adjust what I am doing to what I see on the floor and have it work. Whereas if I had it all planned out and saw my idea fall flat, what then?

1. Organize your music library based on the vibes you play. Inside my House folder I have playlists. !House\_All is where everything goes no matter what. ""-bpm"" playlist is for tracks that are slower than 120bpm. ""+bpm"" is for tracks above 130bpm. Another separate playlist for every subgenre of house I mess with. Whenever a new track is added to my collection I simply drag a copy of the track to every applicable playlist. I also have playlists dedicated to energy levels. A playlist called ""early glow"" for music that would get people dancing if they are not, but not in a pushy way. Traktor users who know about preparation playlists can gets tons of mileage organizing their music using them almost like a cheat code. 
2. For a gig, make a playlist adding way more music than you expect to have time to play. Practice sets with the playlist and don't adhere to an order. Hopefully the playlist has changes in energy levels from one song to another. So now it's on you to match those with what you see on the dance floor in realtime.

Just keeping a couple habits like this has allowed me to improvise every set I have played. I can switch out of my gig playlist to another that matches a vibe the crowd latches onto very quickly without much thought. So I am not rummaging through a large collection and having that take too much time."

Is this always done via extra decks (a few k $$$ for an extra loop just doesn't seem like the most efficeient way)?

257,My DDJ-1000 decided it didn't want to turn on at my monthly event yesterday‚Ä¶,8,DJs,24,"I had used it just that morning before I unplugged evertything from it and packed all my gear in the car. Got to the bar, got all my gear setup, but since I got there early, I failed to power everything on until it was time for me to play. That was a mistake. I had this issue once before, and since I live less than a mile from the venue, I took the controller, cables and computer home for testing and it powered up just fine. At the time, I chalked it up to operator error (I figured I didn't seat the power or USB cable properly). But yesterday, I did the same thing and it would not power on despite trying different cables.

I think it's a hardware issue and I'm pissed at the design of the power adapter plug into the unit. I learned it's not good for consistent gigging aka constant plugging/unpluging of the power adapter. I've owned it since April of 2020 and despite the one hiccup last year. Since June of last year, I've used it in the wild - meaning I've had to plug/unplug it at least once a month to bring it to the bar.

Now, I'm looking at a XDJ-XZ or XDJ-RX3. I'd love to get a couple XDJ-1000mk2's and a DJM-750mk2, but since I'm trying to save for a home in the future, I can't really justify the cost of the modular setup. I do plan to eventually send the DDJ-1000 for repair. I hope it can be repaired because I'd like to use it as a backup. Lesson learned: HAVE A BACKUP IF YOU'RE GIGGING!

I'd LOVE to have a modular setup, but currently, I'm only playing the bar, streaming on Twitch, recording mixes a few times a year, and just mixing for fun whenever‚Ä¶ And if I start getting back to playing venues/events/clubs, I would probably be booked via a promoter, so they should have the pro gear (DJM-900nxs2/CDJ-3000s/etc.), so I just show up with my headphones and USB drives. I like having a 4-channel setup of the XZ but the RX3 seems more portable and has a much better screen - it's also $400 cheaper than the XZ. If I were to get the XZ, I would probably never get a modular system until the XZ dies lol.

Anyway, this long-ass post was to vent my frustration and any advice/suggestions would be great."

I remember reading an article mentioning that Bandcamp is working on bringing some features back or improving the discovery process, but details were a bit vague. Does anyone know if there's a timeline for when these features might return? It's been a bit frustrating trying to navigate through the platform without them.

Also, I can't help but wonder about the decision-making process behind removing such key features. It seemed like Bandcamp was on a good path toward enhancing music discovery. If anyone has insights or updates on this, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

262,Collection Management and gigging question,0,DJs,4,"Hey friends, used to be an old turntable dj back in teh late 90's/early 00s and retired for about 15 years.  Long story short I've returned to the scene and have been working hard the last year to get caught up with the new techniques and equipment and one thing seems to be tripping me up a little more than I would expect... collection.

Back in the day it was easy to keep things organized because you had a couple record crates and could keep things visually how you needed them.  That and long blends and longer songs were more common so you played less songs so you didn't need a huge collection.

So I've got things pretty trim, as I do multiple kinds of gigs so it's easy to keep a playlist of ""corporate gigs"" and ""X genre"" type of things... but I also have been getting attention and gigs for my actual harder funky DJ stuff that I did back in the day.  I used to show up to multiple Open Decks in a week with a USB of 100 songs I knew I wanted to highlight and just freestyled... but now that I'm getting full sets booked, I worry that there will be too much overlapping and that anyone who sees me will hear 25% of my ""keepers"" on any given gig if I just stick to 100-ish tracks.  Granted that 100 will be refined as I hear new stuff I want to play, but still there will obviously be my favorites on that stick.

So my question for established DJs who book regular club gigs and EDM gigs (not laptop driven multi-hour wedding or corporate gigs)...  Even if your collection is 1000+ songs... how many do you take to a typical gig and do you just expect that people will hear a few of the same tracks if they come out and support you often?  ESPECIALLY if you're known for playing a specific type of EDM?"

And I have been doing it for some quite time (few years). I'm not preforming a lot, but every 2-3 months I have something. Throughout the years I have encountered various problems with the system that I want to overcome.

1. My library is on external hard drive and I'm using MacOS. I had few times that I needed to change my computer to a new one. What I usually do is to just drag and drop the files into iTunes and then recreate the smart-playlists that I had, as well as playlists that I created (usually sets that I preformed / recorded). The thing is that the to recreate the smart-playlists is an annoying process which I need to remember the rules. What is the best way to overcome this? is there a way the library structure and playlist could be kept, so when I switch computer one day I can be sure that it will be an instant thing?
2. When I export in rekordbox I do it from iTuens API, I don't drag into rekordbox. What is the safest way to make sure I won't lose cue points that I set into Rekordbox? "

273,Online DJings - What results in followers/audience?,7,DJs,10,"So I trip out sometimes how like well known artists and DJs don't have as many viewers on Twitch or Youtube as some no name DJ that we've never heard of. For instance, Lord Finesse streams every Saturday AM. He has like 300 - 400 people in his chat, and he's work with the likes of Big L, DJ Premier, and other well known people in hip hop. He's part of D.I.T.C and has a long history in music. But another unknown DJ I'll catch on Twitch has like 1k+ people watching him DJ. Same thing with Easy Mo Bee. He streams on Twitch late at night on Friday nights and Saturday nights, but he doesn't get many viewers from what I've seen. That guy has worked with Notorious BIG and many other well known artists.

There's other examples of that, so I was wondering like what gets you an audience on Twitch or Youtube? Are these no name guys just marketing and advertising their stream on social media more/better or what? What do you guys/gals think about it? Peace and stay up!"
274,DJ Harvey‚Äôs Klymax Discoteque in Bali,17,DJs,9,"I had the chance to visit DJ Harvey‚Äôs magnum opus club last night, called Klymax Discoteque. Paul Woodford was playing all night long. 

The place is an absolute dream of a venue. Kind of a hidden entrance on the side of a hill, with not a trace of sound coming out of it. Then you enter through the reception, down a flight of stairs and into this incredibly curated, beautifully crafted dream of a club environment. 

Sprung wooden dance floors, no tables for bottle service, mind blowing, crystal clear 4 point speaker system, discrete DJ booth tucked away in the wall above the dance floor, beautiful haze and elegant, minimal lighting. Just the cr√®me of the crop for the kind of eyes closed, pure sound dancing experience a lot of us crave and grew up on. 

The problem was the crowd. The vibes were shit, at least for the couple of hours we were there. Paul Woolford is an absolute god and the music was incredibly on point, the venue was divine, but most of the crowd had this kind of Uber hipster, too cool for school, fashionista attitude that just sucked. No passion, no energy, no commitment, as the meme goes. 

I could have closed my eyes and just jammed in this womb of pure sound and still had a great time, but my friends were really not feeling it so we ended up leaving around 2 and going somewhere else (which was a disappoint to me but we were a big group so wanted everyone to feel comfortable). 

I‚Äôm by far the most purist and experienced raver in the group, and this place is designed especially for people like me. So it could just be my friend‚Äôs attitudes sucked, but the truth is the vibe of the rest of the crowd was pretty lame too. 

Has anyone else visited and had a different experience? Maybe it was just an off night or my friend‚Äôs shitty attitude couldn‚Äôt appreciate it or coloured my experience? Does the crowd ever really pop off and go wild, doing justice to the love and care of Harvey and the designers of this incredible gem?

Just curious if anyone else has had an experience of this, because crowd last night aside, it‚Äôs pretty much the closest thing to perfect I‚Äôve ever seen. 

Hopefully I can go again tonight to see Chaos in the CBD and maybe the vibes and crowd will be different. It‚Äôs definitely an aficionado‚Äôs paradise, just seemed to be too few aficionados and too may posers / cool kids there when I visited last night.

ALWAYS have a backup laptop

NEVER update 2 days before a gig

the crowd doesn't really care at all as long as there's any music playing (Sofyware keeps crashing? just DJ the files raw thru a media player)

If you're very tall, point that out to the organizer so they'll get you a fitting table to set up on - will save you a lot of lower back pain

When asking someone for a slice of pizza midset, don't say ""I don't mind the topping"" that's how you end up with pineapple pizza

276,New turntable ,0,DJs,8,"Hi gang,
A while back I sold my Reloop RP8000 MK2's and I regret it.
Recently I decided I want to digitalise you vinyl collection but I don't have the budget to shell out for a technics 1210 or another Reloop. I liked the Pioneer plx-500 but I heard they have motor/platter issues so now I'm searching again. 
I have a budget of ‚Ç¨300 to ‚Ç¨600. 
What can you recommend that's direct drive, similar to either a Reloop or Technics in features but with a more budget friendly price?
Thanks in advance."
277,Recording Vinyl for playing out on XDJ/CDJ's,2,DJs,5,"Hi all

Looking for some advice on the best way to go about recording some of my records with my current setup for use at gigs. I do buy digital copies of everything i can get hold of online, or buy the tracks on CD & rip if there is a cd release available. Some of my older music, white labels etc ive not been able to find so would like to rip them from wax. Setup is as follows -

Pioneer XDJ-XZ
2 x Reloop RP7000 Mk2
Reloop Concorde carts & stylii (i believe they are just rebadged Ortofon Pro S Mk1)
Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 3rd gen interface
Macbook Pro Mid 2012 & MSI Windows gaming laptop with Serato Dj Pro, Ableton, Garageband & Audacity
2 x 'classic' Technics-style headshells with Stanton 500 carts (i dont think the stylii are genuine Stanton, most probably copies)

Ive tried recording direct from vinyl to USB stick on the XZ & it sounds ok, not sure how well the recordings will hold up next to 'new' digital wav's & mp3's on a big system. I'm using the turntables thru the 'Line' inputs on the XZ as they have line-level output as well as phono (presuming line level is the way to go as Pioneer's phono pre-amps seem to be regarded as poor).

Have also tried recording through the Scarlett to computer & to me the recordings sounded a lot more 'flat' & quieter than direct to USB.

There's so much info online about this its pretty overwhelming, most of it from 'audiophile' types rather than gigging dj's. Should i buy a vinyl cleaning machine? What cart & stylus to use? Do i need an expensive phono pre-amp? Cork or rubber turntable mats? So much info i just dunno where to start üòµ‚Äçüí´

Would be nice to get some ideas from working dj's who have had decent results playing vinyl rips alongside digital downloads on club systems.

I play House/Garage/UKG so decent bass & crisp vocals from the recordings are a must. Thanks for reading üëçüèª

278,Where do people chill with music?,23,DJs,48,"Specifically, what kind of event or venue have you guys experienced where people enjoy some ""background dance music"" (that isn't a club or a rave, and there isn't even a dance floor). I work a day job and I happily sit in my chair and listen to Deep House, Dub-House, Dub-Techno, Minimal, Lounge, etc. ""IDM"" I guess? Maybe? Anyway. It's like 98% 4-on-the-floor kicks but it's pretty chill, no bangers - all ""vibey"" kind of stuff. I'm not dancing. It's not after 10pm. But it's just the music I love, all day, any time, anywhere. I can't be the only one. Just feels like there's got to be a place where people would vibe to that kind of DJ/mix, but I don't know what it is.

Opening night at an art gallery comes to mind. Or some kind of ""afters"" lounge maybe.

Has anyone else had success with making this kind of event work? If so, please share your thoughts.

I just want to fade back into the corner and play a 4-hour set, from like from 8-12pm at a sit-down place where people are chilling, sipping cocktails, the lights are low, the music isn't loud as fuck, but the bass is heavy, the energy is chill and slightly high-end, ya know? Bonus points for couches. All I ask from the audience is a few head bobs here and there as I look out over the room. Maybe a finger gun or two as people walk by to use the restroom. This would be heaven.

I'm happy to seek that out and/or put on my own night someplace, if I could find the right place. Just curious if anyone else has some *kind* of event or venue that comes to mind. Meanwhile, I'll make a couple demo mixes and start a list of possible venues in my town...

Example track with the right feel:

&#x200B;

So far I'm thinking:

‚Ä¢ Art gallery opening night

‚Ä¢¬†Wine bar

‚Ä¢ Fancy Cocktail bar

EDIT TO ADD:

‚Ä¢¬†Record Shop

‚Ä¢¬†Pool Party

‚Ä¢ Yacht Party

‚Ä¢¬†Rooftop Bar

I know there's a lot of debate around what is and what isn't deep house - I'm not particularly keen on the stuff filling up Beatport etc, but I am happy to be swayed. My only rule is: no EDM.

Come and have a look! Posts some tracks. Debate whether Qwazars is deep house or dub techno... or neither.

Look, I get it - flexing is part of the job, to an extent. You have to be able to show confidence in yourself and in your craft. But it irks me when DJs (especially new ones) feel this certain entitlement to act and speak as if they're the heroes sent down to earth to ""save"" the industry.

285,Is it worth starting my library from scratch?,3,DJs,11,"Initially when I started DJing and I was focused on building my library. Back then it was about quantity vs quality. Being a beginner back then, I bought into they hype of Platinum Notes 4 and ran what is now my 6000+ track library through it. Recently, I've been seeing the ad to update to PN 10. Naturally, I searched the web to see if the upgrade was worth the cost and came across some previous posts here and in r/DJCircleJerk about how it's likely making my music worse, not better. 

Now that I am more focused on not just the quality of songs I have, but the sound quality as well, my question is: 

1. Did I screw myself over running everything through PN 4?
2. Is it worth it for me to start my library over from scratch?

287,What do you think about DJs that don't dance or show much emotion?,51,DJs,186,"Do you think it's a negative thing or a disadvantage if a DJ doesn't really dance/groove with the music or look like they're not having fun? Sorry if there are already similar posts like this, but I kind of wanted to share a bit more about my personal story. 

I ask this question because that's literally me as a DJ and I'll explain why. First of all, I love DJing and it is one of my happy places whenever I get behind the decks playing to a crowd. However, I'm very shy, introverted, awkward, self-conscious, have social anxiety, probably on the autism spectrum....you name it. I've never been a dancer or ever felt comfortable trying to dance either. 

I've been trying to improve recently, but while DJing I'd mostly be head down with a serious face. One reason for this is because I get laser focused on mixing so it looks like I'm taking an exam or something. At most, I might bob my head a few times here and there and smile when friends or crowd members are into my set and get my attention.

You might ask why do I even DJ? Again, it's one of my happy places and I get lost in the music/mixing even if it appears differently. I feel like DJing is also a way to help me express myself or release some of my emotions through the music I play. Physically, some head bobbing and smiling is probably the best I will ever be able to do. I can't force myself to dance because it comes unnatural. I've accepted it's just who I am and I can't bring myself to fake anything. Overall, I'm ok with all this about myself as a DJ but what are your thoughts? 

What do you think about DJs that don't dance or show much emotion? Are we at a disadvantage? Also, if anyone else is going through something similar...how are you dealing with it? Is it just what it is or are you trying to do something about it.

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any comments."
288,Facing difficulty in getting my style heard,4,DJs,44,"I'm going thru a tough time lately. I haven't played any gig in 3 months and it seems like things won't get any better. The reason being - I don't play the music that everyone else is playing

Let me paint the picture for you....So, I'm a DJ and producer from India and have been active in my local scene for 2 years now. I like making & playing house music and really melodic stuff. Recently, I've been offered a full time residence at a bar. The pay is good and I was really considering to take it. But the owner wants me to quit playing what I like and play all the generic bollywood music. 

I really don't like playing those songs and recently it's starting to feel like I'm getting outcasted because of that reason. The scene in my city is really closed off for any newcomer and the only way to get any gigs is by compromising what you love playing and do what the promoter wants you to do. 

I'm really struggling financially and I've now faced with this situation of either giving up on my music or be bullied by the promoters to get whatever gigs they offer me. 
What should I do according to you guys? "

292,Is 1760$/1600‚Ç¨ for a complete nexus 1 setup worth it?,0,DJs,19," Saw it on marketplace. I currently have an RX2. I'm playing electronic music in clubs/events sometimes, and I think they would really help me to stay used to CDJ's instead of one screen of a controller.

I am aware of the key differences between nexus 1 and nexus 2 - less hot cues, no beat jump (which is the worst one, I use this a lot if I accidentally get out of phrase), worse sound quality (but does that matter when its for home use only?), no technical support/repair anymore. Also it's without a flight case, but again, doesn't matter since it will be for home use only. But the lowest I've seen complete nexus 2 setup go for is 4400$.

In the future I am very interested in start to mix with even more decks, CDJ's or turntables.

I do feel like I'm well informed, but in general would love some second opinions.

293,What are the realities of live streaming?,0,DJs,46,"Hello.

  
To clarify i'm talking about live streaming/broadcasting DJ sets (as opposed to sourcing music from streaming services)

First post. I've been away from Djing for 15 years or more. Started on vinyl around 1990, ended up with a macbook + serato + turntables around 2005? Anyway, I'm getting back into it (with an ipad initially) and I'm interested in live streaming which I didnt even take much notioce of during the pandemic, so to say I'm novice is putting it mildly

Having done some very quick research, I'm wondering about legalities. I understand you can get away with it? But I'd rather do it properly (as a copyright holder I'm not against hobby DJ's being able to live stream and promote music, but on a more professional level rights holders should get paid - but lets not get sidetracked with that debate).

I'm also wondering about live streaming to bars. Most bars should have a license, but also i imagine most major social live streams will shut you down, so thats not gonna work, right? Or wrong? Or nobody cares?

So, legally what are the realities?

Is there a way i can play anything I want it without licensing it individually, directly (not gonna happen obvs)? Any services that provide for this (paying is fine within reason)?

Then again, let's say you go live on the main social platforms, what is the reality of that, not just legally, but technically, mentally etc?



Thanks"

Quick backstory‚Ä¶
I work for an AV integrator we do mostly conference rooms and public access broadcast systems. 

We have a client that we work with a few times a year that builds out  trade show trucks for festivals. 
Think a box truck that is custom branded with added features of the product they are selling and to hand out merchandise at these festivals and trade shows.

We outfit a few of these with speakers and amps connected to a simple multi-channel mixer that is for a local music source and mics. With connections for outside vendors or whatever they want to bring to these festivals. They typically hire local talent to do these events. 

So here is my question‚Ä¶
We have been asked to spec an all in one DJ system for the next truck they are looking at the Pioneer XDJ-XZ or Rane Four. Both are 4 channel units similar feature and support Serrato. However our stance has always been let the talent bring in there gear and connect to the system. We provide xlr, rca and I believe even a usb link. 

Are we totally off base with that line of thinking? If so what would be a system to provide a local DJ for a gig that is typically a day maybe 3?

Thoughts ideas and comments welcome."
297,External effects unit that also includes a compressor?,0,DJs,11,"Anyone aware of any offboard, external effects unit that can be used with a DJ mixer that also includes a compressor?

I'm currently on a Xone 96, looking to upgrade my setup for stems and flexible tempos. I'll be mixing older tracks from the 60s and 70s that aren't remasters so the tracks aren't as hot and have more dynamic range, which doesn't work as well for mixing on top of modern dance music.

My solution was to get an RNC1173 compressor to use on a send channel, but now I'm thinking I'd like a whole effects unit that also has a compressor on it.

Ideally it would be designed for DJing but I don't think there are any that include a compressor. Maybe a some kind of live audio mastering unit?"

327,Underground Rave !!,2,DJs,45,"Hey all, 

So i‚Äôm planning on throwing an underground rave / bush doof in some nearby parklands in over a months time. I have some experience in planning and organising events before but none of this scale. I‚Äôm planning to have around 500 people there, the event will be outdoors obviously and will involve quite a bit of effort. It will go from about 10pm to sunrise, to give us a chance to clean up while it‚Äôs light. 

I‚Äôm here to mainly ask about equipment. My friend has XDJ XZ for decks which should be fine as i‚Äôm not interested in renting CDJS for this. I have about 5 djs lined up for the night so far and was wondering if a few more would be good or should I have longer sets instead? 

I‚Äôm also interested on some advice of sound system and lighting requirements. I‚Äôve lined up 2x QSC KW152 speakers and 4x EV ETX18SP subwoofers which I think should do the trick. 

In terms of lighting, i‚Äôm thinking of getting some red / purple wash lighting and an AVE ECLIPSE CLUB 1000MK2 for lasers. The lasers will be slightly angled to avoid them pointing to the sky and endangering air traffic. I‚Äôd love some recommendations on specific wash lights that could be suitable for hire for the event. 

The main thing I need advice on is a generator. I‚Äôve constantly been told an inverter is much better in this situation so that‚Äôs probably what i‚Äôm going to go for. I was just wondering with the above information how much power would the generator need? I‚Äôve been recommended 6000-8000W, would this be ok?

I have a 6x3 Metre gazebo organised to cover the dj and equipment and am going to put 5x 2x2 Metre temporary steel fencing in front of the dj and speakers to protect the equipment from drink spills / other issues. 

I‚Äôve organised a team of around 10+ so far for setup, security, crowd control and medial assistance. 

I‚Äôm planning to have about 300+ water bottles available for those in need as this won‚Äôt cost too much and i‚Äôm sure would be helpful. We have prepared a bunch of garbage bags for the cleanup afterwards and i‚Äôm planning to place some temporary bins around the area to try and reduce the inevitable rubbish issue in the first place. 

30 days before the event I‚Äôll create a private instagram account and gatekeep the location until on the day to avoid police presence and unwanted patrons. The location is quite far from houses and I am doing everything in my power to prevent this from being shut down by police and to be a safe and fun night for all. 

That‚Äôs about it for now, id really appreciate some recommendations and advice from people with or without experience in this area. 

Apologies for formatting typed on phone, thanks !!

Edit 1 - 
This isn‚Äôt an official event, it‚Äôs meant for fun and it doesn‚Äôt need the most overly loud sound system or excessive catering for guests, they know what they are getting themselves into by attending.

Edit 2 - 
There won‚Äôt likely be 500 people there, this is a pure maximum amount, the actual amount will likely be between 100-300."

342,effect station with 4-8 beat loop ?,2,DJs,12,"Hello, I am looking for an effect gear, like the rmx-1000 but with a looper capable of doing 4 or more beats, since rmx-1000 can only loop 2 beat.   
I am trying to emulate the function on the xone db4, that can loop 4 beats so is possible to operate effects on the loop while the song still going on playing in another channel.   
My xone db4 unfotunately appear to output kind of a metalic sound, I dont know why, so I think i am going to change it.  
My current setup is  Denon SC6000 -> xone db4 (loop+effect on single channels) -> rmx-1000  (effects on master)

How many benefits is on SX series compare to Numark NS4FX ?

I doesnt care about rekord box just want make some decent mixes at home without random lags and stutering on Windows i think Serato is better option here .

When you have something better i just want 2 things XLR output , portable system and 4 channels are not important .

I gonna be really thankful for every answer here ."
347,ZipDj Record pool quality control,7,DJs,35,"Hey guys,

I‚Äôve recently grabbed a load of tracks from zipdj. Some of them are clearly, without any doubt really low quality in terms of sound output, like terrible in comparison to other tracks. (I‚Äôll dig through and compare them properly at some point) 

I was messing about at home the other day, just mixing anything and everything as I do and not putting any thought or effort into things, just literally getting to know my music.

So I‚Äôm not paying too much attention and I mix in a track to find its stupidly quiet and muffled, it honestly sounds like a terrible rip.

Is it safe to assume zipdj and maybe other pools don‚Äôt give a shit and just want volumes of audio?

On a side note, any record pools offering lossless quality?

Thanks 


Edit*

Sorry guys, I‚Äôm now guilty of not providing enough info.

I found a track that‚Äôs a good example of my issue, it‚Äôs not the same one, but boy does it sound shit!

Just to be clear, this was downloaded directly from ZipDJ, yet a it‚Äôs a remix of an older song but I fail to see how that‚Äôs relevant in terms of audio quality?

If anyone has zipdj, please feel free to search the following track
Amigos (EP) Let‚Äôs Kick It (Original Mix) - Fer BR, Paco Osuna, Inglesias, Manu Gonzalez- [54765607]

Spek won‚Äôt install on either my Mac or MacBook.

Fakin the funk lists this particular file as 128kbps - the frequency spectrum showing a fairly consistent audio file but at 16,540.

 Not that it matters, but to offer some insight, I‚Äôm a techno dj, but grabbing a load of house tech and other stuff for a yacht party which is why I‚Äôm grabbing loads of tech house and other genres I wouldn‚Äôt normally, I also purchase everything I play at festivals in AIFF format normally but on occasion I‚Äôll use a 320kbps mp3, this audio file I absolutely wouldn‚Äôt / couldn‚Äôt though.

Your thoughts please?

355,Hey Everyone - Record Shorter Sets!,0,DJs,50,"I started DJing a long time ago and the standard then for a set seemed to be an hour to 80 minutes. I suspect because of this - If you can produce an hour plus that demonstrates you can mix and not mess things up, you're proving you are competent. So getting into things you see 80 minute mixes and assume ""I guess I need to be making 80 minute mixes""  


Aint nobody got time for that. Shorter = More engagement. Plus on competency, you can fake that through editing so like who gives a crap about any 80 minute set really, the other DJs who would know something is impressive also know it could have been accomplished through editing. The general public should be your target audience, not other DJs who only have time to listen to the insane amounts of music they're organizing themselves and probably not other people's mixes. 

Give the general public 30 minute mixes and 90 second video clips, they'll engage with that. I would argue that in a 30 minute mix I display my competency more than any 80 minute set I recorded in the past because I am making that 30 minutes as much of a bonfire as I can, whereas the 80 minutes I would have been maybe hesitant to be as aggressive"

361,Thoughts on Aslice and Support The Sound?,2,DJs,15,"I can't stop thinking about [this article I read on RA](https://ra.co/news/80412), and just want to hear other peoples' takes. It's about how a number of clubs and festivals (including Basement and Wire Festival) are launching an initiative called Support The Sound which aims to ""lessen the wage gap between DJs and producers through tracklist reporting"" with Aslice. DJs playing at clubs/events that are part of this initiative will be asked to share a percentage of their revenue with producers/artists whose tracks they played during their set, which Aslice suggests as 5% or more of the DJ's gig fee.

5% is not a ton, especially from a $100-$400+ gig, and I'm not exactly sure how they're dividing it up from there. Though it seems that there is already a system in place to get these producers royalties from performances of their tracks, and that would be through the PROs (ASCAP, BMI, PRS, etc.).

Every club pays an amount per year to the PROs for a blanket license. My understanding is that writers (the artist/""producer"" in this case) get paid out from this pot of money. I got this from the Donald Passman book ""All You Need To Know About The Music Business"":

>The \[PROs\] pay based on domestic concert performances, but it's only for the top three hundred grossing tours as reported in a magazine called *Pollstar*. The PROs distribute money based on **set lists**...which they get from either the venues or the artist's management...If you're performing in coffee houses and small venues, these aren't tracked separately, but both BMI and ASCAP have programs for you to submit your materials and get paid something.

Now it's my understanding that writers who do not meet the ""top three hundred"" criteria get paid from this blanket license pool of money, though I could very well be wrong. It would make sense that if there is already a way to submit your setlists to the PROs so they can pay out these producers, then shouldn't the focus shift to there? This would require more emerging producers to make sure they're affiliated with a PRO, but why wouldn't someone want to do that. Aslice currently charges $10 per playlist (setlist) submission, but they do pay out 85% to producers. I should note that Aslice states on their website that they're not there to replace the PROs, but to act as an additional revenue source.

It feels like through this model, producers who have already registered their songs with a PRO could be getting paid twice for the same performance, though once at the expense of the DJ. Let me just say I believe artists/writers/producers should be getting paid for performances of their works. We should be buying tracks, paying for tickets to shows, etc. This initiative almost comes across as venues passing the buck off to performers, while co-opting social justice/economic justice language to juice their audiences, especially given this quote from the RA article ""the role of music producers has been marginalised and undervalued.""

I wouldn't be surprised if a major factor in some clubs embracing this model would be because they've made a deal with Aslice, the same way a venue will partner with one primary ticketing platform for a sum of money (I've seen instances where that number is in the tens-of-thousands).

Another major question would be whether the playlist submission fee is covered by the venue (which it either won't be, or it will be deducted from the DJ's pay), and if DJ's will be getting paid more as well.

Again, it's only 5% of the DJ's earnings. Playlist submission is only $10. All-in-all, producers should be compensated, I'm not saying they shouldn't, and more music makers should educate themselves on the business. DJs should be paid fairly, and the entire responsibility of this issue is not the DJ's alone. It's entirely possible that this creates a situation that frames this as a problem handed to the DJ's to remedy, rather than part of a larger issue.

Thoughts?"
362,(XDJ-RX3) Rekordbox Performance Mode Changed Effects Channels from A/B to 1/2 + Other Issues,0,DJs,0,"Hi everyone,

I went to use my RX3 in performance mode today and noticed the effects trigger switched from channels A/B on the knob to 1/2.

Also noticed my gains not going as high as they usually would. Normally I would have them set around 10:00 and the gain would reach the first yellow light. Now I have to crank them to 12:00 for to reach the same level.

Another issue I noticed is my sampler sounds aren't working any more. I had them mapped and they were working fine. I see them triggering in RB but there's no sound coming out. I checked the gain in RB and it's at 12:00. 

AND the recording button is greyed out and not letting me record.

I went ahead and updated to the latest version of Rekordbox 6.8.3 (from 6.8.1) and I'm having the same issue. I was just using the same setup last week with no issues and this happened today.

Anyone ever experience anything like this? Please let me know if you know of a solution.


Thanks y'all.


EDIT: I also noticed that both waveforms aren't showing up on the RX3 screen when 2 tracks are loaded. It'll load one, then when I load another it won't show up. After loading another track, the previous one that didn't show appears and the new track's waveform won't appear.

SOLUTION: I guess I messed with the settings and set RB to external mixer mode this week. I switched it to internal and it fixed itself. 


EDIT 2: Don't update to 6.8.3 if you use an XDJ-RX3 in performance mode. The issue with the waveforms not displaying together still exists. I downgraded back to 6.8.1 and it works again."

I have the decks set up on a standing desk beneath a window (normally the shades are closed). The left CDJ and the speaker are plugged directly into outlet 1 and the DJM and the right CDJ are plugged into outlet 2. On outlet 2, I have one of those adapters that turns it into a 2-socket to a 6-socket setup. Plugged into that, I have a power strip. So in total, pulling from outlet 2, I have one DJM, one CDJ, the standing desk, the ethernet splitter, and a lamp. I am guessing that there's something about this general setup that's causing this behavior where the equipment randomly turns off in the middle of use but even the CDJ plugged directly into outlet 1 turned off. It's happened twice in the month of use and only after 1-2 hours of play. Any advice for what I can get to improve this setup? Unsure if I need something that regulates voltage, protects against surges, etc. Thanks!"

I have the chance to buy one of these bad boys in the US and save about $1500 doing so compared to back here. We use 230-240v down here and just sussing out if these mixers can be converted instead of using an external converter. 

Surely they are all made the same in the factory a d it's only a setting/power cable that is changed for each market.

Seeking wisdom from others that have or will know if this is possible.

* Maintain Loops
* Maintain Playlists in Apple Music - How I store/develop my sets

   * Not opposed to manual work here, but are there options to automate selections to get me a head start?

391,Taking gigs that don't fit your artist brand,7,DJs,28,"Hey all. I'm an artist that makes dance music and recently started DJing as a way to get in front of people. I'd say I have a decently strong artist brand at this point; lots of press, a good sized following on IG and Spotify. I'm working on getting more of the kind of gigs I really want (clubs, festivals, special events etc), where I can play my original music and play in my style.

While I'm getting some of these kinds of gigs, in the process of pitching myself, I'm getting solicited by venues that are looking for more open format/top 40 music. These gigs pay well but I don't think they really fit my ""brand."" It's like they're only half reading my pitch materials- they see my follower count and see the word ""DJ"" and want to book me, but essentially just want popular music/their requests.

FWIW I have absolutely no problem with these gigs. I think they're fun, I certainly don't mind getting paid, and at the end of the day I still see it as good experience. Some of these bars have good name recognition and sound impressive, even if they aren't really interested in ""my"" music. However, I worry that taking too many of these gigs will muddy my brand. 

I sort of feel like I'm in the place where I can't say no to gigs because I need to build my experience and credibility. But I also don't know if playing these kinds of gigs helps me land the gigs I actually want. I guess I can always play under an alias, but I suspect that the reason I am getting booked at all is for the ""clout"" around my artist project. 

Anyway, I'm interested to hear how you guys are balancing this sort of thing as I'm sure it's not uncommon. Also, I'd love more advice on how to get more of the ""on brand"" types of gigs. Thanks! "
392,Frustrated or Over It,0,DJs,31," 

Looking for some advice. Before I turned 18, I was very passionate about music. I was in a band. Started getting into music production. Pretty much was a fuckin geek of all the technicality. Started to DJ after college. A few years later everything pretty much went downhill. Started to lose interest. I was a perfectionist in everything. I never really enjoyed the process. Felt lazy doing stuff. Life and other personal stuff affected my motivation. I‚Äôve continued to DJ and make music but I am never consistent and persistent in my supposed ‚Äúhobbies‚Äù. People say I‚Äôm good but I just don‚Äôt feel like putting the work. I hesitate to enjoy it. This is something I really don‚Äôt want to lose interest in my life. Sometime I feel I didn't put in the effort as much since I missed out on opportunities. All my life has been music, and I want to accomplish something for myself even if I don‚Äôt share it.  I rarely DJ or do music anymore. 

Am I frustrated or just over this musician phase? "

410,The one thing they don't tell you about being a professional DJ...,242,DJs,43,"In my 10 years as a touring DJ, I've noticed the importance of good mental health is always overlooked, especially by aspiring DJs trying to make their dreams a reality.

Professional DJing is not a career for the mentally weak. Every touring artist, across all genres of music and art forms, will at some point struggle with their mental health. It's the nature of the job. The combination of easy access to substances, long and late hours, irregular sleep schedules, pressure to sell tickets, social media presence/comparisons, and the need to constantly produce great art for fans, all while paying the bills, will create a ticking time bomb that will explode if not managed meticulously. I battle with this balancing act regularly, so I wanted to provide my top tips for all of you out there:

1. Self-care Is Non-Negotiable: You will burn out if you can't care for yourself. Whether meditation, exercise, healthy eating, or simply taking time for yourself, ensure you're nurturing your physical and emotional well-being amidst the hectic touring schedule.

2. Establish Boundaries: The word ""No"" is your friend and essential in carving out moments for rest. This could mean turning down a gig or the third afterparty of the weekend.

3. Stay Connected: Touring is isolating, so stay connected with loved ones and fellow DJs. Maintain relationships the best you can. Surrounding yourself with a supportive network can provide much-needed comfort and encouragement.

4. Practice Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness practices into your daily routine. Whether meditation, breathing exercises, or appreciating your surroundings, mindfulness can help reduce stress amidst the chaos of touring.

5. Seek Professional Support: Don't hesitate to seek professional support if you struggle. Touring can take a toll on mental well-being, and having a therapist or counselor to talk to goes a long way. Many therapists offer virtual sessions, making it easier to access support while on the road.

6. Stay Balanced: Take breaks from the nightlife scene when possible, engage in activities that bring you joy outside of DJing, and remember to prioritize your overall well-being above all else. Sometimes partying all night is exactly what you need to blow off steam. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY!

Don't get me wrong, I love being able to DJ for a living. It was my dream, and it still is. I just thought I'd shine a light on the other side of the industry that isn't talked about as much.  "

This environment, my passion for electronic music and my dead end job were the 3 core reasons i started DJ‚Äôing. I had a lot of friends that shared my passion. My friends always enjoyed my selections and becoming a DJ felt like a career path that was meant for me. 

Then the pandemic happened. Not going in to too much detail here , but eventually those raver friend circles died out. I became depressed and i started working on myself.

I stopped working dead end jobs and decided to go to college and get a degree in CS. Fast forward to today and i have my degree and i have a job where i feel good and earning good money. I am very thankful for that.

Part of me misses playing tracks, but i also don‚Äôt have that hunger anymore. Anytime i get the opportunity to play i reject the opportunity or go in on it but don‚Äôt really want it anymore. I feel like there are a lot more passionate DJ‚Äôs out there and it is just too difficult to break through without putting in the work (obviously). It feels like i need to make a choice. Keep working my stable job, or quit and go hard DJ‚Äôing. But i‚Äôm just doing really good at my job, and it kinda sucks because that is also the reason why i‚Äôm losing my hunger to become successful as a DJ.

420,Allen & Heath Xone:96 + Eventide H90 | Info and Appreciation Post,10,DJs,7,"After long consideration and research I decided for an Eventide H90 to replace both my Boss DD-7 and Boss RV-6 effect pedals to augment my Xone 96 mostly used for DJing electronic music. It was recommended from time to time, alongside alternatives like the Boss GT-1000 and the Line 6 Helix, but I did not find explicit information to which capacity it could work with the mixer. I had hopes that I could use it in dual stereo mode as both a send-return device (like the previous pedals) and a master insert (like the RMX-1000) and not only is that indeed possible, it goes even further than that.

How I set it up:

* connect H90 1/2 in to Xone 96 SND A, H90 1/2 out to Xone 96 RTN A - ensure output is set to Line level, not Hi-Z one Xone 96 and to Line level on H90 as well
* connect H90 3/4 in to Xone 96 MASTER INSERT SND, H90 3/4 out to Xone 96 MASTER INSERT RTN
* [enable dual routing in H90](https://cdn.eventideaudio.com/manuals/h90/1.7.1/content/edit-modes/routing.html#dual-routing) and choose an appropriate routing path for the effects setup
   * Pre/Post allows for using effect A for the SND/RTN chain, effect B in the master insert
   * Presets A & B in Series/Parallel on Path 1 allows for using both effects (independently) on SND/RTN
   * Presets A & B in Series/Parallel on Path 2 allows for using both effects (independently) on master insert

This works absolutely flawlessly and the resulting sound is incredible, leagues above what I was used to with the previous pedals and absolutely no degradation in the beautifully warm Xone 96 sound quality.

What I was not aware about before is that routing can be adjusted on-the-fly. Thus, two effects can be used on SND/RTN for one track, one for SND/RTN and one for the master insert during a transition and both on master insert when crafting complex compositions of multiple tracks.

Only downside I currently see for DJ use is that there only is one global tempo setting (like on the RMX-1000) and it only supports full bpm steps, no fractional steps. As far as I'm aware, the built-in MIDI clock of the H90 cannot be fed with the Xone 96's MIDI outputs, but setting it manually is surprisingly easy using the rotary knobs compared to the tap-based bpm control I was used to on the pedals, though that is available as an option as well.

It could also be used to feed both A and B SND/RTN chains, but that would lead to the loss of the master insert functionality. As effects can be customized on-the-fly on the H90 anyway, I did not see any benefit in this. The H90 Control app is surprisingly easy to use, but the pedal has so insanely many customization options that there's probably no ever being 'done' setting it up."

I've just updated to Serato 3 to pay around with stems as they seem really useful for my sets. 

So far I am loving the feature however I've noticed that sometimes the overall sound is very patchy once I start isolating vocals from one deck and drums from another. It's mostly fine if I only remove one type of sound but the more I do the worse it the quality sounds.

I checked the Roland site and the latest firmware update was 2018.

433,Plattah,0,DJs,28,"
Has anyone heard of this term for DJ‚Äôn?
It‚Äôs got something to do with BPM sign language? Like the Nashville number system for DJ‚Äôs? I saw a couple of dudes DJn together at a rave in Vegas in 2019 and they were using some kind of sign language for changes. I‚Äôm a DJ and I‚Äôve been DJn for about 5 years but I‚Äôve never seen anything like it before. And I asked a couple of people who didn‚Äôt know either but this one older cat said he thought it was called ‚ÄúPlattah!‚Äù I asked him ‚ÄúPlatter?‚Äù And he said no, that it had an ‚ÄúH‚Äù at the end. I spent a couple of years checking the internet and asking around, especially DJ‚Äôs, but nothing came up. I began to think that it was just some bs that dude was telling me. But then I went to Mardi Gras in 2022 and one night I ended up watching these 2 DJ‚Äôs who were playing together and they seemed to be using the same technique. I think it was a guy and girl but they were dressed up in costumes (if you‚Äôve ever been to Mardi Gras, you know what I‚Äôm talking about!) I got a chance to talk to them after their set and they affirmed that they were using ‚ÄúPlattah‚Äù and I was right about it being like the Nashville Number System for DJ‚Äôs! They showed me how it worked but I was so fucked up, I can‚Äôt even remember their DJ names‚Ä¶ But I remember it was mostly fingers on one hand kinda like a baseball catcher calling a play or something and all I really remember is that it somehow covered BPM‚Äôs, the Key of the track, changes or transitions, AND genres somehow because these cats were playing all kinds of shit! 
Well, now me and a friend are DJn together and he‚Äôs been a hip hop DJ for years now and I‚Äôve been primarily EDM since I started but recently we‚Äôve both been branching out and even delving into old funk and disco. We like mashups and we like each other‚Äôs style and stuff and hanging out going to shows and recently decided to join forces and DJ together but we both freestyle our sets so naturally we want to freestyle DJn together! We tried Abelton Link but we both agreed it just didn‚Äôt sound right or vibe well and while practicing we can just kinda tell each other BPM‚Äôs or changes but in a louder environment, that shit don‚Äôt fly! 
So my question is, does anyone know about the PLATTAH method and can tell me how to do it or point me in the direction of where to get some kind of instructions for it? Like I said it‚Äôs definitely a thing but obviously it‚Äôs not widespread knowledge."

440,"How would you interpret ""Uk vibe"" ",34,DJs,61,"So basically this promoter asked me to have a more ""Uk sound"" for a special event someone is throwing this friday at a (EDM) club.

Im in Canada and promoter doesn't know wtf does that mean, we're trying to reach the person throwing the party but i wanna start digging for tracks right away.

So far I was thinking : Garage, dnb, breakbeats, euro 4/4 (130-145bpm). Maybe a some techno in there and a LOT of drill acapellas and or recognizable vocals ala flowdan.

Any ideas to interpret ""Uk vibes""?


:UPDATE: Alright, well, thanks for an absolutely MASSIVE amount of very good recommendations!

 but unfortunately, it seems like the host saw Fred again and Chase & status's Boiler room, and that's his UK vibe. So, nothing too ""deep"", and promoters want to keep it appealing to a larger crowd

So what i'll be going for is ""sub genre mainstream"" as i 
like to call it. So Basically, play very popular tracks they probably heard from sub genres they mostly barely know. To make them feel like they're experiencing ""underground"" music even tho it's garage or dnb anthems. Also throw in some night bass since they'll most likely know this as well.

 I'll be digging in your recommendations, so far found some good stuff. And some really neat stuff for my fun lil' personal collection.

I have trouble talking to people. Back in school I was doing the same things as everybody else. Communicating was easy because people could identify with any problems you might have

But now since I became a full time DJ it is harder to talk and communicate to people. They don't know what I mean or go through.


- When you are off, everybody else is working
- When you are working, everybody else is sleeping
- People have a hard time understanding how difficult it is to be a freelancer and not always having certainty of income like you have with a 9 to 5 job.
- Everybody thinks you do nothing but partying which is of course not true. I was almost denied renting a room because of this.
- Stress when you do a DJ gig. Sometimes it feels like it's you vs everybody else in the club 

Just wondering if you experience things like this?"
451,Recommendations for sorting (rekordbox) library,0,DJs,5,"How do you guys sort your libraries. I have 3 big tabs with techno, house, disco, and hits, but there are too many subgenres. Some playlists have 10 songs and others have 200 which makes it very difficult to have a good overview. One big problem is that whenever I want to add a new playlist, I then have to go through all my songs to see if they fit the playlist which takes too much time with 3100 songs. I also have playlists for specific sets I play which is usually what I resort back to when I am looking for songs to play at another set but this results in me playing a lot of the same songs and missing out on bangers that I have forgotten about.

Did anyone else have and solve this problem for themselves? There is probably not one universal best library layout as everyone plays differently but some tips would be very useful! I do not want to spend 20 hours sorting everything again, only to realise halfway that I regret the chosen layout.

Thanks in advance!

I just gave up trying to listen to two very famous DJs because they cant seem help themselves from interrupting the flow of their amazing sets with their own interjections.

After watching some youtube tutorials i set up the tascam based on the videos' instruction. Im pretty firm that i follow all the instruction and set up the record mode and everything correctly on the tascam. 

However the tascam is recording external audio and background noise, it doesn't record the internal soundcard output. 

I tried to connect the tascam to record out and then the booth out output on the mixer, every time it still record background noise and external audio again.  

I use the cable TRS to same dual 1/4 to connect the tascam to booth out output
I used the TRS jack to Dual RCA to connect the tascam to record out output  

I think i used the WRONG cables so the tascam keeps recording background noise and external audio? 

I do some research, and i think should i plug tbe RCA male to XLR male cable or 1/4 TS to Dual RCA cable into record out output on the mixer (pics of those 2 cable included)  then this will work correctly for the Tascam to record internal soundcard output and no more background noise, external audio?

469,Tidal Pricing Updated for DJs,5,DJs,26,"Exciting news for Audiophiles is that Tidal HiFi will now drop to the same price as Tidal's base subscription for an individual plan of $11/month as of April 10, 2024. Not so great for those who use Tidal with software such as Serato, VirtualDJ, or Algoriddum djay Pro is that Tidal will add $9 monthly to the base subscription.  As per the digital trends article, ""*For those who want to be able to access the Tidal library via* [*software- and hardware-based DJ tools*](https://tidal.com/djs)*, an add-on fee of $9 per month will be needed.*""

Over the past couple of months, Serato and djay Pro removed the ability to use Stems; separate tracks for voice, drums, and rhythm with Tidal's streaming music because they say it falls within a different licensing/copyright tier. Could this additional $9 per month bring back the ability to use Stems with Tidal? Or is this just a new DJ tax for the privilege to connect Tidal streaming?  


Apple Music recently became available on djay Pro without increasing its subscription cost. My take is that Tidal is going to use the additional $9 from DJs to bring back Stems which would be pretty awesome. What do you think?

475,My first close to trainwreck gig,59,DJs,57,"Last night was a near trainwreck of a gig, just barely pulled it back from the gutter the last two hours. Was booked for a surprise birthday, where the hubby wanted danceable 90‚Äôs music and I prepared a few different genre crates since 90‚Äôs is one hell of a broad of a term. 3 hours in and not a single one of the genres drew more than 2-3 people to the floor, and the requests for 80‚Äôs, top 10, grunge, eurodisco, underground hip-hop, trance etc. were piling up. When the planner came over with his phone and a top 1000 Songs from 1970-2020 ready on his Spotify I nearly just packed up and left, I felt like a total failure at this point. But I straightened my neck and started freestyling all the sing-along, top songs from every era and genre I could think of and miraculously made the night end on a highnote with nearly all on the floor dancing and singing their brains out. But, the first few hours still haunt me, I felt so utterly useless and ill prepared. Time to dig into the crates and make a ton of 3-5 songs mini-crates of every genre known to man and be sure to get a bit more info from the planner upfront. I won‚Äôt let that happen again (but I‚Äôm a grown man, I know it will üòÖ)."

Some of these might not even be active anymore, and many releases are old from 2000s and what not.

I wanted to avoid having to use an external soundcard, and the official instructions on the Pioneer website which involved using Soundflower, Jack and creating aggregate devices etc seemed unnecessarily complicated - after all Ableton is able to see multiple inputs from the S7, with channels 5/6 being the REC out, so why can't OBS?   


So, I hopped on the OBS discord channel, and asked that very question, and as fate would have it a helpful chap called PatTheMav replied:

498,Any advice on how to stay positive when DJing,0,DJs,59,"I started DJing last year August. Since then I have made significant improvements, booked myself a lot of different gigs, and now I am gaining more recognition in the DJ scene. Even so, I still consider myself a beginner since I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm at a point I can confidently say I can mix most song‚Äôs perfectly (or at a good enough standard compared to others)

Although I like to believe I am good at DJing and people have told me I am, I still can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm shit at it. The more I practice and try to improve my skills, the more I feel like I‚Äôm failing and I just get really upset. Like way more upset than I should get, it can ruin my week sometimes.

Does anyone else feel like this or am I being dramatic? I‚Äôm trying to tell myself to just have fun and enjoy the process and I will learn/improve on the way, I did only start a few months ago I don‚Äôt need to be perfect right now. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like I should be so much better at this by now. 

Idk, I sound like I‚Äôm fighting myself in this post lol. I just would really like advice. I want this negative feeling/thoughts to calm down. It does motivate me to want to improve but it feels really shitty, I start to doubt myself and abilities a lot which makes me reluctant to practice or want to book gigs. I‚Äôm taking a 2 month break from gigs to focus on improving and doing mini projects but any advice is welcomed.

So, looking for a replacement. I've for a long time now eyed the DragonFly Reds(i hear Cobalt isn't as warm, so i feel like i should pass over that)- but, i understand the dragonfly lineup is a tad overpriced even though i don't mind getting another and the Black never had issues for me at all.

Any recs? I DJ using Mixxx ,mainly FLACS- I always hardwire in and don't use Bluetooth for DJ'ing at places.(Mentioning this because I see a lot of stuff on Qudelix and Bluetooth oddly)

511,Mods: add DJ ID flare?,3,DJs,11,"Question to the people with the attention of the mods. One thing I‚Äôve notice as I‚Äôve been on this forum is that there are many types of dj here. This gives us a great range of perspective but it also causes some tension and conflicting advice. For example when asking about reading a crowd, one will advise to check your ego and play what makes the crowd happy, while the next will say fuck the crowd play what you feel. Or on the recent festival post some people advised to preplan your set while I find that blasphemous. A lot of these opinions depend on what kind of dj you are. If you‚Äôre a wedding/open format dj maybe it makes sense to go with the crowd, if your playing a mainstream festival, maybe a preplaned set is better, while for underground djs it makes more sense to showcase your abilities as a selector and play a set that‚Äôs spontaneous.

I think it would be helpful to know what type of dj is asking questions and what type of dj is giving advice. In the sports sub reddits, there‚Äôs a flare next to your username for team/player affiliation. I think it would be useful for us to identify our background so our perspectives are contextualized. Maybe some tags could be by genre/style ‚ÄúHouse‚Äù, ‚ÄúOpen Format‚Äù, ‚ÄúHip Hop‚Äù, or by event type ‚Äúwedding‚Äù, ‚Äúunderground club‚Äù, ‚Äúbedroom dj‚Äù, etc

513,What application do you use on your computer to catalog and manage your music library and playlists? iTunes/Music app breaks playlists after OS updates/restoring from backups,5,DJs,55,"**TLDR:** What application do you use on your computer to catalog and manage your music library and playlists? How do you back it up?

FWIW I'm on a Mac but I am open to switching to Windows. I honestly prefer Windows but heard that Macs are better for DJing which is why I have been using them.

So, I used to use iTunes (which is now the Music app) to catalog/manage all my music and playlists. A lot of these playlists were smart playlists (to show songs by genre, or by decade, or to only show clean edits or remixes, etc.) but some were also ""top hits during the summer of 20xx"" type playlists.

Then I would just open up Serato or Djay or whatever and it would seamlessly integrate with my iTunes library and all my playlists would be there for me to perform with.

This worked great for a while; however, every few years if I upgrade my operating system (or the computer itself) the music library will often just obliterate itself and I'll get some stupid error.  I still have all the mp3's safely on my computer, but all my playlists get hosed. Because I use a Mac, I can't just easily (if at all?) downgrade the operating system or the version of the iTunes/Music app, at least not without erasing my entire computer which is a massive inconvenience.

Yes, I back up my library. But it seems that the way the iTunes/Music app imports/exports your past library database file changes every couple years and the support from Apple around this issue isn't very helpful so I'm stuck rebuilding all of my playlists again.

I'm sick of this happening...what do I do?

a) Buy a dedicated laptop just for DJing and never connect it to the internet/don't update it? But then, if that computer ever breaks down I may run into the same issue, right? Plus what if I need/want to buy an new controller, and then that controller requires a newer OS...then I have to update again and I may face this issue again.

b) Take screenshots of all my playlists every so often so I can remember what they were and remake them? This seems super lame but I guess it could work although it would be a massive time suck.

c) Use a better music organization program? This is what I am leaning toward but I would prefer to not lock myself into something like Rekordbox, in case I want to switch to a different brand of controller later on. Does anyone have any recommendations?   
c) Any other suggestions or tips?"

The drive is formatted in FAT-32 as it should be and when uploading my music from Rekordbox to the drive it is doing so with no issues. When I look at the drive on my laptop all the music files are there and playable.   


I have the latest version of software on the CDJ and also Rekordbox, and the USB is brand new and recommended to use with the CDJ - SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD.  


I used SanDisk Ultra Luxe prior to these USBs and they were writing fine but then crashing when plugged in (going on emergency loop) and then all the content data was wiped (artist, playlist, album etc) and I was just left with a single contents folder with all my music in there. 

I'm not sure if the issue is with Rekordbox or the CDJs, but it would be strange for both decks to have the same issue which makes me think its Rekordbox or how my Mac is writing to the drives.

517,Any way to bypass the internal soundcard on the Rane Seventy Two MKII?,1,DJs,9,"I hope this isn't the wrong sub for this kinda question. If it is, please feel free to remove the post.

I recently bought a Seventy Two MKII and was baffled to see, after checking the spectrals in Audacity, that it only outputs 48khz. After asking Rane support about this they told me that the Seventy Two has an internal soundcard which only outputs 48khz.

518,Advice for playing at a music festival for the first time?,4,DJs,11,"I'm going to be playing at smaller music festival (around 3000 people) in my home country and it'll be my first time playing on a big stage separated from the crowd.

All the club shows I've done, I've been on a slightly elevated platform but close enough to lock eyes with individuals and high five people.  I feed off the energy from people's reactions and it informs my set, allowing me to build highs and lows and get in tune with what's working and what isn't.

**What advice do you have on playing to a crowd on a stage that big?**  

I'll be going on at 9:15 to 10:30, the festival ends at 2AM.  I have the perfect time slot to build the crowd up and get them pumped for the last 3 artists.  I don't want to plan my set before hand too much because I'm not a headliner so I can't trust that everything I want to do will work. 

Right now the gameplan is assume the majority of the crowd is still coming in, use the first 15 minutes to play popular songs / edits that invite people to the dance floor, ramp up to 3 or 4 different bangers, then taper off for the last 10 minutes to cool the crowd done for the next artist."

521,DJ/live sound guy ,3,DJs,8,"I DJ at a 200-300? capacity venue atleast a few weekend nights a month which also have live bands either Friday or Saturday nights, sometimes both. How the scheduling goes is the DJ plays a warm up set for the first hour then the band plays, DJ plays during their set breaks and the last hour of the night. Lately the venue is pushing the idea of whoever the DJ is should be handling the live sound for the band from sound check to finish. Currently, they are paying someone next to nothing to get by but are looking to let them go soon. Some bands bring their own sound guys. The rotation of djs have very little live sound experience and aren‚Äôt there often enough for training to really stick in my opinion. For the djs, we are getting paid the normal market rate to play for a few hours in between the bands. Venue has a nice pa and lighting system.

My thoughts on this:

#1 DJ‚Äôs are not live sound techs. Obviously there are live sound techs that DJ on the side and vice versa.

#2 I believe the venue should either hire a dedicated sound guy or require all bands to bring their own. Given the amount of money this place makes I can‚Äôt see this going over budget. Having any band come through and sound great every time as oppose to having a DJ struggle through a rushed sound check and trying to troubleshoot things like feedback, mic placement, changes in crowd density that can effect the mix throughout the night. Customers do and will take notice.

Recently I‚Äôve been thinking to get back into dj‚Äôing and was thinking would it be good to have 2 different ‚Äúidentities‚Äù online. One as a normal office salary man and another one as DJ.

Just curious on how you guys strike a balance between your professional and hobbyist life on social media, if you work in a corporate environment. Do you have 2 IG accounts or just one single Instagram account? Any tips or strategies you find effective in maintaining a distinct online presence for work and personal interests?"

528,Issues with Rane One pitch randomly speeding up and down,1,DJs,6,"I'm running Virtual DJ Pro on a Surface Book 2 and playing on a Rane One. I've noticed that it randomly speeds up or down a song and even distorts the audio as and I'm not sure what's going on as I haven't changed the settings I've been using it with over the last year. Since I can't post a video, the best way to describe it is that the wave form speeds up then slows down, the audio sounds like you're listening to someone singing under water. The issue also affects both decks randomly.

I also tried using serato and had the same problem.

Is that real DJing? Is real DJing a thing? What's the difference between this and that? I see this stuff on twitch and youtube and it just looks so... performative and egotistical.

I have played on the DDJ 1000 (upgraded to FLX10) so I am very familiar with how to DJ, beatmatch, transition etc...but how hard is it to go from a controller to this setup? I feel fairly confident, but would like some feedback..

Edit: I did find out Phase DJ is being used, as well as DVS. That takes away some of my worry I guess, as I don't have to actually worry about needles and tone arms.  I appreciate all the feedback üôè, and if there is anymore,  I'd love to hear based on new info.  "

547,"lol, my dream set up is stressing me out. ",0,DJs,15,"Okay guys so sorry for the long kind of rant post I think my ADHD is just getting the best of me. 

Allow me to go ahead and spit it all out here, so long story short; I‚Äôm a DJ who is also the producer DJ in a dance pop duo and we‚Äôre based in both Tokyo, Japan  and Christchurch, New Zealand which is why we‚Äôre not actively playing shows ATM. However, I think any DJ will relate to that you moment when you have a new project to work on and you start daydreaming about your dream set up.

Recently, I‚Äôve been going back-and-forth as well as making some progress on my set up. 

I‚Äôm definitely someone who would consider themselves a producer / dj as opposed to dj / producer and I would also consider myself a controllerist by nature. (My first foray into dj-ing was ‚Äúscratching‚Äù and playing samples over nu metal songs with the dm2 mixman  my parents bought me for Christmas back in the early 2000‚Äôs -_-0) 

I mention all this to paint a picture of my dj-ing style. I love using the gear in a ‚Äúband dj‚Äù kinda way. I‚Äôve dj-ed in several bands and also bring my S4 to club events so I can maintain my playing style. 

Anyways, as I mentioned before I‚Äôm starting to day dream about my dream set up for my new dance pop duo as we are finishing up our debut EP and my wife is ‚Äúallowing‚Äùme to splurge on gear. 

The goal would be to have a four channel set up so that I can use three tracks per song (live version of the song, a hot cue scratch track, along with a scratch track for scratching) and then have an extra track to use as an interlude in between songs. 

I also love kinetic energy, via motorised platters, but I don‚Äôt necessarily need four of them. 

I would love any input on which set up idea you think would suit my needs best. 

Tracktor Kontrol S4 mk3 with two Rane 12 mk2s (Along with a 13 inch MacBook Air with an external monitor, I have poor eyesight )

Or 

Denon Prime 4+ with two SC6000m primes 

I‚Äôve already bought the S4 and the MacBook Air, for another project of mine, and bc I needed a laptop. But I wouldn‚Äôt mind taking my time to invest in a set up that would bring out my creativity in a live setting. 

I also plan to use this set up for writing music for this specific project as I want to be able to create with the tools that I will use to play the songs back.

I originally wanted the two Rane 12s but I don‚Äôt like the fact that the hot cues are placed at the top of the unit and I feel that that might kind of take me out of my flow when it comes to playing hot cue parts and  scratching. 

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. "

Previously living in small town NZ the only night spot (I won't call it a ""club"") that played dance music in any form was just a guy cross fading tunes on non-cdj CD players, no actual mixing... And according to the bumblefuck locals, ""don't go there, it's a gay bar!"" üôÑ

Weekend I moved back to Wellington the Spastik man was in town... Full decks, efx and 909 in action. Life changed hard that night. Rocked up at 11pm, left in a haze at 5am, completely sober the whole night.

552,S4 MK3 to F1/ X1 with Pioneer mixer sanity check,2,DJs,8,"Hey,

My current setup is 2 xdj700s (not running HID) running into channels 3/4 of an S4 MK3, with the S4Mk3 running the supreme screen hack, with the intention of using decks A/B for stems/ remix decks.

I'm also using beat link trigger software to sync traktor as a slave to the XDJ700s via ableton link.

Due to the supreme screen hack being broken for stems/ remix decks on the s4mk3 & usage of ableton link to sync up those 2 decks with the XDJs, it defeats the point of having the s4mk3/ jogwheels on that channel, I'm also looking to get more comfortable with pioneer mixers effects units for when playing out, and having a setup that's easier for friends to plug and play with, so the switch seems to make sense

The intention is to sell the s4mk3 & purchase a pioneer mixer (750mk2/ 850/ 900nxs), all of which appear to have USB soundcards, meaning I can run Traktor in 2deck external mixer mode, sending the 2 traktor decks to 2 decks on the pioneer mixer via USB, and having the 2 XDJs running into the other 2 channels 

In order to control those 2 decks within traktor (2 stem decks or 1 stem deck + 1 remix deck), I'm unsure if a single F1 would be enough, or if i'll want an F1 + X1 or 2 F1s

Ideally i'm looking to still use the internal traktor FX on individual stems channels too, but I could possibly just map an LPD8 if needed

Any thoughts on the setup would be greatly appreciated :)"

I would like to check with you if moving to a Xone 92 would make a big difference in sound quality/mix pleasure?

Or would perhaps adding some modern external phono preamps (genre ART DJ Pre II) to the Empath even get me a better sound VS the Xone?

I only need two channels though. The Xone's 4 band EQ looks to be a nice improvement to sculpt the mixing more, together with the filters and LFO.

Maybe there are other mixers to consider.
Had couple of years ago a Super Stereo DN78 rotary, but found it impractical, no panning, radio interference, imprecise, muddy. I like long mixes, but also fast cutting. So a rotary doesn't look to suit me well.

Please leave me your ideas, so I can move on in my mixing/sound journey. Thanks üôè

560,had my first gig yesterday - feeling horrible,91,DJs,162,"Hey all, I had my first gig yesterday at a nightclub as the headliner. I planned out a set for 2 hours, and I showed up to the venue early to make sure everything was working (which it was). During my set however, I learned that the play button and a bunch of the hotcue buttons on the controller (XDJ-XZ) weren't working properly. This led to me fucking up transitions a couple transitions during my set (that I've been able to do smoothly practicing many times), and getting some weird looks from the crowd for a few seconds.

My friends after told me that I did well and that they didn't notice anything, but I can't help but feel like they're just saying that to help me feel better. Anyone have any advice for overcoming this feeling? I was really excited for the gig and now that it's over I honestly can't even bring myself to look at my decks. Any advice?

EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect the amount of responses this got. I definitely feel much better reading through a lot of these - I guess I was just really overthinking it. Crowd had a great time, my friends had a great time, and I'm not gonna let shitty equipment ruin a special experience for me. Thanks all!"

My budged atm isn‚Äòt that high (abt. 300 euro) and I was wondering if I could use a traktor z1 as my Mixer midi mapped in serato with the respective serato timecode vinyls.
Or should i go for the z2. (Does the z1 even work for that purpose?)

I was also looking at some reloop and numark scratch mixers but all the offers I found on ebay and fb marketplace exceeded my budged.

So what are your thoughts maybe you have a better Option for me that I could use, I also looked at some dvs interfaces but they are either discontinued (rane sl2) or too expensive for my current budged based on the fact i also have to buy a Mixer.

Looking forward to your aswers, cheers and thanks beorehand:)"

573,AKAI Professional APC Mini MK2 vs SoundSwitch Control One Pro & Cons?,0,DJs,2,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any input on the pros and cons of the Akai unit vs the control one. By using the Control One, you would bypass the need to have the usb dongle for one.   


I have been running the Control One for a few gigs. It works. The thing I don't like about is the touch slider and the mini screen. I don't find it useful during live gigs when I am focused on mixing primarily. I have seen a few people online using the Akai units. What I do like about that is that it has mechanical sliders which would make it easy to dim things on the fly. But I am not sure what the cons of the unit are.   


The control one works within SeratoDJ and VirtualDJ as tested. Not sure if the Akai unit needs some other sort of software running in order to work. The Soundswitch software when running performance mode has the exact button layout as the ControlOne, so its easy to make quick changes and still be able to see what your changing. I know the ControlOne also has dual usb, something I don't use.   


Wondering if anyone could also comment on speed and any input lag etc. I am assuming the Akai gets plugged into the computer usb as as well as the SoundSwitch getting plugged into another USB. The SS plug is where you connect your dmx output to. "

1. repair for 480 EUR
2. take the unit back for 105 EUR, not repaired
3. give the unit to Pioneer, free of charge

given the fact that it's a regular CDJ2000 and not a Nexus, there's no sync function and thus I can't bypass the jog wheel for mixing. which of the three options would you pick?

thanks a lot!"
578,Dirty looking Slipmats,13,DJs,16,"Stumbled across a couple of threads re cleaning slipmats. So I checked mine and was a bit shocked. Have to say I've not really taken any notice of their condition and I usually mix in lower light in the evening, but on checking they looked shite. Not sure how old they are but it's 3 years ish if I had to guess . Dust covers are on and off.

Immediately picked up some new ones (Dr Suzuki Mix Edition)."
579,Cleaning my 1210's,10,DJs,9,"I need to clean up my 1210's.  Got them new in 94 and only ever used them at home, but although I give them a dust off every now and again, they need a proper clean up. 

There are a few threads on cleaning but I want to make sure I get this right - these things mean a lot to me! What is the best thing to clean the top plate. 

Slightly unique in that the dots you see in pic 2, 3 and 4 are hash oil from many years ago. So I need to remove that and then clean up the top plate - especially to the left of the pitch where it's looking a little worn from all the use over the years.

 Sounds pathetic but these mean a lot to me so I don't want to do anything that would affect/damage the colour (says the guy who in a previous life dropped hash oil on them!).

In pic 5 I have managed to pick up a couple of marks on the base - must have been from when I moved house at some point. 

Should I just use washing up liquid, or anyone have recommendations for cleaning solutions I should use (in the UK).

Oh and yes the tonearm is lifted up in pic 1 before anyone asks!

Thanks"

581,"Pioneer DJ, AlphaTheta, and industry standards. Or... who learned on vinyl?",15,DJs,61,"I wrote this as a reply to that other post about Denon DJ now having a shot at becoming ""industry standard"". I don't know why but the post was deleted. Anyway, I'd love to hear what other DJs think of my take, especially those who've come up through the change to digital.

TL;DR - The main reason Pioneer DJ became the industry standard in the first place is because the old standard bearer (Technics) didn't offer what the changing industry wanted. Pioneer will remain in place (regardless of the brand name) until they no longer provide what the industry needs, even if competitors manage to beat them around the margins of price and features.

Original comment: 

Here's my take looking back.

I  think about the last time the ""industry standard"" changed: from  Technics 1200s to CDJs. Pioneer DJ rose during a crucial transformation  in the industry, and their product did something that the incumbent club  standard *could not do*. 1200s  can not play digital music files. CDJs didn't just do what the previous  king did, but better, or at a lower price point. They did something the  previous standard couldn't do\*

So, I wonder, and I suspect, that Pioneer DJ / Alpha Theta / Whatever will only fall off if and when they can *no longer perform the essential function* of the brand leader, which is only this: provide gear that does what the industry wants

\*I realize DVS muddies this argument to some degree, but: I'll maintain  that what Pioneer brought to the table with their players was better  suited to industry needs as the digital revolution marched on. IIRC,  Phase was only launched in 2018, so until then DVS required not only a  laptop, but needles, for chrissakes. Meanwhile the CDJ2000NXS2 was  already out. DJs wanted digital, and the difference between a NXS2 and a  1200 with control vinyl presents a stark contrast between solutions to  that problem. Much more stark than a CDJ3000, and another product that's  marginally cheaper and marginally better. Know what I'm saying?

582,Electro Swarm not responding to sound,0,DJs,2,"I work for a school district and do small dances for some of the schools. I'm definitely not a pro but several years back I bought an electric Swarm light and fog machine to add ambience. Suddenly the Swarm doesn't respond to music. If I tap the rubber grommet it kicks on but it stops even with loud music.  I took it apart and didn't see any signs of broken wires or loose connections, so I'm wondering if the epe microphone is bad or if it might be the sensitive dial.  Does anyone have any idea what I might try for  repair?"

584,How do you remember your digital tracks among hundreds of others?,27,DJs,93,"When I Dj'd back in the late 90's I knew most of the tracks by the record sleeve / label, so flicking through my record box i'd instantly know the tune I wanted to select just by the sleeve it was in or the label on the vinyl, if I had a tune in mind, I could for example quickly flick through until I saw a Perfecto sleeve, or Hooj Choons sleeve etc, knowing that it would be one of them, then finding the exact track. It was more of a visual association with the music and the sleeve.

In this CDJ/MP3 day and age how do you even start to form some sort of fimiliarity with your tracks? I'm sure DJ's have hundreds or thousands more tracks now then if they were Djing when it was predominently vinyl, yea some MP3s have little thumbnail fake sleeve images, but looking on a CDJ or laptop it's just text?, I understand you can have folders, but it's all essentially just lists to go through.

I find it easy to flick through a physical collection and think ""oh yea I try that one"", but I just don't have an association with the music by looking at track titles on a screen, even if I know the artists or title of the tune i'm looking for, anyone else have a similair problem?

Also how many tracks get lost into the ether this way, at least with physical media you have it there infront of you and it can jog a memory while flicking through, not squirreled away on hard drives or lists, never to be played again because hundreds of other tracks have superceeded it? so how do people keep a tabs on what they have, by memorising the artists & track names only?

586,Do techno/house DJs often skip quiet parts in tracks?,24,DJs,46,"Hey there,

I've noticed a lot of techno, house and deep house sets barely have any quiet moments, with DJs keeping the energy high from start to finish. Is this because many DJs choose to mix parts of tracks before hitting the big drop, avoiding the quieter sections?

Curious to know if this is a common technique to maintain the set's energy. How do you handle the dynamics in your sets? Do you skip the quieter parts, or do you play tracks more fully to include a mix of highs and lows?

Would love to hear your strategies and thoughts on this"

Not a few songs... But flat out give them entire genres of music that I worked years to get and find... I view building my catalog as one of the most important parts of being a dj because it's a showcase of ur musical knowledge, and it helps you actually LEARN your music as opposed to just playing some shit that was given to you.

Then it also causes clubbers (at least where i dj) to complain that all the DJs sound the same... So yes, I hate when I'm asked to just send someone my music... Music that I used either my prior knowledge or research to find, pay for, then normalize to a consistent audio level... I'm not an asshole about it when I'm asked... But it's shocking how many do it, and it's a bit annoying tbh because that wont grow you as a dj"

596,Been eating me up for years: was I the assshole?,22,DJs,28,"Back in 2010s I was a small time DJ that convinced a coffee house to host me weekly for a very niche themed night. Ran it well for about 2 years, a few issues with the venue over equipment and payments caused enough issue for me to have to stop the night.
I posted, letting my amazingly supportive friends know that I wouldn't be able to DJ there for that event anymore.

Here is where the issue lies: I let my ego go. I asked, if they had to keep running the event *I created* without me, if they would please just change the event name. Every bit of promotion for this event was all done by me, everything was tied to me and my Socials, you couldn't bring up this event today without it leading right to me.
 The event was Me being the DJ, so if people come expecting me after I had to quit, they would be disappointed.

I got a lot of push back and vitriol on my ask, but was eventually able to compromise and change the name. The event died anyways not long after I left, and I think it was mostly due to the venue not offering the replacement DJ half of the offer I got, and the one vitriolic pusher being a douch canoe about the event. 

Was it really disrespectful of **me** to ask the event name change because I was no longer able to run it? This is weighing on me as I want to resume my passion, but knowing the people that pushed back, they'll drag this up and start the rumor mill against me if I don't step up and address this first.

597,What method do you use to find similar songs?,1,DJs,32,"I have a few tracks that I feel are absolute bangers and everytime I've played them, the audience loved them. But they are quite unique songs and I always struggle to find similar songs to play after them. How would you overcome this ?"
598,Is playing out full songs alone acceptable?,15,DJs,79,"Hello, I am a rave DJ  (happy hardcore, gabber, jungle, breakcore, super intense stuff like that is my speciality) I wonder what you guys think of constantly mixing two (or more for 4 channel spinners) songs together at once to make a personalized version of your music and like actually be creating a new thing vs just playing majority to a full song out? like theres many tracks I have that are compelling  enough alone to just play as a full track, but I also feel anxious when I do that because Im not really adding anything new and I get anxious that my audience can tell because its hard to appear busy when im just playing a song?

Curious on what everyone's take is on this. Obviously there are situations where playing full songs are more than acceptable (playing for events, galleries, weddings, parties) where your music is second to the event, but in a situation where you are the main focus as a performer I feel awkward/anxious just playing a song and standing around. is this something I should just not worry about or what?

604,XDJ-RX2 fader cap repair question,3,DJs,2,"Looking for an RX2 expert to help me work out if I'm being ripped off (intentaionally or otherwise). Took my RX2 in for repair because a CUE button was broken, and mentioned that the fader caps on the two channel faders keep popping off and would it be easy to fix them. A couple of hours later I get an email saying the repair is done with an invoice including two full fader assembly replacements. I called up to query this; they were very apologetic that an internal miscommunication had led to the repair being carried out without my approval, but they were adamant that the full fader assembly had to be replaced. My question is, could this be the case given the faders functioned fine, just the caps kept flying off? I know they use P-lock to attach, so the only way I can see this being the case is if the metal stem of the fader had worn down to the extent that the P-lock could no longer attach. Is this possible/likely?

Frankly if they'd told me this was necessary before carrying out the repair I might have just opted to superglue the fader caps back on rather than pay ¬£35 a piece for new faders. I don't plan to gripe about it though as long as I know there wasn't a cheaper way to repair them properly. Thanks in advance for any input!"
605,Dj Booth - ideas for adjustable width?,0,DJs,5,"I'm in the middle of a reno and looking for ideas for a DJ booth that should be around 4ft wide for my own gear, but adjustable to make it wider when friend comes over with his gear on occasion and we play 4 decks with 2 mixers. I'll have less space after the reno is done, so that's why I'm looking for an adjustable booth that can be out of the way and as small as possible when not in use, but very quick and easy to expand out when the moment arises.

I use a Xone 96 and CDJ 2000's w/ MasterSounds FX + isolator and he uses a Rane MP2016 and XDJ1000's, so we probably need 84"" of total width when he comes over.

He's an inch or two shorter than me, so the side he DJ's on can be a bit shorter if needed, which would help it tuck into my side when it's not needed.

I was thinking about either a 'swivel' design or a 'booth in a booth / nesting table' design. Pics below for some context. Either way, any design would need to be strong enough to support the gear and must have heavy duty castor wheels to allow them to move around.

I figure there must be some pretty interesting ideas for working in smaller spaces.

Any suggestions for booth designs you have seen that could work?

Thanks very much!

609,Quixk-mixing & full Songs reasonings?,7,DJs,13,"Personally I think a good song doesn't need my help outside of putting it on and picking the next song so I like the full songs without effects or added beats.  But I am fascinated by quick-mixing because it seems so antithetical to what I grew up with going to clubs.  The first time I heard it done was so upsetting to me as a music fan because some of the best parts are at the end, especially if somebody like Patti was on vocal duties.

I am very curious about quick-mixing (especially hip-hop) vs full songs, beyond personal preference.  Do audiences prefer it or did DJs just start doing it (to look busy or something) and people expect it so DJs do it because people expect it because....

Are the songs (in general) these days just not good enough to play it all out?  But I hear people quick mix classics too and it feels so odd to me.   They used to play out a song like Taana Gardner's Heartbeat or Lil Louis French Kiss til the end but not anymore it seems.

What is the theory behind quick-mixing that has made it so prevalent? 

On the flip side is playing full songs of say deep house or trance. For example La Tour Hypnomaia is a track that has high and lows and slow parts and other weird sheet going on.  But a lot of stuff people say the play entire tracks of I sounds like burning man music and just stays in one place for ten minutes with no real journey.  Even Icy Lake by Dat Oven seemed to go somewhere even if it was pretty repetitive.

613,Mixer choice...I keep going back and forth!,2,DJs,37,"Hey, I'm struggling with a new mixer choice, I'm after some help from you lot, mainly in terms of what you have experienced and what is important to you.



Background - I'm in the UK. I have my trusty 1200's which are nearly 30 years old, 2 x XDJ1000mk2's, a CDJ1000mk3, Circuit Tracks, EFX-500.

* In the mid 90's: Just 2 channel Synergy crap mixer
* Late 90's DJM-300
* This decade: DJM-450
* Then a DJM750mk2
* Dabbled with an Ecler WARM2

The 1st WARM2 didn't play nicely with my Korg mini effects unit, the 2nd WARM2 popped and broke, as such I have no faith in another one.

The 750mk2 is capable, but it doesn't sound amazing. Also the effects are.....well, junk. I like the echo, and that's probably the only thing I use in earnest. The colour FX sound terrrible to my ears....ok, noise is fun to play with when you cut it in and out, but that's it. Dub echo and the filter are unusable.



So, I have a fair amount of kit, but don't always use it all together. I like rotary, that would mean Mastersounds Radius 2 / 4 given I'm in the UK, potentially an Ecler WARM4. I like the idea of the Xone PX5 as want that analogue sound, the effects all sound very similar, but hey...I like an echo!

The DJM A9 is a no. The V10 - dunno. Xone 92 is a hard pass as is the 96.

So, what else am I missing?



Is it really down to:

1. Radius 2 / 4
2. Xone PX5
3. WARM 4

Due to this I have been booked for a bigger party in April (500-1000 people). The thing is that I have almost exclusively played on my own gear (Serato + DDJ-SB2) in all of my gigs over the years. But now I have to use the big CDJ‚Äôs (2000 or 3000‚Äôs idk yet) and I am looking for some advice. 

Things I have done to prepare already:
-Bought some good USB-sticks for my music
-Downloaded Rekordbox and put my Serato crates on there and flashed it to the USB‚Äôs
-Bought a second-hand DDJ-400 so that I can use Rekordbox DJ to practice with my new library (a lot of tracks are in different places than Serato)

I have always just turned up, put down my gear and started playing, I can play for 6 hours with all the music I have, which I have done plenty of times. But now I am playing 1 hour on gear I barely know (aside from yt videos). 
I have used CDJ2000‚Äôs once before in an empty room for about 30 mins but that only gave me time to know my sticks work and to get to know how the library scrolling works lol. 

Any advice, tips, links,‚Ä¶ on how to prepare and deliver one hour of awesome mixing on this new gear? Things to watch out for as to not make the night come to a grinding halt due to technical issues like the ‚Äúemergency loop‚Äù I heard about?"

For example, if I‚Äôm playing a song on Deck 1, I‚Äôll throw the same song on Deck 3 with a track I intend to mix in Deck 2 and try to queue up a good transition in my headphones. Once I find that good spot, I‚Äôll be able to mix in once Deck 1 reaches that same spot. 

Do other people do this? Or what is a good way to transition on the fly?

630,CDJ 2000 NXS v1 weird looping behaviour,2,DJs,3,"Hello everyone :) 

Last night I was playing on the above CDJs in a club in London, I had all my tracks prepared so that they start with hot cue loops and ended on active loops. Tried them all on my XDJ 700s and they worked fine. 

On the CDJ 2000 NXS v1 decks the only way I could exit each loop was if slip mode was turned on, otherwise the 'reloop exit' button would do nothing and I‚Äôd be looping forever.

 However, then the only way the active loop would work was if slip mode was turned off again, otherwise it would ignore the loop altogether. Then it would have to be on again so you could exit the loop again‚Ä¶

So this meant I had to learn this behaviour quickly (after a few embarrassing mixes) and remember to turn it on-off-on for every mix I did‚Ä¶ so much more confusing than on the XDJ 700 and XDJ 1000 decks that I‚Äôve used.  

Is this how all CDJ 2000 NXS (v1 & v2) decks work? Or were these just acting strange? 

They were a bit battered and the sound tech guy didn‚Äôt know how to connect the monitor to the mixer so I don‚Äôt have much trust in the venue to know what they‚Äôre doing!

I tried researching it but couldn‚Äôt find anything that matched what I experienced‚Ä¶ thanks in advance!"

633,"Philosophy on mixing and producing 
",0,DJs,18,"TL;DR: Producers keep producing amazing songs and DJs keep mixing amazing songs

So I just wanted to word vomit something I've been thinking about in regards to producing and DJing. I myself am not a producer though I surely will make the plunge to find my own voice in that realm eventually. So that means I mostly focus on my mixing and curation skills to make my sets feel dynamic and new. For me I find most of my satisfaction with DJing to be when I forget trying to easily flow from one into/buildup/breakdown to the next and simply try to make the songs ""talk"" to each other. What I mean by that is... think about your own voice, you know the sound of it so intimately and you know the almost imperceptible changes that happen to your voice on any given day. As Producers you are making tracks that feature your voice and they are what get you moving and it's a beautiful thing to witness. Now think to when you are with your friends/family/coworkers... to hear other people's voices and how they react to you and even react to themselves when they are around others. There's an almost childlike wonder in that discovery right?? So for me I like to see how other people's voices (songs) react with a each other and mix through both of them for as long as I can maintain the ""conversation"" and like the natural flow of a conversation there are points where one party is dominating and other points where it's a harmonious back-and-forth and that's how I see myself as a DJ. Don't get me wrong everyone has therlir own style when it comes to showcasing their work but since I don't necessarily have work of my own the way I can find my ""voice"" in DJing is finding that happy centerline between 2 or more songs that create this ""conversation"" in the mix that can't be replicated truly unless you record it because with that I don't like finding one flow within a Playlist and that is my set like a child I like to choose new things try different combos so it's all the same Playlist but never the same songs together so I can find different ""conversations"". I'm not sure if this will resonate with Producers and DJs of the like but all I'm saying is your (producer's) voices while amazing separately are brought up to an even higher level when they are allowed to ""communicate"" with others to even further show the oneness that is your voice (song)."

641,Landing gigs feels impossible to me. (Ive tried it all),41,DJs,100,"Some back info
i have been djing since i was 9 years old currently i am 20. I primarily play hardcore and techno which are the most popular genres where im from. I have been also been producing those genres for about 6 years. The producing is going really well, i have about 60 releases 7k avg monthly listeners on spotify and if you add all the numbers up around 2m streams. 650 followers on insta and thats about it. 

What i‚Äôve tried so far:

Networking 
Ive been networking for years but im not all that great with people it seems, I‚Äôve just been talking to people or at least trying to. I‚Äôve been going to mostly smaller parties in my area seeming with bigger parties its impossible to even get close to djs. I do get to play at some house parties every 3 months, but this isnt really getting me anywhere seeming usually theres about 20-50 people there.

Emails, emails upon emails.
Long emails, short emails, casual emails, business emails, mass emails, personal emails etc etc etc

Talent gigs and competitions 
I landed quite a few of these over the years and won a few prizes, but it all ended the same met new people but nothing happened

Radio gigs/livestreams
Played about a dozen of these, really fun to do but so far no luck at landing actual gig

I can go on with things ive tried, but i think you get the point. The reason i put it here in the first place is to avoid having to type that 20 times trying to explain it to people in the comments. Ive put my entire life on music, studies etc but its getting so depressing the last months.

Anyways i would really love to hear your suggestions!"

643,How much should I charge to DJ a prom?,7,DJs,36,"I just got asked from a local high school to DJ their prom in a few months. They told me that they wanted variety from their last DJ (not surprising since most DJs in the area have had the same playlist for the last 15 years). They said that they usually get charged $500 for an 8-11 gig. 

This event is in the downtown area, which is roughly 30-45 minutes from me roughly. They are expecting around 1,100 kids to attend. I‚Äôm a mobile DJ that has experience with dances from the 300-400 range, but not enough equipment for this setup. I‚Äôm going to have to rent some equipment for adequate sound. This means the additional work of grabbing the extra equipment and making several trips. 

I know I'll have to ask for more than $500 for this gig, but how in the hell does somebody charge $500 for an event this size. I would love if somebody could find any rational reason for this cheap price and how they could provide enough sound at this size. What would be a reasonable asking price?"

648,Help Needed: Setting Up NS4FX Numark DJ Controller with Apollo X4 on MacBook Pro for Zero Latency,0,DJs,7,"EDIT:  
Hello everyone,

I'm in need of some advice to optimize my setup involving an NS4 Numark DJ controller, an Apollo X4 UAD interface, and a MacBook Pro. My goal is twofold: achieve zero latency for my DJ controller and utilize the Apollo X4 to route Autotune and other vocal mixing effects through microphones during live sessions.

Current setup details:

* NS4 Numark DJ controller connected to the MacBook Pro via USB, requiring separate power.
* Apollo X4 UAD interface connected via Thunderbolt 3.

The issue I'm facing includes a slight, yet noticeable lag when using DJ apps, and I'm unable to use the headphone jack on the controller for cueing. Moreover, I want to simultaneously connect my DJ controller and Apollo interface to manage live vocal effects efficiently.

I believe the challenge lies in the specific routing or configuration needed to use both the USB controller and audio interface together seamlessly, especially for live vocal processing through the Apollo.

Does anyone have experience with this kind of setup or any insights on eliminating latency, enabling headphone cueing, and effectively routing vocal effects? Your suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help!"

651,Recover deleted Denon DJ mixes - SC Live 4 and other controllers,1,DJs,0,"Hey,

So recently I finished a mix and shutdown my Denon SC Live 4, pressed confirm on shutdown UI notice before realising I hadn't saved the mix :( . Luckily I was able to get it back and wanted to share my experience for others who might get into this little mess.

I thought at first the file would be deleted as nothing was on my usb. Had no idea where to start with all these data recovery sites as most are just BS and want your money. Luckily I found something called Recuva. Same company that makes CCleaner which you might of heard of and I've used for years, which I was surprised at.

Got the usual message about paid version ect ect but got the free version instead, don't waste you're money. Free one had what I wanted anyways, to get my mix back. Installed and ran the recovery search, hoping and hoping it was there. Didn't use their ""deep scan"" as it said about extended time to scan.

After a little while it showed some of the files I deleted before and luckily the mix was there! Pressed recover and checked it and was all good!

Of course not everyone may be lucky in getting their mix / tracks back but I wanted to share this as I'm sure there'll be someone in the future with the same issue. There's lots more data recovery software out there, probably hundreds of different software that work great too, this is just what worked for me.

660,NEW RANE DJ GEAR ?,13,DJs,25,
661,So last gig was quite a challenge...,68,DJs,41,"Last week i had a voluntary 4 hour gig for our group of about 100 people during a holiday trip. I would bring my laptop with rekordbox and my music, some speakers and simple lights, and a friend would bring a DDJ-800, so we could have a party with the whole group.

Normally i always prefer to use my own gear, but i have an Opus and a FLX4; the opus is way to big to bring on a holiday and the FLX4 is a bit basic, so the DDJ-800 would be a great step up from the FLX4.

At the evening of the party, we are setting up the speakers, lights and eventually the DJ setup. However, at that moment we found out that the power adapter of the DDJ-800 isn‚Äôt working anymore! At that moment we tried to find a computer shop for a replacement power supply and drove over, but unfortunately it was hard to find a universal power supply with the right connector.. Even when we found one with the right connector, it didn‚Äôt connect that well, and didn‚Äôt provide a steady connection. (a small bump against the cable or connector resets the controller)

At that point we had a few options:

* Cancel the party
* Playing music through spotify
* Try to play/mix music in rekordbox with keyboard and mouse

This is where i was getting quite frustrated, i was really looking forward to this party, had some great tunes prepped and was ready to raise the roof!

Cancelling wasn‚Äôt really a option, the group was expecting a party and looking forward to it.

So I decided to do the party with rekordbox without a controller‚Ä¶

I almost never play through rekordbox (i prefer standalones), so that would be quite a challenge.

In the small time I got left, I looked up the hotkeys for cue/play, so I could start a track with the keyboard and then mix with the crossfader using the mouse. No EQ‚Äôing possible, but i‚Äôve got to play the cards I got dealt‚Ä¶

Then I even found out it wasn‚Äôt even possible to prelisten to tracks. Even though i had rekordbox hooked up to an external mixer with USB, i was expecting to be able to use the internal soundcard for prelistening.

When the party started, I needed a few tracks to get the hang of using the mouse and keyboard for mixing, but i got there.

It was an all-round party, so luckily i didn‚Äôt need to beatmix every transition. I used beat sync for the beatmatched transitions and kept them short because i couldn‚Äôt use EQ.

I know my music quite good, so i could pick tracks without prelistening, and used the waveforms to ‚Äòread‚Äô the tracks and decide on starting cuepoints. (for some tracks they were already set)

In the end we had a great party! Maybe not the best transitions, but the whole group enjoyed the tracks and had a great evening! I never want to mix with keyboard and mouse again, but i‚Äôm very happy it worked out quite fine.

This party just confirms again that mixing skills and gear are really not the most important, it‚Äôs all about track selection and track knowledge.

Could the party be better with the controller? Yes, probably! (and a lot easier!) Would the crowd notice? I don‚Äôt think so, most of the group didn‚Äôt even notice I was playing just from my laptop.

TL/DR: Had issues with the controller when setting up the gig, played the gig with mouse and keyboard without being able to prelisten. Still blew the roof off! It‚Äôs all about the tracks ;)"

668,When do djs start playing classics,0,DJs,63,Just a question that triggers my noodle. But when do djs start playing classic tracks from the past. I asked this because most guys will play all of this newer stuff. But when they hit a certain age like their 50s. They start playing old tunes that they use to play. I asked this because I'm 32 years old and I'm not ready to throw in the old school in my dj sets just yet.

671,Traktor Z2 & Vinyl,5,DJs,15,"Hi all,

I'm currently running a vinyl-only setup at home with a Xone 23 and turntables. I'm now very close to picking up a Traktor Z2 so I can play a mix of vinyl and DVS. My only concern is that there may be a drop in sound quality when playing vinyl.

Can anyone comment on the quality of the Z2's phono preamps? If anyone has experience playing vinyl through both the Z2 and Xone 23, I would love to hear about your experience.

I'm under no illusions about the quality of my setup - my current gear is low-budget, but sounds decent enough to me. I'd like to keep things sounding nice.

Thanks!"
672,Algorithmic curation is killing music culture,98,DJs,80,"At least according to this editorial in RA. 

Two things:

1. Kyle Chaka is an OG tech journalist and is worth reading
2. A few key quotes below:

> In his new book, The New Yorker staff writer Kyle Chayka outlines why he thinks algorithms are ruining a person's ability to develop unique taste. Mathematically determined recommendations on social media, streaming and other platforms are deciding what music, food, art and entertainment becomes popular, he explains. The algorithm promotes the widest possible average, ""informing the songs we listen to, the friends with whom we stay in touch,"" he writes, warning that culture is getting homogenised as a result.

Also from another quote:

> Monoculture is stronger than ever, he noted, pointing to how people across the world are consuming the same narratives and aesthetics being pushed across mainstream media. 

>""That's not where I listen to music or look for music‚ÄìI go to gigs, I listen to radio and I talk to my friends,"" he said. ""Subculture is just nowhere near the stuff we're being shown.""

That last paragraph is gold. 

Moral of the story; don‚Äôt equate streams with success (or even quality). And don‚Äôt get your music from top 100 playlists."
673,XDJ-RX2 self-repair,1,DJs,1,"I have an XDJ-RX2 that has a semi-functional headphone jack, only supplying audio to one ear. Otherwise everything else is in great shape. This part seems to be around $50 from various suppliers. I live in Seattle and the nearest Pioneer service center is in Glendale, CA - not worth shipping it back and forth just for this repair. Has anyone swapped out this part before or even just cracked open an RX2 and could offer any advice for self-repair? It looks like a deceptively simple swap, which makes me wonder what I'm missing. I've seen a few threads on successful self-repair of the RZ which is a more complicated controller, so I'm hopeful the RX2 is straightforward enough to repair myself."
674,What is it with music getting...shorter?,94,DJs,183,"Was checking out a few new tunes, and I'm finding it strange when I see so many supposedly new ""club"" tunes are more very short versions, like 2 1/2 to 3 minutes long, and a supposedly ""extended"" version is 4 minutes. Plus I see many with no intro or outro like we normally get

What the hell?  Used to be a club track we'd buy is like 5-8 minutes long.  Did I miss something?

I went looking and heard ""TikTok"" but I find this ridiculous for club music to be so short like that."
675,USB-C Durability: A possible solution?,5,DJs,39,"Call me paranoid but I think the USB-C ports on newer DJ gear are going to potentially be a point of failure. This is mobile-spec port which is *relatively* durable but is still not as durable as the old USB Type B connector. My solution to this is [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0B8X6H96S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

My idea is this: get these adapaters, plug them into the USB-C ports on the decks and leave them connected. Plug my USB-C cable into the adapter rather than the port of the deck. This will save wear on the port. If the adapter starts to wear down, no biggie, i can replace the adapter and i'll be good to go for another x-y years. This potentially avoids the need for sending off the decks for USB-C repair, or dealing with awkward intermittent connection issues.

I'd be interested to know your thoughts anyways, cheers all.

I'm looking to play a local club that turns into a lounge on weekdays. It's a great vibe although the lighting isn't as dark as most are used to in a club/semi-club setting. Obviously turning the lights down at a lounge isn't the best idea. 

I feel like a mister/hazer/fog/haze machine (NOT SMOKE) could really improve the vibe, even if there's no lasers or lighting being employed. I swear I've seen a constant hazy state at super clubs like Stereo and think it could really add to the atmosphere the promoters are after."

682,The lesson I learned this weekend,124,DJs,31,"I played at a festival over the weekend. I had two sets, one directly after the opening ceremony on the main stage in the evening, the other was Sunday mid afternoon. 

First set was fine. Totally happy with it and the crowd vibed and danced to what I played. 

For the Sunday set, I knew I needed to bring something different, but for it still to be ‚Äòmy‚Äô sound. So, as a hip hop/funk/breaks DJ and it being the last day of a three day festival, I complied a laid back collection of slower beats with nice bass lines, that a crowd could sway along to.

The DJs before played Afro house, ecstatic dance and ended with techno. The crowd were really up for it and dancing along furiously. This is when I second guessed my decision and instead of starting my set as I had planned, I dropped some breaks to keep the crowd dancing at the pace that had been set. It kinda worked, but the novelty of raving in the afternoon wore off, so I reverted back to my original plan and slowed it right down to 80-90-100bpm beats and it worked. The crowd swelled in numbers, the head nodding and swaying I had imagined beforehand was happening, and the Sunday summery vibe was set. I just wish that I had trusted myself and not tried to follow on from something that someone else had built.

The lesson I learned? Play what you know will set a vibe. It‚Äôs better to play from your heart, than to try and match someone else."
683,Mix sharing Subreddits are Echo Chambers,26,DJs,47,"There are numerous subreddits to upload mixes to but they're all ghost towns when it comes to interaction. I am thinking most of their users are content creators who don't have time or patience to listen to each other's content. Even when I actively try to do this myself, being genuine about it isn't easy. You basically need to dedicate like an hour to listening to someone's mix if you intended to try to provide constructive feedback.

I recently arrived in Hamburg since I'll be doing my master's degree for the next two years. I would like to know if there are WhatsApp or Telegram groups related to Techno culture or events in general. Also, groups of Latino people who are interested in Techno would be helpful. 

Moreover, being a DJ from Colombia, mainly focused on hypnotic Techno and Hardgroove, I would like to receive advice on how to get more involved in the scene, to get chances to play in clubs and events possibly. I just find kinda weird and difficult to talk to people at parties because most people want to listen to the music and enjoy the party. Also, I don't speak fluent German, which makes it even harder to talk to people. 

In conclusion, I would appreciate it if you guys know any clubs, collectives, or radios that would be willing to accept new DJs to play. Also, I accept any advice to make connections with other DJs. 

Thank you for reading and for the help!"
688,Self-Made Tonal Samples?,2,DJs,3,"I'm at the point where I want to start creating my own samples for mixes and sets, and I'm wondering how others handle the workflow when it comes to tonal samples like hits or loops (sounds that have a distinct note or key, not atonal like a hi hat). Do you make the same sound in multiple keys (ie, A, C, D, E, G, and G#, etc.), and hope that you have the sample in the right key for the song you want to layer it over, or do you just create 1 sample at 1 key / note, and just go with it? I can imagine that having a sample / sound in multiple keys would be great to have, but the library management aspect of it seems impossible. 

PS - I thought about posting this in r/Beatmatch but ultimately wanted to get the opinion of more advanced DJ's that also make their own samples, or even their own music. Happy to repost it there if that's where this question belongs."

695,Challenges for New DJs: A Tech Perspective,0,DJs,139,"As someone with a computer science background who recently ventured into DJing, I‚Äôve encountered several challenges, particularly with the technology used in DJing. After a few months into this journey, I‚Äôve realized that the tech aspect seems lacking.

One major task involves listening to numerous tracks daily. Subsequently, I spend hours analyzing these tracks to determine compatibility, identifying which tracks mesh well together, and exploring various transition techniques.

Would it be accurate to state that one of the primary challenges for DJs, especially newcomers, is the extensive analysis required to find hot cues, and devise potential transition strategies between tracks? It feels like there could be more efficient solutions than manually tagging tracks for vocals, drums, bass, etc.

Am I alone in thinking this, or is this a shared challenge within the DJ community?"

704,Are the days of MixedInKey over?,7,DJs,58,"When I started to DJ I became a big fan of MixedInKey. Because I made my first steps into the profession with an off project by the same company called ""Flow 8 Deck"" which was a DJ software with some unique features like displaying the different keys  of a track and not just one. 

But soon i reached the limitations of Flow8Deck and moved on to rekordbox with the help of MixedInKey. As a newbie I was still unsure where to put my hotcues and how to beatgrid and MixedInKey helped me with it. 

Nowadays I do not consider the automatic cues of MixedInKey helpful although i still import them with the Cue and Key tool most of the time I end up deleting them. 

This leaves with only the key detection, which is probably good enough to do it just with rekordbox and remove a big part of my new track workflow.

What are your experiences with MixedInKey do you consider it useful?

705,Pioneer DJM800 or NI Traktor Kontrol Z2?,3,DJs,7,"Hello, good people.

Based in a country where it's very hard to find mixers. By asking around, I have managed to find two mixers: The Pioneer DJM800 (4 channels) and the NI Traktor Kontrol Z2 (2+2 channels), both used.

My setup is a pair of CDJs and one (but sometimes two) turntable(s). I need a mixer mostly for home use with the occasional gig, but nothing crazy in clubs. Just chill, radio-show-style gigs where I just cue one track after another.

Now the DJM800 is being sold for $370 and the Z2 for $520. The Z2 is in a great condition (purchased in 2018), while the DJM800, while not heavily used, comes with a broken crossfader and a broken knob that needs fixing. I am considering it because I don't really scratch DJ.

My budget is up to $400. Is getting an old DJM800 worth it in 2024? I checked its prices in Japan and it still seems to be in high demand and is going for much higher prices (probably because it has achieved classic status?), but from what I read online, the sound quality on the DJM800 isn't very good and it also doesn't come with a sound card built in?

The Z2 on the other hand doesn't need any repairs, but would I overpaying if I'm getting it for $520? Purchasing the mixer here does cost more than getting it elsewhere because of the import tax laws in my country.

I would really appreciate it if someone here could share their thoughts on what I should do.

Please keep in mind that I can't consider other mixers because they are simply not available in my country right now."

729,Saddest gig you've had?,89,DJs,146,"Before the pandemic hit, I would occasionally DJ at this club out of town. The club was new and the town was small. On average, maybe 10-20 people a night. It was bad. Management had no idea what they were doing and their marketing attempts were nonexistent. It didn't help that the other clubs were much more established and had a pretty good monopoly on the area.

Around Christmas time, there's an annual pub crawl called 12 Barz. Each city has their own set of venues and lucky for us, our club was selected as one of the stops. Management decided that this would be a great opportunity to hire an artist to perform and brought in JRDN. Throughout this period, they marketed the event nonstop and made a new JRDN post every day.

Fast forward to the night of the pub crawl, I arrived and had music on for 10. Around 11, the group arrives and the club is fully packed. Everyone's having a great time singing and by 11:15, it was empty again. I don't think the owner realized that they would just be coming by briefly because he looked shocked. JRDN arrived with his crew around midnight and we ended up talking for the rest of the night. He didn't end up performing and no one else showed up afterwards.

This was by far one of the saddest gigs I've ever had. The next saddest gig I had was for a birthday party where the guy rented out a big ass venue and only 10-20 people showed up. In terms of sheer scale, this one was definitely worse. The owner just looked so defeated afterwards that I don't think he ever recovered from that night.

Anyone else have any similar experiences?

Edit: Dumpster fires are appreciated too! My buddy had a beer tossed at him by some redneck uncle and had some guy ram his finger up his ass when his assistant went to pee lol."

733,Apple Music Library,0,DJs,3,"I have been using iTunes/Apple Music for a long time and just bought a new laptop. I backed up my files via Time Machine ready for new laptop. 

Loaded up the Apple Music back-up on new laptop 15% of the catalogue had missing tags, genre, artwork and playlists. I've since gone through every track and updated the tags, removed duplicates etc (not the missing playlists yet). 

Is this a common problem? 

I wanted to organise all my music ASAP (quite organised as all on one place and genre/artist/title tagged) before I load up into Serato/Rekordbox. 

However, now that I have finished updating the incorrect tagged library I am keen to move away from Apple Music and maybe just use folders instead as this has been a hassle and want to avoid for any future back-ups. 

I am considering creating new folders specified by genre/year. Apple Music creates all music as Artist>Album>Title. I wondered, is this as easy as just dragging tracks directly from Apple Music and dropping them into a folder (EG Electronic, Disco etc). Will all tags cross over if I was to do this.

Ideally want to be able to do sort it in a clean way so that any future back are a breeze. 

Final thing - I've read you can't update file names in DJ software (Rekordbox/Serato), so if you do play your tracks from folders only (with no Apple Music/lexicon etc) how do you name your files with the correct genre/artist/title etc? As there is only one box area to update any standard filter on Mac.

734,Anyone else get tired of listening to music in general and only really do it as a part of DJing now?,66,DJs,89,"I‚Äôm more just curious to see what others think because my friends and gf think I‚Äôm nuts. I‚Äôve been DJing consistently for the past 10 years, 2-3 gigs a week, and I still love doing it, with no plans to stop anytime soon. However, one toll the job has taken on me is that because I‚Äôm so constantly surrounded by music and spend so much time actively listening for the purpose of screening songs for my sets, I‚Äôve gotten to the point where music in any context outside of DJing is basically noise and I derive no pleasure from listening to it, even within the genres I like playing out. I used to love going to concerts and festivals, but I now find them excruciatingly boring unless I‚Äôm either DJing them or analyzing another DJ‚Äôs set to help improve my own. So like if I‚Äôm driving, working at my day job, at the gym or whatever, I basically never listen to music and instead opt for podcasts or audiobooks instead. I‚Äôll even just put in earplugs and embrace the silence if I really need to focus on something. None of my other DJ friends seem to feel this way, so I‚Äôm curious if anyone here has experienced anything similar?"

738,Question about fees for international festival gigs and travel,5,DJs,6,"Hey so this is kind of an awkward / newbie question but for the first time ever I'm in a position where a festival wants to book me for a prime slot and has asked for my conditions.And I feel a little lost on what to answer.

It's not my first international gig but usually clubs and promoters just offer me a certain sum and I accept in any case because I'm just happy to play and visit the country. I have no agency backing me and still feel quite new to all of this (1 year playing official gigs), so I'm not great at negotiating for myself.

I'm not sure if I should ask for the same amount I would get at a local, regular club gig or if international festivals are different? Of course I'm going to ask to have travel expenses and accommodation covered. But should I ask for a higher fee since I'll be traveling for most of the weekend and can't play other gigs as to compensate for the potential loss? The set would only be 2h but I would either have to travel 10h by train or half a day when flying.

What else should I be asking for? I usually just send out a tech rider with my minimum requirements but I've seen other DJs ask for meals, breakfast the following day etc.I want to be professional and not sell myself ""under value"" but I'm afraid of asking for too much just for them to end up ghosting me.... It's a small, local festival but taking place in a rich county in Europe and it seems like they have some funding. They've also invited much bigger names than me in the past so I feel a bit intimidated lol

742,How are you keeping up with the sheer amount of music today and staying ahead of the curve of what's hot?,50,DJs,64,"I'm an old head and haven't spun a club gig in over 10 years. I was mainly a hip hop/open format DJ. I was just talking to an old DJ friend and he told me he quit 2 years ago because he simply couldn't keep up with the sheer amount of music and requests for unofficial youtube/remixes/tiktok songs. 

When I was DJing, Billboard top 40-100 was the backbone of my entire night set. Whatever was at the top of Billboard was my peak bangers that would for sure get the dancefloor filled. So as long as I had all the top billboard songs, I'd be mostly fine for the night.  I'd have a crate my old school classics that didn't really change. 

Then I'd have niche crates for subgenres that were hot at the time like an EDM crate, a dancehall reggae crate, a bmore club crate. To keep up with those it took being in the club bar scene and just seeing how crowds react to these rarer tracks that you don't hear on the radio. It also took a bunch of scouring forums, record pools, and record shops to get my hands on these rarer tracks.

Now billboard is far less relevant. There's not really a singular chart, top 20, or MTV/BET/Radio countdown that you can follow to know what's popular. TikTok and social media dictates alot of what music is popular. Sometimes old songs all of a sudden become popular like Fleetwood Mac Dreams blew up because of that guy skateboarding drinking cranberry juice. There are so many avenues to discover music that it's overwhelming. How are DJ's today keeping up with all of it?"

very small yorkville sub

I‚Äôve looked at the ProReck Club line and just think there is something not all there with the price for what you get. I‚Äôve also looked into the QSC K series, JBL PRX series, and the Yamaha DXR series, and they are just a bit out of our price range.

Another fraternity that is always next to us uses a column speaker (not sure on brand) and it seems like it produces very good vocals that carry very far.

747,[How-to] What to do when your SoundSwitch autoscripts are suddenly empty after syncing your (Denon) Engine DJ library,7,DJs,2,"I recently had a bit of a nail-biting experience where I spent a long time autoscripting 100+ tracks on SoundSwitch for use with Engine Lighting on my Prime 4, only for the contents of the scripts I made to completely disappear. I thought I had lost a few dozen hours of work, only a couple days before my next gig. I couldn't find any definitive (working) answers on other forums, and support is rather slow given they're on the other side of the globe from me. I figured I'd share the dumb mistake I made and how I fixed it so that someone else may benefit down the road.

\---

**Here are the symptoms relevant to the situation:**

1) You have gone and autoscripted some tracks for use with SoundSwitch.

2) After syncing your library with Engine DJ, your autoscripted songs now show up blank, as if they've never been analyzed or scripted.

3) The ""SS"" logo may still appear in SoundSwitch next to the songs you previously scripted.

4) Clicking ""Rebuild TrackMap"" does not fix anything, and if #3 was true, the ""SS"" logo is now gone as well.

5) When you look in the directory for your SoundSwitch project, you still see plenty of .ssfile and .ssa files.

\---

**Here is what happened in my situation:**

I had foolishly been creating autoscripts \*directly on my Prime 4's internal SSD\*, not on my computer. What this means is that rather than accessing my music library on my computer, which I then sync to my Prime 4's drive, I accessed my music directly on my Prime 4 from SoundSwitch.

*Why this is a problem*

The way SoundSwitch identifies tracks is by inserting a custom metadata tag on each song you create an autoscript for. As far as I can tell, Engine DJ does not sync track metadata back to the library on your computer. Therefore, even if Engine DJ says ""new data to sync"" from your controller back to your computer, it's not going to copy over the custom metadata SoundSwitch inserted when you created a script.

However, when you sync from your computer over to your controller, Engine DJ \*will overwrite\* the metadata for your library, including the songs you created autoscripts for. Since the tracks on your local library don't have the custom SoundSwitch metadata tag, that tag gets erased on your controller during sync. At this point, due to the TrackMap, SoundSwitch will likely still show an ""SS"" logo next to the tracks you created scripts for, but clicking on those tracks will show you a totally empty file as if you haven't done any work. Clicking ""Rebuild TrackMap"" will ruin things further because SoundSwitch will examine your music library, search for its custom metadata tag in each song, find none, and then wipe out all ""SS"" logos because it did not find any music file with the tag indicating it has a script.

\---

**How I fixed it:**

Based on what I've already described, you may have an idea of where this is going. After figuring out how SoundSwitch works with music files, here is what got me back on my feet:

1) Open your song or library directory with a music tag editor such as [MP3Tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/).

2) Click on the track you want to re-attach an automation to and press Alt+T.

3) Click to add a new tag with the name SOUNDSWITCH\_ID. The data field should contain the \*precise\* name of the .ssfile (found in your SoundSwitch project directory) which corresponds to that particular track. For example, if I know that the file {D65B6572-A50F-4C5F-AD6E-8FE1E6546102}.ssfile corresponds with the track in my library called ""I'm Good"", I'd open up ""I'm Good"" in MP3Tag, click it, press Alt+T, add a new field with the name SOUNDSWITCH\_ID and the data {D65B6572-A50F-4C5F-AD6E-8FE1E6546102}.

4) Repeat this for every. single. track. Tedious? Absolutely. Better than losing dozens of hours of work? Also absolutely.

*However, this begs the question... how in the world do you correlate .ssfile names with their respective tracks?*

This is where things get really tricky, and where I honestly got really lucky. I had created a playlist for my gig, and had gone down the list from top-to-bottom creating a script for each track. Therefore, I was able to sort my SoundSwitch project directory by ""Created At"", start with the earliest-created .ssfile, know that correlated with the first track in my playlist, and then move down from there. 

If you created scripts at random, things are going to be much, much harder for you, and you may spend more time trying to match up tracks to .ssfiles than you would just completely re-doing the scripts altogether. Do note, however, that correlating the wrong .ssfile to the wrong track doesn't hurt anything as long as you don't save. You can open it up and it will be very obvious that things don't match up. Looking at the script itself may also help you to know which track it actually belongs to!

\---

**After all was said and done...**

It took me a couple hours to correlate metadata tags to the 100+ tracks. This time, of course, I made sure to create the scripts while navigated to the library on my \*computer\*, NOT on my Prime 4. Things looked good, I synced using Engine DJ from my computer to my Prime 4, and everything finally, finally worked.

Hopefully this helps someone at some point, or even better, helps someone to avoid making the same dumb mistake I did. Needless to say, I've been thoroughly enjoying SoundSwitch / Engine Lighting despite some quirks and needed improvements, and look forward to what they do in the future."

749,Guidance needed from vets: hi end corp. client acquisition in NYC for mobile gigs / how to get paid more,4,DJs,25,"So, this appears to be borderline a r/beatmatch post, but hear me out, it‚Äôs more nuanced.

Hey. I‚Äôm Roman. I live in New York City, and I‚Äôve been a high level nightclub DJ for about five years here. Played in just about every club in NY. people tell me I‚Äôm one of the best. I don‚Äôt have a big head about it, but I know I do pretty well, and I‚Äôm looking for further opportunities to grow, progress, and make money.  I‚Äôm feeling stagnant after running laps around the circuit and not getting any further ahead financially. (I‚Äôm a full time DJ). I want to devote more of my time to music production, but am in a weird place.

I‚Äôm well aware that the real money is in corporate events, traveling and private events, though I have a great website and great visibility in the city, I feel like I don‚Äôt have the contacts for this type of work.

I do advertise myself as the cool club DJ on my site -Romanchappelle.com, because I didn‚Äôt want to be seen as a birthday party DJ or cheap mobile DJ.  I wanted to be seen as underground and club cool, and am ultimately an artist. it worked out, I built my brand well, and I‚Äôm trusted at what I do at many high-end clubs and hotels as well as the underground.

Now I still want to be cool. I produce music, and I travel, playing in aspen next week- but I‚Äôm also aware that I feel I‚Äôm leaving money on the table by not pursuing more of the right mobile gigs. I have got a few inbounds on my website for events, but not nearly as many as I‚Äôve got talking to people.

I have some equipment I would like to do more high end corp/brand gigs, consistently.  Nike, fashion, Google parties etc. 



I‚Äôve signed up for bark and thumbtack, but I don‚Äôt want to do 16 year old birthday parties for 300 bucks. That‚Äôs not worth the money I spend on gear and transportation. I can also make that during a club night not bringing any gear, usually more.



I‚Äôm looking to work with higher end clients- $1500 and up. Do you all have any experience with PR companies, and larger event producers? Goals are gigs for fashion week, large corporate events, and industry conferences. As a New Yorker I know these things happen every single day and have done work for Tissot, IMG, soho house, etc. The frustrating part is that I am in touch with agents annd agencies, the gigs are just so infrequent that they‚Äôre almost 1 a quarter. 

I haven‚Äôt broken in consistently yet.

Being vulnerable here, as a full-time nightclub DJ, I sometimes feel like I am struggling to survive financially, even while I am doing the flashiest gigs, and playing the best clubs in the city, and do make $300 an hour more than occasionally.

At this point I‚Äôm well aware that my mathematics are in need of more consistent high end clients, and nightclubs just don‚Äôt pay the bills. Do I need to be signed to an agency? Should I start my own? Maybe it‚Äôs a marketing issue- and if you look at my Instagram, I have removed a lot of my nightclub work because I‚Äôm starting to replace it with artist cntent, my own music, and better branding, because I no longer just want to be seen as a nightclub guy.

I‚Äôve already received the basic guidance of check out agencies, network more, etc.  looking to ask for some experienced perspectives. I don‚Äôt want to leave any more money on the table. I eventually plan to be able to sell tickets at more major venues, and be more of an artist doing big numbers, but getting there, I have to pay the bills.

  
I am also a copywriter on the side, so I know how to do a bit of marketing. Looking for any smart guidance, preferably from people who‚Äôve done it before. "

My philosophy is to play for the girls since they are the ones that tip me out, not the guests unless they request a certain song (for money). I hear some other DJ‚Äôs try and do a mix of both where they play for the girls and the guests, it seems more likely to piss off the girls.

756,Music Discovery,8,DJs,19,"DJs!! I have a question that i‚Äôd imagine may have crossed your mind too and am interested in your thoughts:

In my music discovery sessions i often find tracks that sound really great to me the first time, but as I listen a few more times before including them in my sets to make sure they don‚Äôt have details i may not like, i end up scrapping them.

Am i being overly analytical? i‚Äôm now thinking that if a track sounds great to me the first time, a majority of my audience would likely enjoy it too assuming they haven‚Äôt heard it before given i‚Äôm digging way deep in the underground world. 

What do yours think and curious to hear how other DJs go about this, TY!"
757,Profanity at weddings,31,DJs,64,"I‚Äôve been DJing weddings for around 12‚Äì13 years predominantly. Rarely have I run into this situation. There were very young kids 5-10years old. A lot of family in the 50+ range. The dance floor was popping all night besides dessert time. At about a half hour left, the bride insisted I play a certain set of songs ‚Äúand do not censor! This is my wedding and I don‚Äôt care! Make it ratchet!‚Äù So of course I obliged and played the requested rap songs. I like all of that stuff but felt it was too explicit in that situation. (And I‚Äôm not a prude lol also I don‚Äôt don‚Äôt play church clean stuff at my weddings either) Most of the older crowd cleared the F out. Curious as to the wedding DJs out there how you feel about that and what you do in that situation?"
758,"DJ Health - drinking, exercise, etc",23,DJs,44,"What are your thoughts on limiting drinking and keeping an exercise routine to improve post gig energy levels? I‚Äôm a mid 30‚Äôs guy and have noticed that playing listening bars and clubs 3-7 times a week can be physically and mentally draining - my lower legs feel sore and some sets lack the same creative juices that others have. 

One culprit I‚Äôm starting to suspect is alcohol. I‚Äôd usually have 1-3 drinks during a set. I didn‚Äôt think it was an issue bc I never felt tipsy let alone drunk. However I realize the total drinks per week are adding up and am openminded to the cumulative effects that could have. Also an international touring dj friend, same age, said she cut back to 1 drink a week and it made a difference.

I also don‚Äôt stretch or exercise much other than walking a mile or so around the city per day. But after just finishing a busy week my knees, calves, and feet are pretty sore. My off days kinda feel like recovery days.

My thoughts are to cut off the drinking for a month, take yoga a couple times a week, and order some inserts for my shoes. Have you been in a similar boat, if so what worked for you? Thanks for your time!"
759,MP3 Corrupts as I try to move from PC to USB,0,DJs,6,I‚Äôve downloaded 3 mixtapes from Bandcamp in both mp3 and WAV form and every time I try to move it from my PC over to my USB it says there‚Äôs an issue and it‚Äôs corrupted.

760,DJs who don't party,7,DJs,201,"I was inviting people to my party from a Facebook group. As it turned out, some of the group members were DJs and as I sent them my invitation, they replied that: ""Thank you, but I don't go to parties unless it's work and I am getting paid"". It was not a one time incident, and I saw a pattern emerging.

Well...
In my opinion it's quite sad when someone only go parties when he has to. Just imagine a porn-star who is at home with their partner: ""Sorry, I only have sex if I am working and getting paid"". Or a photographer who only opens his eyes to see the world when he works, otherwise he is wearing a blindfold.

Talking to these DJs was an instant turn off for me. I would not invite them to play at the events I organise if they have this burnt out attitude.

I am a DJ, and when I don't have a gig, then I am often going to parties or festivals where I even pay entrance, instead of getting paid. Am I the minority here?"
761,Day before gig have been told I am now going b2b with another DJ who has a different genre style. Tips?,6,DJs,30,"For context, I am a beginner DJ and producer who plays a lot of upbeat house music. Mainly tech house and deep tech/underground stuff. Things that don‚Äôt have many vocals but a lot of groove and nice bass lines.

Been booked in for this gig for over a month however 1 day ago the organisers told me a new DJ will be starting and therefore has told me I‚Äôll be having a b2b set.

The guy I‚Äôll be going back to back with is a friend of mine, but his genre is super melodic, happy, slow house tunes that you‚Äôd expect at a Martin Garrix show. Not ideal. 

I told them to change it but they say nothing can really be done. I had the closing slot (2nd best slot) and prepared a great hour long set with my music. However now being told I‚Äôll be going b2b with him, I‚Äôm worried about how the energy flow will go. Obviously I can‚Äôt play 3 deep tech house bangers for him to turn to 3 festival like David Guetta tracks. It‚Äôll just sound awkward. 

I told him to dig out some beats, and that he can use some from my USB, but I‚Äôm just annoyed really that the full 1 hour has been taken from me. I guess things like this happen, but as a semi-beginner DJ I really wanted the full slot to showcase my skills. I don‚Äôt want people in the crowd discrediting the set because the flow of the music is weird.

What‚Äôs your guys opinions on this?"

* Gather all the prepared tracks in 1 place, which has a music player that works well across devices (also mobile), so you always have access to listen to your songs.

We've looked at: 

* Rekordbox Sync Manager

771,How to... library purge?,3,DJs,12,"Hi everyone, I'm currently doing a library purge. I have about 3k songs that I collected over the past 2 years, but as my style is evolving and me not being picky when downloading songs I decided it was time to trim down.

This is how I'm tackling my problem: I go through all my songs in Finder on my Mac, then move songs I don't need anymore to a separate ""Archived"" folder. After that is finished, I want to remove all songs from my Rekordbox library and re-analyze the ones I kept. 

Also currently, I have separate folders in Finder for each genre. However, I want to change this to one big folder with all my music files and tag each song in Rekordbox as I make a lot of use of smart playlists. In the end, I want my Rekordbox to be organized and not the files on my computer, as the Rekordbox library is kind of the ""ground truth"".

What do you think of my approach? I think this should work for me, however, I want to create a good system/workflow that would make my life easier in the future, and I also want to avoid re-doing my library in the (near) future. How do you do it? Any tips and suggestions are welcome :)"

777,Laptop for Rekordbox - What can I get away with?,0,DJs,36,"I have used a Lenovo Yoga 510-14ISK with Rekordbox and Ableton for 5+ years and I need a new laptop. The battery is gone and the universe is telling me it's time to move on. 

I have recently got a job where I'll be DJ tutoring everyday and want something new. I'm trying to work out what is the cheapest laptop I can buy that will run Rekordbox smoothly (I use a DDJ-RX which doesn't take USB). My tracks are all on a hard drive so won't need loads of storage. 

My thought process behind getting one as cheap as possible is I want to have this laptop solely for this job. So in theory it just needs to be able to run Rekordbox and check work emails, maybe browse the web - that's it - other than that it'll be clean and unused. I'm never gonna use it to play out, as I'll use a USB stick in that case. And as for Ableton I'd like to buy a PC/ Mac and set up a proper studio.

This is really only going to make financial sense if I can get a laptop pretty cheap. Like couple of hundred quid if possible. I'm in the UK and saw these deals on Currys website:

https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-15.6-chromebook-intel-pentium-128-gb-emmc-blue-10251246.html

https://www.currys.co.uk/products/lenovo-ideapad-1-14-refurbished-laptop-intel-celeron-128-gb-ssd-blue-very-good-condition-10256799.html

I've seen people post in similar threads that i5 minimum is necessary, but my current laptop is i3 and has been fine running Rekordbox and Ableton and has mostly been fine. So I'm wondering if I can get away with something cheaper based on the above information.

If you've got this far thanks so much for reading and if you have any opinion on the matter would be interested to hear it."
778,Would Multi-Instrument Musicians Be Better DJs Initially?,9,DJs,51,"Hey guys,

I am a professional musician playing mainly solo for money, but also play in a few improv/jazz and rock bands. I play guitar, keys, drums, bass, and sing. I MC at a local open mic as well. I'm also decent with editing in DAWs like Ableton. I was just thinking about getting into DJing because I really like arangements and mashups, and it might be an easy way to make money with a skillset I might be further along in developing than I know. I also have a pretty good amount of sound equipment as it is.

I was just wondering how much crossover there is between these worlds! I don't really know where to start, but I think I'd be into DJing pop-funk/80s dance, classics, and some modern pop/rap - I feel like most DJs in my town have some odd taste, but tbh I'm pretty out of touch with what people my age like in terms of modern rap/hip-hop (I'm 24 and don't really like stereotypical modern pop rap lol).

780,How to deal with burnout when taking a break is not an option?,9,DJs,21,"Every once in a while, we all get burnt out and need to take a break. But I'm in a situation where I'm studying during the week days and playing pretty much every Friday and Saturday in the weekends.

I have a feeling that I'm kinda burnt out at the moment. I don't get excited to play, I barely spend any time on finding new music above the bare minimum, my energy during gigs is through the floor, usual burnout stuff you know. I really want to take a break and don't even drink, network nor go to afters anymore.

The thing is, my gigs pay my rent and put food on my table, so taking a break isn't really an option for me in the next couple of months, because the job market here kinda sucks. When I get a chance, I'm definitely taking a break. Until then, is there something I can do to reignite my previous excitement and motivation to play? Try to focus on something or any advice for this? Because I feel my performance is taking a hit and I don't like that.

I know I'm incredibly lucky to be in my position and I'm in no way ungrateful or anything, but burnout kinda sucks

791,First DJ gig went absolutely terrible! I need your advice!,10,DJs,228,"So, a bit of context. I‚Äôve been a bedroom DJ for almost two years now and I consider my DJing abilities to be quite good as of now as I practically master stuff like beatmatching, transitions, etc. I also have a music library that‚Äôs quite large (I ONLY play EDM, so mostly House, Trance, Techno, etc.). Up to this point I‚Äôve only played for myself in my own bedroom as a hobby (always having a blast), and a few times on very small gatherings with friends (not so much to play entire sets for them, but mostly to show them my controller and my music), but I consider my abilities and music library to be good enough to play at a club or festival anytime without any issues, or so I thought until last night. 

The whole thing was a shitshow, let me explain. So yesterday was my friend‚Äôs birthday and she decided to throw a party at her lake house. She asked me if I could bring my stuff and play a set at her party, and I accepted (for free). I‚Äôll admit that I didn‚Äôt prepare at all as I hadn‚Äôt practiced for days, hadn‚Äôt sorted my new songs, hadn‚Äôt even analyzed them on Rekordbox or set up hot cues (which I always do), etc. I was aware of all of this but I didn‚Äôt give it much importance as I had come up with killer sets on the fly in the past even with songs I had only listened to once, and people at raves are usually too drunk/high to even notice small mistakes. 

But there lies the problem, this was no rave, this was a house party. At most there were perhaps 12 to 15 people, AT MOST. Mostly distant ‚Äòfriends‚Äô and acquaintances, people who‚Äôve known me for years, and for most of them this was the first time they found out I‚Äôm a DJ. When I arrived the atmosphere was practically nonexistent, just a bunch of dudes and a few girls just sitting down, talking in small groups separated from each other or looking at their phones. I was even surprised and I thought I had arrived way too early, but turns out the party had already been going for like 3 hours. And the thing is, I know these people, and I know that they don‚Äôt listen to any EDM at all, so when I saw them while coming in I felt worried, but I didn‚Äôt make too much of it and said hi to everyone and had a few drinks and a few laughs. 

A couple hours later my friend asked me if I could start DJing and I said sure, thinking I might be able to maybe cheer everyone up. While setting up I started to feel a bit nervous (normal, it was my first gig after all), and as I started to DJ the people approached and some of them started dancing a bit but literally after like 2 or 3 songs most of them just walked away, I wondered if perhaps I started too strong as I opened with some light trance, but perhaps that was too much for them and I should‚Äôve started with some generic house instead. Either way, I tried for a much funkier direction instead (nu disco, funky house) but none of them came back, there were only like 4 dudes left who weren‚Äôt even dancing, just staring at the visuals on the screen (I think they were high). And then there were this two drunk assholes who would constantly approach and start ""cheering for me"" but like in a derisive way while also mocking the way ravers dance and then they would leave laughing, or they would approach me and start playing with the jog wheel or twisting the knobs without my permission basically fucking up my beatmatch. 

I reached the breaking point when two dudes just straight up started harassing me. One of them would constantly approach me telling me that I had been playing ""techno"" (it was house, but whatever) for like 3 hours (it had been ONE hour tops) and demanding me to play Hip Hop instead. The other one would just stand by my side and start telling me that he ""wasn‚Äôt feeling it"" and that I should play better stuff, or he would just stare at the computer screen and ask ""how much longer?"" or say ""you‚Äôre taking too long"". Everyone looked so fucking bored and I felt so pressured because I felt that maybe they weren‚Äôt having a good time because of me, like maybe I was forcing my music down their throats or something. At this point there was basically no one sticking around so I just unplugged everything and left the fucking party. 

I was so fucking angry and I felt extremely humiliated and embarrassed, and the thing that enraged me the most is that the birthday girl and the other 3 people who were asking me ""when are you gonna start DJing?"" the entire party just walked away after like 10 fucking minutes, so why did I even bother? Especially the birthday girl, she made me feel like a dancing monkey, a circus freak, a novelty to show to all of her friends that she can just throw away when she gets bored of it. I then felt extremely sad because when I got home I opened the IG story of a friend who stayed at the party and it looked like everyone was having a blast. It was like as soon as I left the party, they were finally able to play their Hip Hop music and have fun. I have to say that not everything was all that bad, the few actual close friends of mine that were at that party were actually enjoying themselves and dancing and asking me with real curiosity stuff about DJing or the controller or the software. 

So my first gig was a nightmare, and I‚Äôm left wondering what should I do. One the one hand I LOVE DJing, it‚Äôs my favourite pastime and my way to decompress and relax after a long day. I‚Äôve also considered having it as an actual job because I‚Äôm a producer and I think it would be a nice way to promote my music, and also because I love raves and because you can travel a lot with this job. On the other hand, I‚Äôm seriously questioning my abilities because maybe I‚Äôm not as good as I thought I was and maybe this job is just not for me, and also the thought of dealing with this bullshit every time (drunk assholes, song requesters, dead crowds) is just appalling, I‚Äôve always known that these are a DJ‚Äôs worst enemies (almost cliche) but having finally interacted with these people and these situations in the flesh felt way worse that I thought it would tbh. Also, what worries me is that this is a small town and word could quickly spread that maybe I‚Äôm a shitty DJ which could impact my career prospects (I don‚Äôt even live here anymore anyways but who knows, what if word reaches the town I‚Äôm currently living in?). Ugh, I don‚Äôt know what to make of all of this.

I‚Äôm sorry for this long ass rant, but I felt that if I didn‚Äôt get all of that out my head would explode. So what do you think guys? What should I do? Maybe next time I should prepare better and stick to a theme? I think I‚Äôve learned my lesson to NEVER DJ at a house party ever again unless its packed and I‚Äôm sure the assistants enjoy EDM.

Edit: Just to clarify some things for some people in the comments, I acknowledge I fucked up by not preparing beforehand, that was my mistake and I learned the lesson. To be fair though, the host knew I exclusively play edm (for the moment) and she said it was alright, that the guests would like that music, and I took her word for it. Also one of the reasons this didn‚Äôt work out is because the party was supposed to have more than 100 guests, and I guess she was expecting it to be like Project X or something, of course it didn‚Äôt go as planned. I‚Äôm not saying the audience was wrong and dumb and I was right and smart, they were right to be bored, it‚Äôs just that I didn‚Äôt have a good time during my first live performance, that‚Äôs all. Also, I‚Äôm a girl, not a guy :)"
792,Need help to pick the right kind of speakers for both playing venues/open air and production,0,DJs,13,"Hola,

So I am moving to Spain very soon for a while. I will be living in a 20 millon euro villa. My goal is to have a like a studio that faces the sea and pool to produce and also pratice/preparing sets.  

Since the place is so big I also would like to do private events for friends on the rooftop terrace. 

So any reccomendations for what two different options of speaker that could  be?

I really like ADAM for production - are  they good for a living room party djing also you think?

Another thing about rooftop speakers is that they need to be easy to carry down all the stairs and be possible to use at beach parties or smaller inndor venues.

ich wollte mich mal erkundigen, ob es DJs gibt, die mit ihrer T√§tigkeit Geld verdienen und gleichzeitig √ºber eine Agentur vermittelt werden. Da ich von Agenturen bislang keine R√ºckmeldung bekam, wollte ich es mal hier versuchen. 

Mein Frage bezieht sich auf die Struktur der Zusammenarbeit zwischen DJ und Agentur: Stelle ich mir das so vor, dass es Leute gibt, die sich als Freiberufler - falls man es durchbekommen hat - gemeldet, ein Kleingewerbe angemeldet oder welche Rechtsform, die einem passend erscheint, gemeldet haben und dann nur √ºber die Agentur(en) vermittelt werden und dieser dann einen prozentualen Abschlag zahlen? L√§sst man sich √ºber die Agentur vermitten und vermittelt sich zus√§tzlich in Eigenleistung? Oder ist man bei einer Agentur wie in einem Angestelltenverh√§ltnis und muss sich dann um nichts mehr k√ºmmern? Gibt es Erfahrungen f√ºr Abw√§gungen?

Hello dear community,

i wanted to ask about DJs that are earning money with their work and are simultaneously placed with an agency. I didn't receive responses from some angencies to date so i though i could try to find an answer here.

My question is about the cooperation between agency and DJ: Is it organised as if you registered your business - as a type of legal form that suits your expectations - and then are ""distributed"" by the agency / agencies exclusively and they keep a payment in advance? Or do you get ""distributed"" by the agency / agencies and simultaneously look for gigs by yourself? Or is it like a regulary employment at a company so that you don't have to worry about anything furthermore? Do you have any experiences for consideration?

I hope i could make you understand my issue and i'm thankful for every response :)"

799,"Rane 57, Cue slider makes no difference? (Issue with serato?)",2,DJs,34,"Hi, I just got back into djing after a break of 15 years. I‚Äôm all analogue, and picked up a Rane TTM 57 SL to play with. Everything works perfectly on it, but the cue slider seems to make no difference. It always outputs both PGM 1 & 2 equally, and it‚Äôs kind of annoying when trying to cue up / find the next track on a record. 

I wondered if there‚Äôs a setting on Serato (that I can no longer gain access to) that might be overriding the cue slider?

I have never used serato and can‚Äôt now with this mixer, but i feel like I must be missing something obvious that is overriding the cue slider? (I‚Äôve checked the ‚Äòmaster cue‚Äô is off. It still works and plays only the master output when selected)

Any ideas appreciated, thanks"
800,Quick Mixes,11,DJs,30,"So, sometimes, at home, I'm just doing a quick demo in a certain genre, for a specific venue or event. Or I'm just trying out a stack of new downloads or testing out some changes to my livestream setup - those mixes always turn out to be the most fun to play and, when I listen back the next day, the recordings are always my favorites - really fun to make and always super fun to listen to. I'm talking like 30 minutes where I'm just winging it, ripping through ten or more tracks in record time, not worried about letting them play out *at all*. Just mixing in the next one as soon as it feels even reasonably decent to do so (which is sometimes only like 30 seconds). Each track gets an absolute max of 3 minutes, including mix-in/out time, usually less. This applies to Deep House, Tech House, EBM, Disco, Bass, Glitch, Club/Party tracks, Jazzy Trip-Hop, Downtempo, Lounge, whatever, by the way.

I've never played a live set this way, I feel like I'm always out there kinda milking it for time, letting tracks play out, long-form (and sometimes feeling, and probably looking, a little bored), which is stupid because I always have 4+ hours of tracks I want to play for a 2-hour set and have to pick a short list. I guess, obviously, I should try ripping through more tracks, quicker and solve both problems at the same time.

As far as my experience can tell, it just feels totally fresh and funky and fun the entire time, both to perform and to listen back.

Does anybody else play this way, feel this way? I mean, *I know people do this*, just curious if anyone has a point of view or some experience to share or something.

Edit: Also, usually the really good ones come when my mindset is ""this is a throw-away"" recording that I have NO intention of sharing/posting. And then, for some reason, it's the best one I've done in weeks.

I've ordered the Reloop Flux (still waiting for it) and was thinking of using Serato, but I realize that mapping the X1 MK3 in Serato isn't as easy as I'd hoped. Mainly because I can't map the X1 to a virtual 4-band EQ without paying for Reloop's $10/month expansion, and because the X1 MK3 still doesn't seem to be supported in Native Instruments' Controller Editor.

So I'm thinking of going back to Traktor because it'd be easier for using the X1 and managing the digital part of my setup, but is Reloop Flux still a good buy in this case? Do I lose any of Reloop Flux's features by using it in Traktor in DVS?"

And then while I'm flowing around, construct a set in iTunes itself in a playlist - and then sync the playlist with the Rekordbox/iTunes sync.

831,"Hosting a DJ workshop for teens, I need hardware advice.",15,DJs,24,"Good evening fellow DJs. I‚Äôm looking for your advice.

I‚Äôm an italian Dj with almost 15 years of experience and more than a few gigs under my belt, but I‚Äôve never had to deal with something like this: a cultural non-profit organization recruited me in order to host a 10 lessons DJ workshop for teens starting at the end of this month.

We are expecting 5-10 teenagers to sign up for the course, ranging from 14 to 17 years old, without any DJing experience.

I've already started sketching down a basic course program for the 10 planned lessons, including vinyl vs digital mixing, a sprinkle of DJing history, the differences between mixing styles, and so on, but the thing I'm having trouble with is deciding what hardware the kids will be practicing on. 

I own a Pioneer RX2, which I'm planning to use as my theory-practice explanation device, using a projector in order to let all the class see what I'm doing. I am not entirely convinced about letting the students use my device, as there is a risk of damage, and the students would have to take turns practicing one at a time, leaving the rest of the class bored to death.

The best solution, in my opinion, would be getting a few all-in-ones the student can share in pairs, trying to stay on the budget side. Also, I'd love them to be standalone devices, without requiring computers/tablets/phones to control.

Is there any particular hardware model you can suggest me?
How many students should I group up for each device, taking turns practicing?

Thank you colleagues, you are the best.

EDIT: Some info I mistakingly left out: the non-profit organisation will be budgeting the event, hence I'm not on a specific budget but ""the cheaper the better"", you know..
The workshop will be free for the kids.
My go to choice would be using mixing hardware: I understand all the advantages of apps and mobile softwares, and by the way it may actually end up as my choice, but I think learning to beatmatch by ear is way more solid as a fundamental than beatmatching by looking at waveforms. 
Or, maybe, I'm just biased by the way I learnt the profession when I was just starting up."

840,I dunk on VR DJ‚Äôing but I may have seen the light,0,DJs,50,"So I‚Äôve been harsh on VR DJing in the past.

I still am not sold on VR _only_ DJing as a replacement to IRL partying, but I just saw this stupid TikTok using the Apple Vision Pro and the penny dropped for me. 

VR DJing will always be a niche thing, but AR in DJing is likely be huge someday. 

One of my biggest (and perhaps only) dislikes of digital DJing with laptop and controllers today is the song selection interface. 

Simply put, scrolling a list of words comes nowhere close to the physical, spatial, visual and tactile benefits of flipping through a record bag to find your next track. 

The combination of putting records that go well together next to each other (spatial), having an emotional or intuitive memory of a track triggered by the album colour or art (visual), and physical / tactile selection of 12‚Äù‚Äôs cannot be beat when it comes to song selection. 

I‚Äôve imagined physical ways of reproducing this in the past through some kind of rotating midi drum and screen combo (cc u/rutierut) but nothing really stuck. 

Now.. watch that video and imagine having a physical record box full of blank cardboard 12‚Äù sleeves, with QR codes or fiducial markers on them. Instead of seeing code, you have a Vision Pro or cheaper, next gen equivalent headset on which  displays album art on it. And instead of taking the record out of the sleeve, you just select it and it cues up in your digital player of choice. 

Infinite access to your digital crates, all the benefits of 12‚Äù record sleeves and organisation, but none of the downsides of lugging actual vinyl. 

I never saw an immediate use case for VR in DJing, but I would absolutely pay for something like this. 

Virtual controllers and mixers are still useless in my opinion, but a hybrid AR/physical library browser and an IRL mixer set up would be an absolute delight for me."

852,How to successfully promote events without enough of a starting base of supporters?,2,DJs,24,"I'm sure someone may have already gone through this so I thought I'd ask here.

I'm trying to run my own events and build up a fan base. Now I'm a co admin of an fb with 60K followers, 18% of those people are in my city, so that's about 11 thousand people right there. It's a Nostalgia FB page and thought I might celebrate the amount of followers by throwing a party. So I hired a boat weeks ago and now there's a few days left and I've sold maybe 40 out of the 150 tickets I was supposed to. They say most people would buy tickets at the last minute but I'm obviously worried so now I'm trying to figure out what I can do to get a last minute boost in tickets. I don't care about the money even, so long as I can just pull a decent crowd.

The whole with promoting is most of the people you'd bring are closely related to you or people you've already interacted with, but I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to convert people and if there's any way I can push tickets without that.

What I really want is that turning point where I start getting more notice as a DJ and my mean starts meaning more but that comes with time, getting a break or some kind of opportunity that takes me to the next level where followers start building up. That's the stage I can't fully get to at the moment.

853,Are DJ reviewers compromised (Omnis-Duo),75,DJs,192,"I tend to watch YouTube reviews of certain controllers to hear their honest opinion on everything that drops and for the most part, reviewers are pretty good on that.

Here is my issue, both Denon Prime Go and MixStream pro are both stand alone units with far more features and the reviewers gave their honest opinions. They said what they liked and disliked, but with the Omnis-Duo nothing but praise.

Still working on the exact mechanics, but the general idea would be to give the AI access to your music libraries and let it learn what you like to play (possibly even what you've played in past sets) in addition to several inputs (e.g. moods, location, etc.) and it would output graphics in the form of GIFs and short videos you can control with a small touch screen.

Throwaway account.

I think I need a bit of a reality check to see if i‚Äôm justified at being mad at my local clubs or if i‚Äôm being ridiculous.

For context:
Club A (biggest club in my city) i‚Äôve been speaking with since October. The manager there originally said they would get me on within two weeks, but they never open my messages on insta. Every time i go into the club to speak to the manager they act all friendly and just say it‚Äôs been busy but they‚Äôll get me a gig within the month. Obviously this hasn‚Äôt happened and I feel like i‚Äôm just being strung along.

Club B recently opened within the past few months. I‚Äôve been emailing them and they were pretty keen to get me in to play and i‚Äôve even played there once. They originally said my music was too fast for them (they were playing house and I played techno) and asked if i could change up the vibe. I agreed and sent them a house mix. They then stopped replying and i‚Äôve heard nothing even after multiple follow-ups. This week I see that they‚Äôre now playing techno which has annoyed me a little after asking me to change and then ghosting me.

Also, just for more context, i have a small following and DJ regularly at Club C (2nd biggest club in my city) usually as headlining/closing act might I add.

I'm currently using a XDJ RX standalone controller + a turntable that I connect to the XDJ in phono (I switch between deck and phono depending on whether I'm transitioning to a digital track or vinyl)

\- I'd like to mix with 4 channels (xdj rx only has 2 channels)

\- I'd like to have a more club-oriented workflow and therefore practice on CDJ

Ive found a pair of CDJ 900 nexus in my city, in superb condition (almost new) sold for 1500 euros. To that I'll add a Xone 43c mixer for ‚Ç¨500. Im pretty sure i can sell the XDJ RX1 + the magma flight case for around 1100‚Ç¨.

I wanted to know if you think its interesting to switch from XDJ RX1 to CDJ 900 nexus + xone 43c set up.

Also, what do you think of these CDJs (apart from the fact that they have no hot cues) and in general, do you think the money invested is worth it? (1500 + 500 - 1100 = 900‚Ç¨ cost for the transition)

I recently bought the Numark M6 USB mixer for my studio to replace my old and used DJM 800.
I was aware, that the M6 doesn't have any FX Unit, but as I love to use FXs, I'm trying to figure out a solution/workaround.

I'm using the Traktor DJ software and connect my computer with the mixer through the Traktor A6 Scratch device.
On this interface, you have a specific output channel, which you can use for FX Send. (There's an official documentation about it)

The idea would be to connect this channel with one of the 4 main Line In of the mixer, through a RCA cable.
Therefore, is it possible to use one of the 4 main channels on the M6 to receive the FX signal, and use it so?
And can I use it without to setup any FX Return? (as it's no use for me)
Or do you know any other way around?

Today I'm coming here looking for advice on how much to charge for a gig.  I'm in northern Minnesota, and this gig was in a local rural town.  I gave about 10-11 hours total of my time for the gig between prep, setup/breakdown, and the event itself.  I ran music for a few hours, did some emceeing, and also co-hosted a live auction and raffles.  I didn't end up doing all of the emceeing, because one of the presenters wanted someone else to introduce him, so we tag teamed it.

My time is valuable.  I realize that more as I get older (I'm 26), but at the same time, I don't want to overcharge for something that didn't end up completely being my gig in the end even though I provided the equipment and curated the music.

For an emcee gig with music like this, how much do you charge?  Per hour, or flat rate?  Does ending up with a co-emcee who's not connected to you and your service change things for you at all?  These answers that end up on this post will help shape what I charge going forward, so thank you for your time!"

888,Is KIT 850 or CDJ850+DJM450 better?,0,DJs,2,"Hi guys, I'm not sure to buy an 850 kit (CDJ's 850 and DJM850 mixer). 

Mainly to record sets at home and rent them to events and nightclubs in the region. I'm from Minas Gerais - Brazil. 

A kit like this is going for 11.699$ BRL here (this is the value of used equipment), it is complicated to find this new equipment here.

 I wanted to get the DJM-750MK2 mixer but the value is 15.000$ BRL just for the mixer, what do you think? What's more worthwhile?

I also wanted to use the pair of CDJ850 with the DJM-450 mixer but I think the visual is a bit rough, even for renting the set is ugly, two large CDJ's with a small mixer in the middle, it looks weird. 

But which would be better kit 850 or DJM450+CDJ850? Thanks"

892,Alto ts415 PA speaker hiss from horn,0,DJs,6,"I originally bought the alto ts415 powered PA speaker and upon testing it I noticed a small hiss from the horn once powered on and then a couple seconds later it got a little bit louder. It‚Äôs as if once the Bluetooth fully initializes it gets louder so I think it‚Äôs coming from the module but this is the second speaker brand new that is happening on. I then had the speaker replaced and the same thing as happening. Anyone have any experience with this or understand why this might be happening? My thoughts are that it might be bad Bluetooth implementation.

I‚Äôve tried a couple search protectors in a couple different outlets in my house and I have also tried plugging the speaker directly into different outlets in my house but I haven‚Äôt taken the speaker to a different house in order to rule out a possible dirty ground in my home. However, I have a few other monitor speakers that don‚Äôt do this."

However I am not super excited and was expecting better sound quality with the equipment I have. I'm running it into a Soundcraftsman A5002 amplifier and EV SH15-2 speakers. We are streaming audio and I have also played a few songs off of CD's but the system just does not seem to put out the sound I expected with either one. We are using it in a really large venue (the roller skating rink where I volunteer) Does anyone have an opinion on the Vestax preamp on sound quality? I may take in my Soundcraftsmen preamp and play a few songs without using the Vestax and see if there is much difference. I am new to the dj thing and appreciate everyone's thoughts. Thanks.

As a former DJ I had all my own equipments and never rent. Just wanted to know if that‚Äôs a common thing with DJs now. Oh and it‚Äôs mostly the newer active qsc and Ev top/sub. 

Update : Thank you my fellow djs and anyone who offered their advice . That‚Äôs why I love Reddit , if you‚Äôre second guessing something you can come on here and get answers directly from the horses mouth. I decided I‚Äôm going to rent these since they are the newer speakers and will go legit with a LLC , contracts etc I will also offer delivery service for an extra $ and I will add more high end equipment to my collection if it goes well. I will turn down the offer I got from marketplace and remove the ad.

899,Any other DJs out there who don't really care about playing live anymore?,132,DJs,194,"Hi all! Quick bit of background before getting into the question. I started DJing in 1999 and quit in 2008. Most of my gigs during that time were at afterparties, fetish parties and the occasional club appearance.

After a 15 year break, I decided to start up again at the ripe old age of 50, because I love the music and missed being creative, but I'm happy with just posting my mixes on my Soundcloud page. I really don't care about playing live anymore as I would rather work on my DJ and production skills (which I also started a year ago), than trying to hustle and promote myself in order to get gigs in the small city I moved to in 2022. I also find that this has freed me from dancefloor centric music. I've been branching out into ambient, downtempo and electronica which I would imagine isn't super marketable , especially in my neck of Upstate NY.

Just wondering if there are any other DJs out there who don't care about performing in front of a crowd.  


edit: Another reason I'm not into the whole club thing is that I have mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears above 2k Hz and I would like to preserve what hearing I have left."

I neglected to ensure that my visa was taken care of, and I got pushed back 24 hours while I waited to get approved. Good thing I was trying to get to the city a day before my booking, but after paying to get an express visa, immigration document costs, paying to change my flight, losing my travel expenses to and from the airport the first time, I'm pretty in the red on accepting this gig. Not to mention I neglected to bring a secondary backpack, so when the bag I intended to carry on was overweight I had to check the whole thing, including my laptop and USBs. I'm spending this whole flight praying everything arrives safely and I don't wind up with busted essential equipment, not to mention the wasted time I am staring out the window at the ocean instead of working on my set or my productions in Ableton.

Does anyone have an international DJ checklist that can help prevent bungles like this going forward? I feel like I could really use the advice going forward so I don't wind up caught with my pants down again!"

903,DJM-450: Sound color fx issues,0,DJs,1,"Fellow DJs and gear enthusiasts.

I bought a (new) Pioneer DJM-450 mixer around christmas. Now, the left sound color fx channel/knob is behaving weirdly:

Moving the knob just slightly (like 5%) renders a full effect of the FX (100%). Moving it a bit further, it kind of ‚Äùjumps back‚Äù to it‚Äôs normal level. 

This creates a ‚Äùhole‚Äù in the sound when using the left fx, and sounds fucked up in mixtapes.

Not talking about the woodblocky deep house / guru house / atmospheric / hippie stuff you can find anywhere (e.g. Anjunadeep, All Day I Dream, Kindisch); more of the edgier, like... imagine a ""deep desert psy house"" sound, low 120's BPM, with strong currents of syncopated percussive melodies. Have scoured ""melodic house & techno"" tracks all over Beatport, ZipDJ, Bandcamp and Soundcloud to no avail, even though intuitively that seems like the right place to dig.

My father used to be a DJ in his 20s, and a few years ago he bought some old Pioneer CDJ 200s (I believe). 

However the old collection of cds he had have since burnt out and he is not too technically savy to replace them.

Where do I source songs and samples, and what is the proper approach to organising the music into cds? I.e. based on style,bpm or length. How many tracks per cd?

I would also like to get him a new set of headphones preferably a ¬£100 or under.

What do you do with those tracks that never make it to banger or iconic status? Do you keep them or toss them out?

Fillers do have a purpose. Many of them copy a sound that works and just rearrange the melodies etc. They allow us to split the bangers and hits up and time their release. Many fillers are solid tracks, they just dont stand out from the crowd or scream 'keep me'. "

914,The OMNIS-DUO is targeted for trust fund kids who casually DJ for TikTok.,285,DJs,234,"I said what I said lol

The price is ridiculous for what it does. They copied what Denon GO did three years ago but slapped their label on it and made it way more expensive. The only benefits are portability, ease of setting up, and ‚Äúaesthetic.‚Äù The controls look terrible, sliders are so small, and it‚Äôs missing some key features for professional performance. The battery only lasts 5 hours. It‚Äôs not truly ‚Äúwireless‚Äù you have to RCA into a chunky AlphaTheta receiver (which they list nothing about in the website, I literally can‚Äôt tell anywhere if it‚Äôs included with the product)  The USB input on the back hurts my soul, and don‚Äôt get me started on the ‚ÄúBluetooth audio input enables the crowd to join‚Äù lmao 

The problem is, no one taking DJing seriously would invest in this. This is not for clubs, promoters, or anyone in industry. And no one casually DJing would pay that much for a toy like this‚Ä¶ unless they had disposable income. Nobody asked for this. If they wanted the rebrand to be taken seriously, they should‚Äôve come out with a more serious product. 

You‚Äôre gonna see content creators doing short form videos playing Losing It at the Eiffel Tower or Badadan in a fucking bodega on this thing. 

And don‚Äôt get me started on the speaker -_-

Wondering how the new elara.4 compares to Mastersounds/Condesa/ARS/Varia/E&S/A&H Xone 96 in terms of sound quality. Obviously the Mastersounds Valve 2V/4V Mk2 will have slightly different sound characteristics due to the tubes, but am I right in thinking that tubes and faders aside, the MS Valve and UA elara.4 are essentially the same mixer? FWIW I already have the Mastersounds FX which would pair perfectly with the elara.4 (or MS Valve 2V/4V).

Other contenders are ARS Model 1100 and the Can Electric Taula MR...

This last week, my stepmother passed away. We weren't too terribly close, but this is still quite a task to deal with. My father rented out a large space and we're expecting hundreds of people to show up (She was a very popular gal) . This isn't going to be a standard funeral, but more so a celebration of life with an emphasis on making this a party. We want to have a good time, not be sad. A family member will be there and will be DJing for a few hours. After that he has a different gig, and then I have to be the DJ for the remaining 4 hours. My step mother always wanted to see me play but never got the chance so this is in my opinion something she would have wanted me to do. I however am primarily an EDM DJ...

My concerns are that obviously a lot of electronic styles of music aren't suitable for this type of event/crowd. I now have 5 days to prepare music for this. My step mother was in her 40's and I would imagine a huge range of age and demographics in the audience. Another note is that we live in a somewhat rural area and you see a lot of folk listening to country and rock, which I am very uneducated about. 

So what should I do as to not disrespect my stepmother and not offend anyone attending? I figured greatest hits of the 70's 80's and 90's but It seems overwhelming to somehow acquire all this music. I am starting to panic. It wasn't even as if I could have declined to offer to DJ. That would have been very rude. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions."

49,Vinyl fetishism is bullshit,518,DJs,300,"In response to this poor guy having an existential crisis because people are shaming him into using vinyl, I just wanted to say, **vinyl fetishism is pure bullshit.**

- You don‚Äôt need to play vinyl to be a real DJ. 
- You don‚Äôt need top of the line gear to be a real DJ. 
- You don‚Äôt need a million followers to be a real DJ. 
- You don‚Äôt need to play EDM to be a real DJ. 
- You don‚Äôt need to be attractive, wear certain clothes, or look a certain way to be a real DJ. 
- You certainly don‚Äôt need Pioneer CDJs to be a real DJ. 

Yes, vinyl sounds better _sometimes_. Crate digging is fun _sometimes_. The look and feel of a 12‚Äù sleeve and a record is satisfying _sometimes_. But there are also a million downsides to vinyl as well, all of which means preferring vinyl is a personal choice if you‚Äôre wealthy and obsessive. It has NOTHING to do with being a quality DJ or knowing how to rock a dance floor. 

Being able to beatmatch by ear is a fantastic and very helpful skill. That should be essential no matter what medium you‚Äôre using, but let‚Äôs be honest, even _that_ isn‚Äôt necessary for a lot of people. 

Being into vinyl as a passion is 100% fine, but buying into the whole ‚Äúvinyl only‚Äù culture _to the exclusion or judgment of others_ is cowardly and insecure. 

I‚Äôll just say it. Nothing says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an insecure elitist who isn‚Äôt confident enough in my skills or self worth to stand on my own, so I have to hide behind my wallet and my false sense of pride‚Äù than insisting you have to play vinyl to be a real DJ. 

Don‚Äôt fall for it. It‚Äôs bullshit. Do your thing, rock your sound, make people happy, keep dancing. You don‚Äôt need vinyl.

A while back I released my VJ website [shapiro500.com](https://shapiro500.com) where you can play all my looping visuals in-browser as an easy way to throw up some visuals for a show. I first posted it here a few years ago, and just recently updated it to include some of the suggestions you had when I first released it.

* You can now tempo match the visuals to your music by tapping the spacebar
* You can download them all in 1080p instead of just 720p
* You can download one by one OR a zip file of all \~70 videos
* You can set the duration of each vid to a certain amount of beats

Let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions. You can use these for free in concerts, events, livestreams, or any kind of performance.

100,Gig from hell last night,417,DJs,107,"Booked a graduation party for last night.  I had played a graduation party there last year and it was a rager.  The family is pretty well off - country well off.  I set up in a tent with a dance floor in their back yard.

Anyway, got to the gig and started.  The dance floor was packed - 200 people from all over in the tent. One dude comes up and stands by me, clearly wants to talk.   He tells me he's a DJ and asks if he can use the mic if I'm not so he can do his thing.  I say no, of course.  Then he wants to looks at all my music.  I asked him if he used Serato - he had no idea what that was.  I turn my back to grab something out of my bag and he gets on my mic and starts talking in some stupid voice saying stupid shit. I tell  him to get the fuck out and don't touch my shit.  He says he has 3 million followers on TikTok.  I ask him ""What the fuck is TikTok?""  (I'm 50, he was maybe 19)

Someone throws a beer a little I while after that, I get on the mic and chew the asshole out.  So things are going pretty good.  Then the drama starts.

One of the daughters asks me to make an announcement.  There are so many cars that they were parking on the rural highway blocking the road.  The dad wants me to stop playing until cars are moved.  So I stop and make the announcement.  And wait.

10 minutes later the dad comes up to me and says ""Party's over, go home"".  So I start to shut down.

The mom, who hired me and had already paid me, comes into the tent and tells me to start back up, ""You're playing until 1!!""  She's pretty drunk by this point, but I do it anyway.

Another 10 minutes and the dad comes in and says ""I'm the boss, shut it down, party's over, everyone go home.""  So I just stop the music and have a seat.  Mom is going to show back up, soon.

She does, and proceeds to chew me out.  I told her she needed to get with her husband and decide what was going to happen before I started playing again.  She gets hot, pulls the ""who's name is on the check"" card and tell me to start playing.  All right, this roller coaster is moving again, music is back on.  She waited for him at the entrance to the tent.  I figured there was going to be domestic violence at this point.  I tried to think of a song for the forthcoming altercation, so I cued up the Rocky theme (Gonna Fly Now) waiting for the fireworks.

I get two songs in and BOOM, the power goes off in the tent.  Dad pulled the plug.  My laptop is the only thing in the tent with juice.  I figure it's really over this time so I start to pack up.  I'm pissed, because sudden power loss can ruin equipment. (Everything checked out OK)

The dad comes up while I'm tearing down and apologizes for the scene and makes sure she paid me.  I pack up and go home.

What. The. Actual. Fuck?

In retrospect, was there a better song I could have cued up for the potential donnybrook between husband and wife?

Edit: just thought of it: Mama said knock you out by LL Cool J. "

102,Stop taking gigs you don‚Äôt have music for,410,DJs,179,"There have been serval posts recently from people accepting gigs in genres and styles they aren‚Äôt familiar with. 

The posts usually go like this:

‚ÄúHey guys, I got a big gig in a genre I am totally unfamiliar with and it starts in 3 hours. What should I play?‚Äù

You‚Äôre NUMBER ONE JOB as a DJ is to know and curate a lot of music, preferably music both you and your crowd love.

Why in the hell would you take a gig you don‚Äôt have the material for?

Would you agree to fix someone‚Äôs car without tools? Cook a meal without having ingredients? Teach a class in a language you don‚Äôt understand? Of course not.

If you get offered a gig for which you don‚Äôt have music, DO NOT ACCEPT IT.

**Stop taking gigs you‚Äôre not prepared for!**

Seriously, this is like Life 101, not to mention DJing 101. 

/crazypills.gif

EDIT - to clarify, I whole heartedly support experimenting with new genres. I play all sorts of genres and encourage all DJs to step outside their comfort zone and try new sounds.

DJs should take gigs in new scenes, experiment with new genres and create new mixing techniques.

All I am saying is fucking prepare for it. Do your homework and be ready. Don‚Äôt expect anyone else to tell you your style, what you should play, or even think about accept a gig until you have a sense for the genre and a decent playlist that you know how to use."

https://reddit.com/r/DJs/s/5uzjcrBxoV

Yeah groom was trippin..

Aight so first off, I do not know what led to the breakup. The planner didn‚Äôt know and I wasn‚Äôt going to ask around lol.

 What I do know is.. this was in no way shape or form a ‚Äúnightmare gig‚Äù the bride showed up and she looked amazing. She wore a skin tight all white sparkle dress (not her wedding dress) and a huge smile on her face. Her whole family was fitted head to toe, they all looked good and were ready for a good time. 

As far as the actual music went, this was some of the most fun I had as a DJ. I took the advice from a lot of you all on here and took requests. A large portion of her family flew in from Colombia, so I learned some new songs. About 45min in, the bride disappeared for a bit and had her ‚Äúmoment‚Äù, but  her family was so hype and supportive of her that she was able to mentally escape and enjoy the rest of her night. 

A couple highlights 

- Started pouring rain right as dad started his toast, and one single rumble of thunder happened exactly after he said ‚ÄúI know my baby will always be protected by God‚Äù then it stopped and a rainbow came out and the bride took pics in front of it. (I know it all sounds like bs that only happens in a movie, but I promise it did)

- Bride‚Äôs family all brought props/hats to party and dance with and they all got used 

- I danced salsa with the bride and didn‚Äôt step on her feet üòÇ

- huge pop for the Macarena üòÇ

- my ‚ÄúLatin‚Äù crate has some shiny new gems 

- I got invited to play in Italy üòÇ

- tip envelope was heavy 

When all was said and done, everyone sweated out their problems and had a great night. The bride has a very strong support system and I think she‚Äôll be just fine. I truly do applaud the grace she showed, I can only imagine the emotional roller coaster she‚Äôs been riding.

Thanks again for all of the input, suggestions, advice & luck this community provided prior to this gig.

107,Arrogant amateur DJ's view of Commercial DJ's: A rant (A long rant),404,DJs,208,"I've spent the last couple of years quietly building up a rage within me after reading and engaging with hundreds of ludicrous posts and comments on Reddit, Facebook, Intagram & even my Whatsapp chats. I'm a difficult person to wind up, but all these collective minor frustrations have lead me to the tipping point where I desperately need to vent.

Now let me start by clarifying, I don't have a probelm with most amateur DJ's, after all that's where we all started. I do however have a big problem with amateur DJ's that don't know their place.

I get it okay, you've watched a few videos, read a few articles, surfed Reddit for a few weeks and come to the following conclusions:

1. You should probably only buy plain black t-shirts from now on
2. Sync is for people who aren't real DJ's
3. Open-format DJ's are sellouts who don't care about DJing
4. You possibly have the best music taste the world has ever seen, and you're definitely going to go global with your very unique selection of minimal techno

One thing that winds me up the most is their misconception of Open Format DJ's, especially because we make up such a large part of the DJ scene. This idea that we only play the top 40 songs to a crowd full of casuals who don't care about REAL music like you do. 

Before I get into the real lack of logic with that very commonly held view, let me expose you to a simple truth: Unless you are producing music in the genre you love, you're going to find it hard to make money. Sure, you may do plenty of events and have a lot of fun, but it's very unlikely that you'll make a living that way, and therein lies the probelm for those of us that want to do this for a full time job.

If we don't DJ a wide scope of popular music, we won't be getting 3/4 gigs a week paying a living wage, because the demand just isn't there for our niche. I don't think many of you realise that most Open Format DJ's do have a favourite genre, often an underground dance genre, but we've realised that we won't make a living out of that, and we do NOT want an office job. 

Now the main problem: The idea that what we do is easy, and what you do is hard, when in reality it's the total fucking opposite. So you're passionate about Techno and you're adamant that you're only going to play Techno events because Techno is REAL music, right? You're gonna turn up to a Techno event, with a USB full of Techno, and play Techno to a crowd of people that love Techno. It is almost impossible to fuck that up. Don't get me wrong, there will be some minor scope for error in terms of mixing and energy, but other than that, it's an absolute open goal, you know what the people want and you give it to them. 

Open Format DJ's have it easy, right? Just load up the top 40 and play them, simple. Except that notion couldn't be any further from reality. When we turn up to the club, we haven't got any idea what's going to happen that night. We don't know anything about our incoming audience, it could be any number of people from any demographic with any taste in music, and it's our responsibility to figure that shit out as quickly as possible to make sure people stay in the venue.

What if it's a commercial crowd, or a House crowd, or a Latino crowd? What if it's an office night out? What if it's a hen party? What if it's an older crowd? It could literally be anything or anyone. 

I have a solid library of about 15,000 high quality songs across many different genres, and I need to know them inside out, because I can't create a playlist for the night before it starts. I have to be able to adapt and weave between genres seamlessly when needed and be able to raise the energy of the dancefloor from stone cold to jumping up and down. 

*""But I like to show people music they've never heard before and take them on a journey, I'm so much better than all of you""*. Do you think people need new music to be taken on a journey? I can take people from chilled vibing and dancing slow to jumping up and down - singing in absolute euphoria, I don't need some dirty bass house drop they've never heard before to achieve that, I just need to push the right buttons in their brains. The nostalgia you can make people feel playing throwbacks from their childhood & the way you can control their emotions with the vibe of the music is an incredible power to have. 

The scope for error is HUGE, there are so many different ways to fuck that up, so many different ways to clear the dancefloor. And that's why, despite the fact that Open-Format DJ's often have a massive crossover in what music they play, there is still a hierarchy. I know a shit tonne of DJ's like me, some who aren't as good and some who are much better, because there is a lot of scope for creativity and the learning curve is endless. I've played almost 500 nights in the last 4 years, and I'm still learning something every single night.

So a word of advice to some of the Arrogant, probably slightly insecure amateur DJ's I see all over internet: Stop bashing commercial DJ's because you think they're not real DJ's, you barely know anything about the scene and it doesn't make you look cool, serious and professional, it instantly points you out as a newbie. 

Real DJ's have respect for the craft in all it's forms, and they mind their own business.

108,I made a site for DJs who want to quickly add tempo-matched visuals to their shows,405,DJs,53,"Hey guys,

I made a site that you can just load up and have party visuals for your show.  It loops randomly through a bunch of VJ clips that I've made, and you can adjust the tempo to match your set.  Thought it would be a fun tool to have for people who want to easily add some visuals to a screen during an event, but don't have a VJ with them, and don't want to deal with youtube playlists.  Also you can Chromecast it to a TV if you can't plug in for some reason. 

Let me know if you have any suggestions!  I don't make money from this, it's just a passion project.

140,"My ultimate track tagging system, the ‚ÄúLittle Data, Lotta Love‚Äù approach",369,DJs,65,"Hey guys, 

Every few weeks there is a conversation about ‚Äúwhat is the best way to tag your music?‚Äù or ‚Äúhow do I build a set?‚Äù

One common response is to tell people to sort by genre, key, BPM, and time of night / energy level.

This approach isn‚Äôt very helpful, especially for DJ‚Äôs just starting out. I‚Äôve got an active collection of about 1,600 songs which I‚Äôve collected over the last 20 years. It‚Äôs impossible to remember every single track. It‚Äôs also impossible to plan long sets, and planning sets sucks anyway.

So I developed what I call **‚ÄúThe Little Data, Lotta Love Tagging System‚Äù**.

**TL;DR: Tag the heck out of your tracks so you can use search to create instant playlists on the fly.**

**Summary:**

Here is how it work in summary. TAG EVERY TRACK SIX WAYS TO SUNDAY. Most tracks barely use all the variables which MP3 allows you to write. Usually they just include information on the artist, track name, release date, etc.

Instead of just using boring Genre, BPM, rating stars, and so on, use all the other columns that MP3‚Äôs offer in order to add lots and lots of descriptive information. This could be the vibe, the instruments, the complexity, the intensity, how it makes you feel, the taste it leaves in your mouth, where you heard it first, whatever. The more tags you give it, the more helpful the system becomes.

Once you‚Äôve tagged your tracks with this level of detail, you can do two amazing things. First, create smart playlists in iTunes, RB, Serato, etc. for any combination of moods, venues, or parties you like. You just create a rule in iTunes and it automatically refreshes the tracks in there. They‚Äôre always there without having to rebuild the playlist and new tracks get automatically added if they fit. 

Second, and this is where the real magic happens, you can instantly create dynamic playlists in real time for any mood or moment just using the search bar. For example, you might remember the feeling of that ‚Äúbanging acid afro track with the sick grinding bass line from about 2 months ago‚Äù, but you might not be able to remember what the name of it was or who was the artist. No problem! Just type for ‚Äúbanging acid afro track grinding‚Äù and sort by date and you‚Äôve got it! Same for key matching, BPM, etc.

I call this approach ‚ÄúLittle Data, Lotta Love‚Äù because it lets you DJ with feeling and spontaneity even if you have thousands of tracks and can‚Äôt remember them all. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúbig data‚Äù because you‚Äôre not searching millions of variables on millions of tracks. But it still uses a data driven approach which unlocks tons of freedom and creativity. Adding a ‚Äúlittle bit of data‚Äù as soon as you add the track gives you a ‚Äúwhole lotta love‚Äù later when you‚Äôre performing live. 

**More Detail:**

Here is how it works in detail. You should use your own tags and variables (or steal mine), but the process will be the same either way.

When I get a batch of new songs, I first load them into a custom instance of Foobar 2000 (running on Wine on my Mac). Foobar is great because it lets you create your own custom tags with a very efficient workflow. The version I use is adapted from /u/BasCurtiz (thanks Bas!), who describes how to create a custom workflow here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaMbf268BL0). You can create your own version following his method. But seriously, hats off to /u/BasCurtiz for bringing such an amazing system into the world. None of this approach would be as easy as it is without his Foobar 2000 scripting work.

Once you set up Foobar to quickly tag a lot tracks, follow these steps:

1. Tag for overall ‚ÄúRating‚Äù. I give all my tracks a 1 star (for interesting but not frequently played), 3 stars (for a good, regular track) or 5 stars (for special, high energy tracks that I love). I used to be more precise with my star rating system, but could never remember the difference between a 3 and a 4 star track, so this is easier for me and works with /u/BasCurtiz‚Äôs default tagging system. This rating gets stored in the track‚Äôs ‚Äústar‚Äù tag. 

2. Tag for ‚ÄúGenre‚Äù, which for me doubles as a ‚Äúset time‚Äù indicator for house and techno as well as a more general genre tag. Each track gets tagged as:

- Start
- Build
- Peak
- Sustain
- Release
- Hip Hop
- Party Breaks
- Dub / Reaggae
- Jungle
- Funk / Disco

This is helpful because although I play deep house most of the time, I also play funk, hip hop, breaks, etc. at different venues or at different times of night. Doubling the tag values like this lets me search by genre in general, or by a specific energy if I‚Äôm playing house or techno sets.

3. Tag by ‚ÄúMood‚Äù, which I save in the ‚ÄúRelease‚Äù tag. This includes:

- Happy
- Aggressive
- Dark
- Floating / Dreamy
- Emotional / Introspective

4. Next, I tag by ‚ÄúVibes‚Äù, which goes in the ‚ÄúComments‚Äù tag and is based on the following tags. They might not mean anything to you but the point is to use the tags that you find helpful to describe your music.

- Acid
- Afro
- Arabic
- Arpeggiated
- Asian
- Beats
- Bouncy
- Broken
- Classic
- Dirty
- Disco
- Dope
- Dreamy
- Driving
- Dubby
- Electro
- Epic
- Fun
- Funky
- Glitchy
- Goofy
- Grindy
- Head nodding
- Jazzy
- Joyful
- Latin
- Loopy
- Melodic
- Poppy
- Punchy
- Sosig
- Soulful / Musical
- Spiritual
- Swung
- Techy
- Tropical
- Weird

This might seem like a lot, but a vibe can apply to all genres and moods of music. You could have a ‚Äúmiddle energy, starting, hip hop, happy‚Äù track that is also ‚ÄúGlitchy, dirty, broken, and poppy‚Äù. It will sound totally different than a ‚Äúhigh energy, peak time, party breaks, aggressive‚Äù track which has those same vibes. Make sure to tag every track with *as many tags as you want to describe it.* This is key, because it unlocks the power of magic searching later on.

Also, these tags might not mean anything to you, so use whatever tags you use to describe your own music in the vocabulary that makes sense to you. It could be ‚Äúfire, banging, crunchy, etc.‚Äù, but make the descriptions about the *qualities* of the track, not your *opinion of it*.

5. Next, tag for what kind of instruments the track features most prominently, including the kind of bass line, the type of vocals, etc. This also gets written into the ‚ÄúComment‚Äù section, appended to the end of the Vibes tags. ‚ÄúInstruments‚Äù includes:

- Hi Hats
- Horns
- Piano
- Organ
- Strings
- Congas
- Sweeps
- Pads
- Guitar
- WalkingBass
- GrindyBass
- BoomingBass
- Spoken Word
- Chanting
- Singing
- Rap
- Acapella

6. Finally, save all the changes you‚Äôve made, throw the tracks in Mixed in Key to analyze the BPM and key of each track, and then import them to your DJ software of choice. I use Traktor but anything will do. 

Bonus: Occasionally I might even add a descriptive edit to the title of the track itself to help me remember something more specific, but that is always free form and is just there to jog my memory. Something like ‚ÄúCRAZY PEAK TIME RICHIE HAWTIN VIBE‚Äù or anything just as a further descriptive reminder.

**Magic Playlists:‚Äù

Once you prep you tracks this way, you become like a Track Management God.

Here‚Äôs an example of how it use it, with screen shots.

SCREEN SHOTS: https://imgur.com/0fxso1l

Lets say you‚Äôre playing Track A, which is the attached screen shots is ‚ÄúNgeke (Andhim Remix)‚Äù. In my system it‚Äôs tagged as a ‚ÄúBuilding‚Äù track that is ‚ÄúFloating / Spacey‚Äù and is ‚ÄúAfro, Arpeggiated, Dirty, Electro‚Äù that features ‚ÄúCongas, Sweeps, Pads, and Chanting‚Äù. 

What do you play next? First, I check the tags of the track that is playing (Step 1 in the screen shots). 

Since I‚Äôm feeling the dirty afro vibe, I type in ‚Äúafro dirty conga‚Äù in Traktor‚Äôs search bar and get a handful of tracks that are also ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù. (Step 2 in the screen shots) Now my options have gone from 1,600 tracks to just 6 tracks that match these tags. 

I see a killer Fela Kuti re-edit from Lego that matches those tags, but also is ‚Äúbroken, driving, epic, funky‚Äù and more. It‚Äôs also in the same key and close enough in BPM.
I cue it up and give it a listen and hot damn it sounds awesome. Mix it in and you‚Äôre grooving. (Steps 3 and 4)

Now we‚Äôre a little into the ‚Äúfunky‚Äù and ‚Äúbreakbeat‚Äù side of things, so I change my search to ‚Äúfunky, conga, broken‚Äù and get a different sub-set of tracks that have similar instruments and vibes. Oh yeah, I forgot about that sick Goldboy track that is really fun and joyful, with a great funk bass line and breakbeat.  It‚Äôs tagged as ‚ÄúBeats, broken, disco, head nodding, jazzy, and soulful‚Äù, with a slightly different but still similar set of main instruments.

Cue it up and fire!!! It‚Äôs a perfect mix. I dropped the key down 2 semi tones, which normally would bring the energy level down, but now that I‚Äôm in a related but slightly different musical space (with more funky breaks, a walking bass line and a disco loop) it still feels fresh and energetic. The crowd is loving the new direction I‚Äôm going, I‚Äôve got plenty of inspiration, and can work this groove as long as I feel like it, make a slight change, or switch it up entirely if I feel like taking a left turn in a few songs.

**Let the Music Move You:**

I read an interview years ago with the legendary Francois Kevorkian, where someone asked him how he plans his mixes. He said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt, I let the music tell me what it wants to be next.‚Äù We all know that feeling when it just seems like the tracks are picking themselves, you know just how to mix them without even thinking, and the musical energy flows through you in a beautiful feedback loop with the crowd. It‚Äôs just magic. 

If you‚Äôre like me and have thousands of tracks, there is no way to plan this kind of moment. The ‚ÄúLittle Data, Lotta Love‚Äù approach helps me do what I do best (read the crowd, feel the music, let the moment flow through the tracks to create a magical night) by using the computer to do what it does best (sort and process lots and lots of information). It‚Äôs better than a ‚Äúnext song generator‚Äù like Smoothie or Next because it‚Äôs based on *your* feelings and *your* impressions of the tracks, not what someone else played or some algorithm tells you would work. But it uses the best of both worlds to help you create magic moments.

I hope this is useful. Thanks again to /u/BasCurtiz for helping make this happen with his custom Foobar 2000 scripts that I modified to fit my needs. Now go let the music move you and tell me what you think!"

The household is a group of 47, 35, and 22-year-old roomates. Right after the ball dropped, the 22-year-old comes out with her Bluetooth speaker and asks if I can turn off so she can play. I'm not precious, I'm like yeah ask the crowd. They cheered. I'm like, ""go for it!:

GIRL FUCKING ROCKED IT.  By the second song, all the kids are singing along and dancing. She's just playing songs on Spotify, no mixing, no flair, just an earnest love of the music that she and her friends appreciate. She's screaming to wake the neighbors, and the younger crowd is going nuts. 

A bunch of the older crowd apologizes to me, as I sit back and watch, smoking hookah, drinking whisky and bobbing my head and smiling. ""Nah, this is what it is about. Look at them. They're having the time of their lives, and we've got all the food and liquor.""

20 years ago, I would have probably flown off the handle, like ""how dare you?"". Instead, decades of this shit has instilled one important lesson. Listen to the crowd.

169,Fred again's Boiler Room set: Discussion,347,DJs,210,"A lot of people have been talking about Fred Again's recent Boiler Room set (check it out here if you haven't seen it already: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-hvjV2A5Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-hvjV2A5Y))

It's really been blowing up recently and seems to stand out. That got me thinking, why? What, if anything, makes it stand out? And what, if anything, does it say about the scene?

My take away is that it's an interesting moment in electronic music right now. It's a fusion of styles and vibes that seems to resonate with people in a way which I haven't seen very often. This includes track selection, mixing style, and audience.

I've been meaning to write it up for discussion, so I outlined what stood out about it for me below. Would love to hear your thoughts.

*TL;DR: Fred again‚Äôs set is blowing up and I think it represents a little watershed of a moment, for the reasons I list below. I predict he‚Äôll be huge this year, others will follow in his footsteps, and for at least a few seasons, this sound and vibe will trend hard.*

**Garage meets EDM meets pop meets DnB &** **Dubstep**

First, a lot of his songs mix elements of UK Garage, which has been blowing up over the last 12 months, drum and bass, dubstep, creative tech house and mainstream EDM / pop. He does it in a way that is both accessible to the general public but still authentic to the original genres. It's surprisingly not shit.

Take the transition around 20:00 minutes or so, which is an Overmono vs Lil Baby remix. It's got lush, musical and melodic pads, mixed with huge EDM-style chords, and poppy vocoder rap lyrics by Lil Baby.

This is the kind of stuff I'd usually gag at. But then he blends it with a super tough garage beat and rumbling, dubstep-infused bass line, kind of like a Dirty Bird tech house track mixed with a slower rollers track. It's tough, dirty, original and sick, but also pretty.

Or take his rewind at around 56:00 minutes. Sick raga style MC'ing, devastating bass line, dnb style pullback. It‚Äôs actually a Skrillex vs Four Tet vs Fred Again track and it is NASTY. Like at home in any dirty dnb set in the darkest of basements, but then he transitions into an airy, beautiful, proggy feeling track that is dangerously close to EDM. But it still works. Again, a set full of that would make me kill myself, but the combination of these styles actually works really, really well.

There's been a lot of talk about Beyonce or Drake ""infusing life into house music"", which is pure bullshit. But this kind of hybrid is fresh, original and creative. 

The crowd loves it, the viewers love it (it's got a million views in just over a week), and I suspect we'll see a lot of people following his lead in the near future. We might see the underground becoming prettier and more poppy and the overground becoming tougher and more gritty / interesting. And that's not a bad thing, I reckon.

**Finger drumming in public**

Second, his set is one of the more high profile ""controllerism"" / finger drumming performances on Boiler Room, if not one of the first. Of course many people have been doing this for a while but you rarely see finger drumming routines on Boiler Room. This seems to have come as a revelation for a lot of people, as can be seen by the number of TikTok and insta clips of this part of his set, as well as discussions here on Reddit. I predict we'll see a lot of people trying hybrid sets

**V I B E S**

Finally, his set is fucking HAPPY. Everyone is having a freaking blast, a genuine, open hearted good time. Even the part where famous little Tommy Jeans guy accidentally stops the music, the vibe is just fucking lovely. No one is hating, everyone is friendly, light hearted and delightful. It's not a set which is full of itself, gate keeping, over serious or dark in any way. Given all the shit in the world right now, I think this speaks to something people want as well.

**So what?**

It could just be a bit of clever SEO and nice marketing, but the fusion of styles between pop, EDM and more traditionally ""underground"" sounds feels like something different and meaningful to me. 

Maybe I've been hiding under a rock, but I think it's notable and will have a lot of influence on others heading in this direction.

What do you guys think? Storm in a tea cup or meaningful moment in the current state of the nightlife?"

I love DJing, I‚Äôm very much into all sorts of techno, house, disco and everything in between, it is a joy to play music that people enjoy dancing to and I‚Äôm having a great time when I‚Äôm doing it.

However, the ‚Äûcoolness‚Äú of DJing, fueled by constant Instagram/YouTube image cultivation (and I‚Äôm not talking about ‚ÄûTikTok Techno‚Äú, everyone has an IG account to promote their stuff), the mystification of DJs and their cult status among their peers (√† la ‚ÄûI know the DJ‚Äú, ‚ÄûI‚Äôm on the guestlist‚Äú) is irritating to me to say the least.

Like I really enjoy DJing, but I enjoy going to events much, much less because I find myself cringing at all of the above.

Apparently there was a time when you couldn‚Äôt really see the DJ. Sometimes I wish we could have this again, because I don‚Äôt want to be in the spotlight and when I‚Äôm dancing I don‚Äôt want to pseudo-religiously be worshipping the altar that is the DJ booth.

Ahhh, I feel much better after hating on anyone but myself again :)


Edit: Maybe some commenters are slightly misunderstanding: I‚Äôm not trashing against mainstream techno (even though it probably sounds like it), neither against social media. I‚Äôm in the ‚Äûunderground‚Äú scene in my home town, and I know great crowds, home parties, illegal raves which have been and continue to be fantastic.

* [4MidiLoop](https://www.dj-lab.de/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/4midil_1.gif) a controller that was made completely modeled after the Traktor layout. ‚Ç¨1300 priced at retail, this was a really expensive controller.

* [Akai AMX](http://kb.inmusicbrands.com/media/images/akai/AMX_ortho_10x8_media\(1\).jpg) because it got really overshadowed by the Native Instruments Traktor Z1/X1 combo. It works as a legit DVS interface. It even has a mini-Innofader in there and is Serato certified.

* [Allen & Heath Xone:K1](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/710xSkt7I7L._AC_SY606_.jpg) it's the little brother to the more famous K2. It's almost exactly the same. Except it doesn't have latching layers nor an audio interface. The K2 is still in production 10 years after its release.

* [Allen & Heath Xone:PB](http://images.musicstore.de/images/1280/allen-und-heath-xone-pb-patchbay-_1_DJE0003548-000.jpg) this is basically a switch for switching between regular throughput and DVS boxes. So you don't have to mess with the back of the mixer pulling out cables and such. Lovely to switch between setups.

* [Behringer DDM4000](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71hGitvVW-L._AC_SL1000_.jpg) all my homies hate Uli. But you can't really deny that this mixer quite different compared to their normal sub-par line-up. Especially since it is a fully configurable mixer, almost any setting on this mixer can be adjusted, because it's all digital. Really makes you wonder why no other mixers have that functionality.

* [Casio XW-DJ1](https://d29rinwu2hi5i3.cloudfront.net/article_media/fe4f6c07-f9a3-4574-b385-b28ec222cc68/table.jpg) Casio also made a few interesting DJ and music production gear. Especially Millenium Falcon-looking thing.

* [DJ-Tech DJ Mouse](https://s11234.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Djmouse-Scratch_Tech.jpg) it's not a mouse... It's a *DJ* mouse... It's absolutely terrible, I love it. I just bought a used one just now.

* [EKS Otus](https://www.recordcase.de/media/image/92/fd/f3/1342193703-21952-158ead0b58a03c_600x600.jpg) just look at it. It's basically a MIDI jog wheel controller shaped to fit over a turntable. It even has dual layers.

* [Native Instruments Traktor D2](https://www.recordcase.de/media/image/67/7b/53/Native-Instruments-TRAKTOR-KONTROL-D25a9e86b0786a6_600x600.jpg) the addon controller that makes Traktor work with a closed laptop. No more laptop in front of you. And have a dual-layer deck that controls and displays everything you need in Traktor.

* [Novation Twitch](https://s11234.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Novation-Twitch.jpg) because it was one of the first jogless controllers. It really paved the way for doing things differently. That being jogless controllers which unfortunately never caught on.

* [Numark Orbit](https://www.numark.com/images/sized/images/product_large/Orbit_Ortho_WebLG-624x390.jpg) this strange-looking wireless DJ controller. So you can DJ while on the dance floor yourself. It even controls 4 decks.

* [Numark X2](https://img.audiofanzine.com/images/u/product/normal/numark-x2-49893.jpg) is it a turntable, is it a CD player? It's both. Is it any good at those things? I don't actually know.

* [Pacemaker](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/66/Pacemaker_pocket_dj_system.jpg) well, this thing definitely has its share of fans here in the comments. I can't tell you all that much about it, since I really don't know much about it. But I feel peer pressure to include it.

* [Red Sound InFader](https://live.staticflickr.com/7444/10201929603_92ba25b86f_z.jpg) ""As my sweet mother always said, if one crossfader is good, two crossfader are better, and three crossfaders, well, that's just good business.""

* [Red Sound Soundbite](https://www.djresource.eu/images/gear/redsound-soundbyte-pro.jpg) I don't know if I should include this one. Since the device itself is really good, it's highly sought after, and still worth a lot on the used market. Basically, it's a looper, but one with a really accurate BPM algorithm. Meaning you can record highly accurate vinyl samples on this thing.

* [Stanton SA-5](https://www.djresource.eu/images/gear/stanton-sa-5.jpg) you know how rotary mixers are all the hype? This thing is the reverse of that. It doesn't have a single rotary knob/encoder on it, it's faders all the way down.

* [Stanton SCS.3M](http://www.digitaldjtips.com/app/uploads/2010/11/Stanton-SC-System-3.jpg) because it doesn't really have any physical controls you'd normally expect. Plus it looks incredibly retro space-age.

* [Stanton SCS.4DJ](https://cdn.digitaldjtips.com/app/uploads/2011/08/04022525/Stanton-SCS4DJ1.jpg) because it was a standalone unit almost 10 years before anyone else really got into that. That's pretty incredible.

* [Tascam TT-M1](https://tascam.com/images/products/tt-m1/ttm1-down.jpg) it's a tonearm replacement, like Phase DJ, but long before that ever existed.

* [Tascam X9](https://c1.zzounds.com/media/productmedia/fit,2018by3200/quality,85/x-9-09f53710d13f5bb28f39adb8f2480109.jpg) see those weird high EQs? They are 2 separate adjustable parameters. One is the regular cut/boost, the other is the parametric band EQ.

* [Technics SL-DZ1200](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Technics_SL-DZ1200_Digital_DJ_Turntable.jpg) the thing that would not be. Apparently, on its launch, it was a terrible player. And while things got sorted out later. It was already too late, the CDJ-1000 took the market. And the rest is history. Maybe Technics would've owned the booth with this if it didn't fail spectacularly. I still think it's the most beautiful CD player ever made.

* [Wacom Nextbeat](https://www.synthtopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/nextbeat_undocked.jpg) it's a standalone device, but the device also has a wireless component to it.

* [Zomo MC-1000](https://www.recordcase.de/media/image/cb/28/b7/Zomo-MC-1000-Pro-Mount-Kit-PMK-3-4_600x600.jpg) this is basically a weird addon controller that can basically replace 4 seperate decks.

**Vestax: now there have been companies that experimented with things, some successful, some less so... And there is Vestax.**
These guys were absolutely mental. To this day I think it's the best DJ brand ever. Their Vestax VCI-100 controller basically shaped the way for digital DJing as we know it today. And with brilliance also comes madness. Vestax went bankrupt in 2014. And the DJ gear world got a little worse for it.

* [Vestax AA-88](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CEUZcetWEAA6Alk.jpg:large) a Mini-Disc and CD player/mixer with 4 channels and pitch control.

* [Vestax CDX-16](https://www.audiounion.jp/stock_images/44929.jpg) this thing basically has everything you need in one package. CD players, mixer with crossfader, pitch control, line inputs, phono inputs, mic input.

* [Vestax Controller One](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f9/8a/d1/f98ad1297c187a6f10df0ffe885d2c2f.jpg) arguably the best turntable ever. Far ahead of its time. Only 100 of these decks were made. And they go for obscene prices now on the used market.

* [Vestax Faderboard](http://www.skratchworx.com/images/Vestax/faderboard/faderboard_top.png) this absolutely weird sampler, fader piano thing.

* [Vestax Groove Caster](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/77/ff/f677ffdb8148cbb580900a0b8ac663cc.jpg) a Vestax scratch guitar. Yes, a scratch guitar!

* [Vestax Micro 5](http://www.skratchworx.com/images/micro_5.jpg) as the name implies, it's an incredibly small mixer.

* [Vestax PDT-5000](https://www.djresource.eu/images/gear/vestax-pdt-5000.jpg) II don't know if this would be considered weird, but the analog pitch meter is definitely something I haven't seen on any other turntable.

* [Vestax PDX-01](https://medias.audiofanzine.com/images/normal/vestax-pdx-01-2961655.jpg) it's a round Vestax turntable, because why not?

* [Vestax PMC-005 AMK 3](https://i.imgur.com/xFlEOoe.jpg) it looks like one of those weird top-loading washing machines, but with the plastic body those special editions Nintendo 64 came in. And I simply don't know what to think of it. It just looks weird, and kind of funny. 

* [Vestax PMC-06T](https://smlycdn.akamaized.net/data/product2/2/b974a17428464e8c1c95aace2f6a3866149fbd5a_l.jpg) it's such a weird mixer. I understand the concept of it. But in practice, that really can't be ergonomic. Plus its shape kind of resembles a...

* [Vestax PMC-580](http://www.dj-lab.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/vpcm_2a.jpg) I don't think the world was ready for this mixer just yet. Allen & Heath in 2011 released their Xone:DB4, and that was very well-liked. And people say this mixer has been a huge influence on it. If you put them side by side, it's kind of difficult not to see the similarities.

* [Vestax PVT-e2](https://www.otaiweb.com/player/vestax/pvt_e2_large.jpg) a Vestax turntable that you could pivot. No idea why, but it exists.

* [Vestax QFO](https://www.recordcase.de/media/image/ec/46/60/1135154299-2292158eac388a638e_600x600.jpg) a weird Vestax hybrid turntable/mixer, designed by Qbert.

* [Vestax S-1](https://technabob.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/vestax_s1.jpg) you'd think they would be done with 1 scratch guitar? No. They were not.

* [Vestax STC-V1](https://cdn.djworx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vestax-stc-v1.jpg)in fact they made 3 different scratch guitars.

* [Vestax VCM-600](https://www.recordcase.de/media/image/b2/94/3d/Vestax-VCM-600-DJ-Controller-15a3392ac2ea88.jpg) this MIDI controller is more or less a sort of hybrid studio controller that also works as a DJ controller. I can see this working for live production really well. 

* [Vestax VRX-2000](https://static.turbosquid.com/Preview/2014/05/26__10_25_47/Vestax_VRX_2000_00.jpgb704078b-1611-4032-a7eb-c270a946137eOriginal.jpg) cut your own records at home with this thing.

I might add a few more later on. But I wanted to share some of these curious pieces of DJ gear. If you know any yourself, please comment. I'd love to see more strange DJ gear.

Edit 1: more stuff!

Edit 2: the Vestax crew attended me towards some more madlad stuff.

Edit 3: cleaned the topic up by listing them alphabetically.

Edit 4: added a little more backstory to most of the items.

Edit 5: more have been added.

Edit 6: added 1 more entry, corrected some spelling.

Edit 7: big edit. DJTechTools contacted me. And asked me to write articles for them. And well. I did! Here is the first installment of my Weird DJ Gear series! https://djtechtools.com/2021/06/28/weird-dj-gear-the-underrated-the-odd-and-the-ones-that-made-history/

226,**/r/DJs NEW RULES** Please read before posting,297,DJs,99,"New /r/DJs  Rules.


**Top rule - BE NICE.**

* Please try to be polite, friendly and helpful when commenting.
* Trolling, slapfights, general assholery is not encouraged and it also goes without saying that **racist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic posts and language will not be tolerated** at all.

**Moderation policy**

* /r/DJs is not a big sub.  We tend to encourage discussion and engagement first and foremost.  There will be times posts that are seemingly against the sub rules will be left up because the discussion in the comments is informative and engaging.  This is generally more for when a post breaking (certain) rules was missed and the community has already heavily engaged in discussion.  If you see posts breaking the rules, reporting them will help us remove them earlier.
* remember to search - lots of questions tend to be asked multiple times and plenty of answers are given in the archives
* remember that if you are a regular user, newer users are allowed to discuss the same things if it's not overly-frequent.  Just because something was discussed 3 months ago doesn't mean users can't have another conversation about it.


**Please ensure you are posting to the correct subreddit**

 * /r/DJs is generally for more experienced/professional DJ discussion.  There is an entire subreddit dedicated to learning DJing and is filled with experienced DJs willing to spend time helping people out.

**Any and all beginner questions and posts should be made in /r/Beatmatch.**

*Beginner questions include posts that start with:*
 
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm new at this‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI want to get into DJing‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI just started‚Äù
* etc.

*And includes anything basic like:*

* ‚ÄúWhat controller/headphones/speakers should I buy?‚Äù (within reason - someone experienced looking for higher end gear or looking for real world feedback on pro-level stuff is fine).
* ‚ÄúWhat program should I use?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHow do I use this effect?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIs beat matching really important?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWhy the hate for sync?‚Äù
* etc.

*Any beginner posts here will be deleted.*


**DJ Setup pictures belong in /r/DJsetups.**

* There will be some exceptions - some rare or classic booths or extraordinary setups will stay up, but if you want to post a picture of your DDJ 400 and KRK Rockits, your Technics 1200s and DDJ S9, or a standard CDJ NXS setup that we've all seen, please post to the appropriate sub.

**Meme/Humor/crappy image posts belong in /r/DJsCircleJerk.**

* This includes the low effort, ""djs be like dis‚Äù - *stupid picture* - type posts and the like.

**Mixes**

* Most mix posts will be deleted. 
* Short routines, showcasing of interesting technique, and videos that shows off the poster doing something cool is fine. We will also allow high profile posts - say if a regular user gets a feature mix on DJCity or a Serato sponsored set.
* Sets from high profile DJs like boiler room or festivals sets is allowed.
* DJs who want to share mixes can post in /r/mixes or a weekly mix thread that we will be starting soon.

**Gig pictures/Stories**

* We're starting a new weekly sticky every Monday specifically for gig pictures and stories.  We've been seeing a lot more of these posts and while they tend to be heavily upvoted, they also end up just being a picture of some DJ hunched over a setup with a bunch of back-patting in the comments that clutters up the sub.  Any posts of this nature will be deleted and the user will be directed to the weekly Sticky thread.

**The following topics are against sub rules and will be deleted:**

* Self-promotion posts including mixes, tunes, events, companies, competitions, etc.  The one exception we may allow are open deck nights that members of /r/DJs can attend.
* For-sale posts
* Posts discussing music piracy (in the sense of people asking how where or how to pirate music, if you want to have an actual discussion on piracy and how it pertains to the industry, by all means).  Support the people who make your hobby/career possible. 
* Obvious spam for youtube channels/gig logs/blogs/advertisements from members who have no participation in the sub. If people are regular posters on this sub and have a video/service/etc they wish to share, we will allow it initially, although regular spam of it will not be tolerated.
* Posts asking ‚Äúwhat should I play for this gig?‚Äù  This is a sub for experienced DJs, if you need to ask the internet what to play for a gig, you probably shouldn't have taken the gig.  General music discussion is absolutely fine.
* Spotify playlist posts

PLEASE REPORT posts and comments that violate the above rules or just suck. Thank you!"

I've been a DJ for 20 years, or near enough that it doesn't matter. Over half my life, anyway. I started when I was barely old enough to drive as a mobile guy with gigs at a local youth nightclub, then struggled, scrimped and saved to buy my first pair of turntables (and they weren't even Technics). Over the years I've spent untold thousands on music and even more on equipment, but when I started I was spending every free dime I had buying vinyl singles from one of the first online stores (since no one in my town carried vinyl). I still have a directly-descended copy of the very first song I downloaded off the internet (daft punk - da funk), and got my first club residency (which I subsequently bombed) at 19. New Years Eve 2000 still ranks as the very best show I've ever been a part of. People thought the world was going to end and they partied like it. 

I bought the first generation of CDJ1000's with a loan my mom had to co-sign on. I had a mixshow on a national digital cable station, I've opened for international acts, played live to air on a 100,000 W radio station from the biggest bar in the city; the same bar where I dropped 'The Way You Make Me Feel' at midnight on Saturday the week Michael Jackson died and I have never felt the rush of the crowd like that one moment. I did over 100 mobile gigs in a single year. I've drank my wages and even played for free, and DJ money put me through college with no loans and bought my wife's engagement ring. The gig I did the week after my first daughter was born was one of the most relaxed, smoothest gigs I've ever played. 

I played every Friday and Saturday in 2 bars simultaneously for over 2 years. I've been to more weddings in one summer than most people attend in a lifetime. I'm a feature in the background of thousands of dance floor photos. I have shed blood, sweat, and tears for this life. I've done bar mitzvahs, eaten more turkey dinner at corporate Christmas parties than you can possibly imagine, DJ'ed a wedding that featured a bridal party made up of strippers, and a wedding where I'm relatively sure the couple broke up in front of me. I watched junior high grind lines in the school gym and I've seen seniors all but have sex on the dance floor at aftergrads. 

I've never DJ'ed a festival, though not for lack of trying. I've produced a few remixes and played them out (though they really never should have been), but I've never produced a track of my own. I'm just one of the nameless, faceless DJ's who puts in work every weekend playing music at the bar or your event for 6 hours at a time to make the people dance; the working class of DJ's.

I've DJ'ed sex and swinger parties and even got a little under the booth action at one. My #metoo story happened while I was DJ'ing. My wife saw me play at a nightclub several years before we met and recalls thinking I had a great voice (though she hated my music). I got the worst whiskey dick of my life with a girl I brought home from the bar I was playing at. 

I've gotten black out drunk and held it down, and crashed and burned sober. I've played in front of thousands of people, I've played on massive concert sound systems with full lighting, and I've played to bars with 6 people in them all night on a sound system that was literally held together by duct tape. I've set up and struck gear at all hours of the day - literally; I've been a part of a 3 day setup and once had to strike an entire flown-rig system in under 15 minutes (everything ended up in a heap in the parking lot that we then spent 3 hours packing up properly). I've been gushed over by my clients, I've been told I'm the best, and I've been lambasted as not knowing a damn thing. I've nearly been in a fist fight with a groom because of how rude he was to me with no provocation or prior reason.

I've held the crowd in the palm of my hand, seemingly able to do no wrong, and I've had nights where every track was a struggle. A struggle to pick, a struggle to mix, a struggle to play.

After all of that and so much more, these last ones seem to be more and more common. Last night was like that.

This has been coming down the rails for a long time. Pretty much since another fateful NYE gig that ended on a very sour note. I've just been delaying it. 

I've played 4 gigs so far this year. That's all. Every one of them has been a similar struggle: weeks spent doing music research in advance since with 3 kids and a full time job I don't really keep up anymore. Then I get to the gig and while I keep the dance floor full and get compliments on my set, it's been a long time since I felt like I found a groove, locked into it, and tore the roof off the place properly. I leave feeling like I could do better, every time. I know I would if I played more, but I'm obviously not putting in the effort on many levels. 

I did a wedding earlier this year and the months leading up to it I was stressed. Even though I had made the decision that it would be my last wedding as a DJ. That's another discussion outside of this, but suffice it to say I'm done there. And glad of it. 

Last night, though, I played a gig at a bar I very occasionally fill in at and although I was a little worried expected the usual good time as I've had some VERY successful nights there. But last night ended up being every bit of the struggle I hoped it wouldn't.  

I have one more event booked for NYE this year and nothing after that, and so I think it may be my last official gig. It seems fitting; most of my most memorable and best gigs of my career have been new years eve and the one I have booked for this year is a good client I've done many times and they've always been a great crowd. This one is shaping up to be the same. After that, who knows. It's been a good, long, incredible run, with some of the best (and worst) memories of my life coming from being behind the decks. 

But I think the time has come to stop the turntable, unplug my headphones, center all my EQ knobs, and turn the faders down one last time... and leave them there.

This has been a long read, and I appreciate any and all who have come this far with me. I have one more thing to say, if you'll pardon me soapboxing for one more minute.

To all the DJ's who are just getting started: throw yourselves into this. It's an amazing, beautiful, incredibly fun, and yet painful, dark mistress. Chase the feeling the music gives you. It can give so much to you, but be careful it doesn't take too much in return.

Have fun. Make the people dance. But above all: enjoy it. It's a wild ride.

Thanks for everything. 

Edit: some words. Also a big, heartfelt thank you to all who seem to resonate with this story and to everyone that's commented. I'm feeling the love and you have no idea how much it means to me."
242,Popular opinion: You hire a DJ. Not a spotify playlist.,287,DJs,116,"I‚Äôm often hired for some private party‚Äôs. Very often last minute. (Ex.this friday i got a call at 11h30pm for a party 2hrs away that starts at noon the following day). I always ask what type of music they wanna hear because it is a shit show to download songs into serato Mid-set. I always get the same answer ‚Äúwe like everything‚Äù. So I prepare a ‚Äúeverything‚Äù set (house,techno,rap,bass house,trap,pop,rock...etc). Then a few hours(minutes) into the set , you get people that want that and that song (or worse, they want you to play a song you already played). Then , when you get out a bit of some people comfort zones (that is especially a problem with rap lovers) they come and tell you you know nothing about good music and shit...meanwhile if they looked around them they would see all those booty cheeks dancing on the floor because I chose to play tropical house instead of Sicko mode for the 3rd time.

I guess what i‚Äôm trying to say is : if you hire a plumber , you wont come and try to tell him how to repair a leak. Well if you hire a DJ, that is YOU giving control of the music at your party to somebody else. I won‚Äôt say no to a few request , but if you‚Äôre in my face with your phone open on your fave beat every 5 min i‚Äôm gonna hate you for ever."

246,The music is better than you think it is.,290,DJs,65,"A lot of DJ's these days seem to think that in order to crush it on the decks, they need to have a bunch of tricks up their sleeve. They think they need to know everything about effects, the EQ and the filters. They gotta have a gobs of transition ideas and master the loops.

What most of todays DJ's don't realize, is that back in the day when we spun vinyl, all we had was a crossfader.

One crossfader.

And you know what?

We killed it with that crossfader.

We killed it with the music.

Todays decks and mixers offer a huge variety of tools to help DJ's make things interesting. But all those tools isn't what makes a set.

It's playing dope ass tracks and playing them at the right time.

It's understanding the flow of energy. Things start out calm and cool. Then the energy increases until the roof is on fire. The vibe goes down, up, down, up and down until your done. You end the set with a milestone to make sure everyone remembers you.

Believe me when I tell you, that the music is where it's at. Give more attention to what you play and when you play it. The music will take care of everything."

The price is ridiculous for what it does. They copied what Denon GO did three years ago but slapped their label on it and made it way more expensive. The only benefits are portability, ease of setting up, and ‚Äúaesthetic.‚Äù The controls look terrible, sliders are so small, and it‚Äôs missing some key features for professional performance. The battery only lasts 5 hours. It‚Äôs not truly ‚Äúwireless‚Äù you have to RCA into a chunky AlphaTheta receiver (which they list nothing about in the website, I literally can‚Äôt tell anywhere if it‚Äôs included with the product)  The USB input on the back hurts my soul, and don‚Äôt get me started on the ‚ÄúBluetooth audio input enables the crowd to join‚Äù lmao 

The problem is, no one taking DJing seriously would invest in this. This is not for clubs, promoters, or anyone in industry. And no one casually DJing would pay that much for a toy like this‚Ä¶ unless they had disposable income. Nobody asked for this. If they wanted the rebrand to be taken seriously, they should‚Äôve come out with a more serious product.

I didn't record a lot of my mixes, i only have about 20 or so still recorded sadly. I never had a mad desire to be famous, just loved doing it. I did about half on vinyl before i switched to ableton (mid 00s). The ableton ones are better, no question - pristine mixing on some of my favourite tunes. I haven't listened for a while, but i did a recap during lockdown. But here was my surprise. It was the worst mixes on the vinyl that have all the memories. I remember where i was, who was with me, the bad mixes i made (and recorded) sometimes off the cuff with no pre-planning. It's strange, but very nostalgic.

I'm not saying that you should share this stuff online if you want to get followers, gain support. But if you're messing around with friends, record that stuff and keep it. You will thank yourself, i promise

Don't know if anyone will care about this post, but if even one person reads this i'll be happy. I believe that most people that really love DJing end up putting a lot of memories into certain tunes. Trust me, this will pay you back years later."

My first gig was a wedding. My dad was there and he said this is your gig I'm just there to help you out if needed.

I practiced my ass off at home, desperately wanting to impress my dad and the audience. 

I started playing, mixing and scratching like a maniac. After 15 minutes my dad tapped my on my shoulder and whispered in my ear:

Press que and start counting.

But.. but.. I'm mixing

Just do it, trust me

So I presses the que button and started counting, he counted with me. After 43 seconds one guy in the front said

""Hey, where'd the music go""

My dad grabbed the mic and introduced us, congratulated the married couple and said it could get pretty lonely behind the booth. So please come and join us and bring your requests. And made a joke that requests aren't free but cost one sparkling water.

They loved it.

He told me to Press play and let the songs play out, mix the last couple of beats or do an echo out.
We had a blast, So did the guess. Within 40 minutes we had a full page of requests and 4 sparkling water.

I never forgot what he said

Be a good Host
Make yourself approuchable 
Let them pick the music
Let the songs play out
Talk to people
Walk the room

Ever since we did gigs together, he had a heart attack recently. Alive and stubborn but not able to do gigs.

Every gig After 15 minutes I Press que, wait till they notice the silence and introduce myself. And on Nights when drinks are free I make the joke about the sparkling water.

Its not about mixing or gear it's about the way you carry yourself.

As usual, we've invited our friends, they invited their friends, and as a result we've ended up having a full-fledged rave in a forest with 8 DJs and 200+ party people!

People loved our event and the concept so much, that since then we are bombarded with contacts. The number of people who would like to come is growing every day, so far we are more than 600 in the ""guest list"" and most of them will come with plus people. We went so viral that some people wish to come even from other cities that are 2+ hours away...

We are potentially are looking at about 700-1000 people at our next event. Well... That's going to be literally a shitshow because at the first event we didn't have any toilets, no security, nothing, as it meant to be a small forest party/rave with friends. Even if we asked everyone to don't throw garbage away and to clean up after themselves, we had to collect a ton of garbage at the end.

Since we can't handle that 700-1000 people ourselves, we have to get professionals involved, in terms of toilets, security and cleaning up.

So here I am for advice.
Someone with experience in organising events, please tell me:
- How many portable toilets do you need per 100 people?
- How many security personnel is needed per 100 people?
- How many cleaning personnel needed to clean up after 100 people?

Also, any other advice is very welcome ü§ó"

315,How I became a better DJ over time.,258,DJs,32,"Hey r/Djs 

Bit of a long post ahead. But I am taking this time to write for all those who are starting off, or veterans who would like to chime in.

Like many people here, I started off with a basic 2 channel pioneer controller. I dont have any sort of musical background, so it took a lot of trail and error, but my first way of learning was lining up waveforms to beat match. After practicing on and off for about a year I started to upgrade my bedroom setup to equipment you would have in a club as I felt I needed to be more comfortable. So I skipped the cdjs and went vinyl (later bought 2 xdj700s). 

I began collecting and practicing djing on vinyl for a few years before I fundamentally ""mastered"" beat matching by ear, riding the pitch and so on. But the important part was learning to listen and training my ears. 

As mentioned, I never had any sort of musical background so beats/bars/phrases are all new to me, I was mixing in records where I felt a phrase was long enough for the new record to come in seemingly. It wasnt until I started watching ellaskins and other vinyl djing tutorials to understand what phrase mixing was. 

This is where my real improvement came in. Its one thing to have 2 tracks in beat/time, but its another thing to have them mixed in phrase. Even the simplest transition, or mashing up 2 records, putting them in at the same phrase timing (depending on the records) can really create interesting sounds. I started to experiment with this a lot more, recording mixes for my own personal growth, and putting out other mixes for a ""series/playlist"" on my soundcloud. This is where you can really understand how much you improve by listening to old mixes compared to new ones. 

Having the time to experiment, listen and improve on my mixing has really improved my skills as a DJ. These are actually quite simple, and this might be pretty easy for most, but as said before I had no musical background nor anyone teaching me. I dont even have any use for looping intros as I pickup phrases and cue in. 

After approx 5 years of djing, I'd like to say I am quite confident that I am ""skillful"" (and I use that word lightly as most of the points I mention are quite basic), but I'm always looking for ways to improve. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Below are summarized points of above, plus extra points on things ive learned while gigging. I know this may be pretty straight forward to most, but nobody has guided me to help me learn what I know today so I hope this helps someone:

1. Always practice. 
2. Learn your music
3. Learn to listen
4. Learn how to beat match by ear
5. Learn how to phrase mix 
6. Record your mixes, learn why it sucks/sounds good and go from there
7. Support the artists and buy their records/tracks however possible. 
8. Music selection is the most important factor in a set. Id say 70%. 30% is mixing. 
9. Keep yourself updated with new/old record labels to dig into. There is so much great music out there if you look hard enough. 
10. Club standard gear doesn't necessarily make you a better DJ (the above points makes you a better DJ). Just helps you be more prepared for the inevitable when youre faced with foreign gear.
11. Most of the booth monitors in clubs/bars suck. Rely on your own headphones for monitoring, but you should not be locked in too much in your headphones as you need to hear whats happening on the PA from time to time (could accidentally have HPF/LPF activated without you knowing etc).
12. Warming up the room is an important skill. Learn to build your collection of music and to organize it for your gig.
13. Know your place in a time slot. Don't bangout and tire out people before peak hours/headliner plays. This goes hand in hand with volume control (I've seen promoters/sound techs gossip/argue about opening djs who ruin the night because of this).
14. Be professional, show up early if you can. Stay late if you can. Dont be that person who takes a timeslot and leaves right after to goto another party. Most times than not, the party is made up of friends in the industry who all work together one way or another, and it doesnt look good to just leave right after your set (unless you actually have to, or youre an international DJ who needs to leave right away to catch the next flight). 
15. More on #14, dont show up trashed. Take any gig small/big as a blessing of an opportunity. Humble and remind yourself why you started this venture in the first place. If you require alcohol/drugs to ""perform"" due to social stresses/anxiety, then you should seek therapy to help overcome these rather than substances. 
16. Do your research on people youre on the lineup/bill with. It doesnt hurt to know more about them. 
17. Go out to other peoples events. Get to know people. Join local collectives/groups. Do your best to be a part of the community. Supporting others will usually follow with support for you. 
18. Mistakes happen. How you fix the mistake really measures how skillful you are. In my opinion, hearing tracks go slightly off beat then, back on beat are always great. Even better when the needle skips mid mix. Reminds people youre actually doing something. 
19. DJing for a crowd of 15 people is a lot harder than djing for 100+ people.
20. Learn to find inspiration from other djs/artists. But dont bite their routines/styles and pawn it off as your own. 

Thanks for reading!"
316,The DJ does not need a crowd...,257,DJs,48,"I'm posting this to give voice to an aspect of DJing I think is under represented here. My background is that I've been DJing since the early 90s. This is through college, early career, marriage, 2 kids, etc... I am first and foremost an active music lover. DJing is one facet of that lifelong love.

My argument is that it's equally valid to DJ for yourself or for the art of DJing as it is to be crowd- or event- focused. And when you start your musical journey, there shouldn't *necessarily* be an expectation that you'll DJ in front of people.

This stems from my belief that DJing is primarily a musical endeavor. We start playing instruments as children. And those of us who keep playing enjoy the physical act of playing, the self-improvement, and the output of making music. As young musicians progress, they give recitals (because it's a requirement), and they may join the school band. A social aspect begins to form, but very few youngsters are focused on the performer/audience/performance relationship. The motivation is mostly due to enjoying the act of making the music. This continues (or starts) into adulthood, as people play for themselves: most do not give performances. To me, DJing is similar...

Earlier in my life I had the opportunity to DJ in public. I've DJed clubs, raves, house parties, festivals, art openings, but never once did I pursue the gig. I was a very online person, and promoters must have liked my enthusiastic posts (in addition to mixes that I enjoyed sharing). And that mix-sharing came from the motivation that every music fan has; sharing what they love.
  
Later in my life, I lost all touch with any kind of music scene. And that's fine, but loving music remains as bedrock of my identity. Being a ""DJ Musician"" is part of that. And so I'm on Spotify for 10s of thousands of minutes a year, and I buy hundreds of dance-focused tracks a year, and spend my weekends making mixes, organizing music, and researching music - 100% for me. 

So here's the view that I want people to take away: DJing is fundamentally a creative musical endeavor; it is quite similar to playing an instrument. The majority of people who play instruments are not focused on the performance aspect. DJing can following exactly in that mold.

(n.b., nothing above was written to contradict others, but bring balance: the music-focused and performance/crowd focused concepts of a DJ can coexist. We are friends, we learn from each other, we criticize one another, and we enjoy the other's mixes.)"

And I just want to put down my thoughts on this. I find it odd this sort of thing is seemingly normalized. In essence, you are telling your partner who has a hobby that sparks joy for them, that the items required for it are a bother. And in some cases ""has to be sold"". I just want to dig into the fact that one person is pressuring a loved one into giving up an activity that they enjoy. And how incredibly messed up that is. Don't take away enjoyable things from people you care about. That makes you a very toxic person. And I don't want to turn this into women versus men thing... But if a man would tell a woman to get rid of her hobby items that wouldn't fly one bit. Neither should the reverse. Let people enjoy things.

So idk what I was expecting with djing (finally took the plunge and dropped money on an xdj-rx2 so i can play showsüòÉ)but WOW this so much harder than i imagined.

I grew up playing music, and I was that asshole who could pick up and play most instruments really well without much practice.

Goddamn it is NOT the case with DJing. Sure, beatmatching isn‚Äôt too hard, using the cue, crossfading, ‚Äúcross fading‚Äù with the EQ‚Ä¶ Whatever. Performing all these little actions isn‚Äôt too hard imo.

What I feel like is really under-appreciated is simply knowing WHEN to end a track, start a new track, knowing if those two tracks even sound good together (this takes sooo long), and of course at what points do they sound good together. Beatmatching isn‚Äôt hard on it‚Äôs own, but when you take everything else into account and sometimes you‚Äôve got like a 10 second time window‚Ä¶holy shit it‚Äôs overwhelming

339,I need to rant about a recent DJ experience DJing a house party.....,245,DJs,80,"so my close friends GF was hosting a big party for her bday. She's a big house/techno/tech house fan and asked me to DJ since that's basically what I spin. I asked her for a spotify playlist so I could download the music she wanted and that was that. I get to the party, start setting up my gear (XDJ's and 900nxs2 mixer) and a fellow DJ comes over and is like 'woah I didn't know you DJ'd, that's sick man, so do I! I do mainly hip hop though'. In my head I'm like 'I know exactly how this evening will pan out. I'm going to setup, gunna start DJing and he's gunna ask if he can spin'.....and that's exactly what went on. I got it all setup, turned on the music and he was awkwardly standing there. He was more of a bedroom DJ and has never spun on a classic pioneer setup so I was nice enough to let him spin a bit to give him experience on some newer gear.   


He wasn't the best but he seemed to be having fun and I was walking him through the different effects and what not. It was fun for the first 20 min but then he's like 'you got any hip hop?' and I was like nah, I was told to just download the playlist (I'm not a fan of hip hop and have none on my computer). he's like 'ah shit, I can run to my house quick that's like 20 min away and bring my controller and laptop to hook up. I was like '.....bro don't worry, just DJ the next party'. He's like alright cool cool......'.   


He then wouldn't really move from the tables, keep spinning and was train wrecking hard, which is fine, he's new to the gear, I get it but like I'm trying to play some chunes and have a good time, not worry about people bothering me. He asks me again, 'bro I don't live too far, I can grab my stuff.' I was like 'if you want, go for it'. At this point I was annoyed and didn't feel like DJing anymore because it was killing the vibe a bit. I was expecting him to come back, he can spin on his controller and I can fuck off to the party and get drunk lol and not worry about it. A funny thing happened next...  


He leaves, and in the meantime, another guest came who was also a tech house/house/techno DJ and he came over to chat and be super cool about it. He's like 'I got my USB, mind if I plug in and we'll do a b2b with 2 songs each?' (THIS IS HOW YOU APPROACH IT). I said fuck ya, so we b2b for like 30 min, and it was fun, people were enjoying the tunes and I then say to take over because I wanna go play beer games and stuff. He takes over, seems to be having a fun time and then the hip-hop guy comes back with his computer, controller and hard drive. He comes up to me and is like 'so can I plug in?' and I'm like 'idk, ask buddy who's DJing'. He goes over and the guy didn't really wanna say no but he's like 'the vibe is good, just let it be'. Hip-hop guy came back to me and I'm like 'bro, idk what else you want from me, just DJ the next party'. 

He ended up letting it go and he left not too long after that. 

Guys, please. Do not do this. We get it, you DJ, your grandma DJ's, so does your dog. If you see a DJ at a house party, you can chat them up but please don't be hip-hop guy. It's annoying as fuck and wastes peoples time. Enjoy the party and then just DJ the next one. If hip-hop guy had a USB with rekordbox music on it, I would've been like okay np, you plug and play but to travel 40min home and back with all your gear.....just why? To show everyone how sick of a DJ you are?  


Anyways I needed to rant, thanks for listening to my TedTalk. I'm curious what you guys think of this and if you would've been annoyed too or maybe I'm being a typical DJ Diva and I need to eat a snickers."
340,The one thing they don't tell you about being a professional DJ...,243,DJs,43,"In my 10 years as a touring DJ, I've noticed the importance of good mental health is always overlooked, especially by aspiring DJs trying to make their dreams a reality.

Professional DJing is not a career for the mentally weak. Every touring artist, across all genres of music and art forms, will at some point struggle with their mental health. It's the nature of the job. The combination of easy access to substances, long and late hours, irregular sleep schedules, pressure to sell tickets, social media presence/comparisons, and the need to constantly produce great art for fans, all while paying the bills, will create a ticking time bomb that will explode if not managed meticulously. I battle with this balancing act regularly, so I wanted to provide my top tips for all of you out there:

1. Self-care Is Non-Negotiable: You will burn out if you can't care for yourself. Whether meditation, exercise, healthy eating, or simply taking time for yourself, ensure you're nurturing your physical and emotional well-being amidst the hectic touring schedule.

2. Establish Boundaries: The word ""No"" is your friend and essential in carving out moments for rest. This could mean turning down a gig or the third afterparty of the weekend.

3. Stay Connected: Touring is isolating, so stay connected with loved ones and fellow DJs. Maintain relationships the best you can. Surrounding yourself with a supportive network can provide much-needed comfort and encouragement.

4. Practice Mindfulness: Incorporate mindfulness practices into your daily routine. Whether meditation, breathing exercises, or appreciating your surroundings, mindfulness can help reduce stress amidst the chaos of touring.

5. Seek Professional Support: Don't hesitate to seek professional support if you struggle. Touring can take a toll on mental well-being, and having a therapist or counselor to talk to goes a long way. Many therapists offer virtual sessions, making it easier to access support while on the road.

6. Stay Balanced: Take breaks from the nightlife scene when possible, engage in activities that bring you joy outside of DJing, and remember to prioritize your overall well-being above all else. Sometimes partying all night is exactly what you need to blow off steam. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY!

Don't get me wrong, I love being able to DJ for a living. It was my dream, and it still is. I just thought I'd shine a light on the other side of the industry that isn't talked about as much.  "

I‚Äôve heard from the planner that the bride is devastated and not the mood or mindset to make decisions about music, which I respect and understand. Has anyone ever dealt with this scenario? How‚Äôd you navigate? Thanks in advance and wish me luck lol the playlist


Edit - this garnered a lot more attention than I expected so thank you all for your input, both the intelligent and the not so intelligent. However, I do wanna address a couple of things.

1. This is not a panic post. I‚Äôm not asking ‚Äúwhat should I do?‚Äù After re-reading the post I can see how you may have thought that however, the intention of this post was more of a ‚Äúshare your story‚Äù type of thing. I‚Äôm not terrified of the gig.  I am confident enough in both my Dj & social skills that this will not be a ‚Äúnightmare‚Äú set. 

2. I mentioned in the comments that I had the bride review the playlist, and I think some of you took this as me asking her to choose the music for her event. If you were one of these people, you are wrong. I simply wanted to make sure that I do not play a song that she does not want to hear, which I believe is completely reasonable in this scenario. 

3. Some of you suggested that I just refund and cancel the event. I‚Äôm not sure if you understand how weddings or events for that purpose work. There are a lot of elements to weddings.. venue, vendors, entertainment, family etc. I‚Äôve had talks with both the bride and the planner. I‚Äôve even offered to waive my cancellation clause for this particular case and the bride wishes to continue with the party, so why would I cancel on her? Her groom already left her hanging and you‚Äôre suggesting that DJ follow suit? I question some of y‚Äôall‚Äôs professionalism. It sounds like you‚Äôre afraid of a challenge. The worst case scenario for me is that I learn enough how to play this gig next time, should this scenario ever arise again.

Thank you to those who provided usable advice and thank you to all of the lil trolls under the bridge. I‚Äôll make an updated post after the event and let you all know how it goes."

When I first started as a 16 year old in 1998, us Event DJs were still using Tape Decks. We didn‚Äôt use Vinyl because the music library was physically too large vs tapes. We use to remove the covers of the tape decks, to leave the tape exposed, because some of the players had terrible fast-forward (FF) track searching and it would often Cue a couple of beats/seconds into the song, so we kept the covers off so we could stick our fingers in the reel of the tape and manually wind-it-back a few millimeters, for a better Cue point. 

When compact disc (CD) players came out it was a exciting. But we didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúanti-skip‚Äù right away. These old ‚ÄòDJ console‚Äô (usually a road case with the double CD player on top and a mixer below, mounted to a shelf, that you would pull out), we‚Äôre so sensitive that if anyone bumped the table, the CD would skip. Think about that, you know how busy the dj booth gets at parties, imagine the entire party stopping everytime someone bumped the table when requesting a song etc. To prevent this, we had big sponges we would put under the DJ consoles that would literally sway the box when it got bumped, and they looked so ridiculously terrible. 

I used to carrry around a 70lbs box with hundreds of cds. We had to remember which CD compilation had which songs and if we forgot we had to literally look it up in a catalogue. Playlisting usually meant flipping CDs diagonally in their carrying case for quick access. When at-home CD burning technology became affordable, this helped tremendously, we could make our own CD playlists.

Anti-skip was a big deal. CD burning was a big deal. Imagine when Serato came out. It was paradigm shifting. No more heavy cd cases or big boxed DJ consoles, I could DJ with a laptop and a mixer and search my music library in seconds. I still can‚Äôt believe it. 

Picking it back up for fun, I‚Äôm further astonished at how far we‚Äôve come. I recently bought the Numark Mixstream Pro. It‚Äôs a standalone controller. I can put music on a usb drive or use Tidal/Dropbox. I don‚Äôt even need a laptop. It also had a built in DMX lighting controller. All for about $600usd. I am literally mindblown.

Now anyone can be a DJ with very little investment. And I think that is a awesome. Things only get better when more people have access to it. I can‚Äôt wait to see where YOU all take this in the next 20 years!

Great community!! I‚Äôm enjoying being a part of it!! Keep the people dancing <3"

369,"There is no meaningful, discernible difference between 320kbps MP3s and lossless audio",237,DJs,197,"Reposting a comment I made in another thread to make this clear, since it comes up again and again. 

Study after study have shown that only a tiny minority of highly experienced people listening in a studio setting with high quality audio equipment can tell the difference between uncompressed audio and high bitrate MP3s. 

Here‚Äôs an easily accessible study, with the findings highlighted below. 

https://www.academia.edu/441306/Subjective_Evaluation_of_MP3_Compression_for_Different_Musical_Genres

>	Over all musical excerpts, listeners significantly preferred (p<0.05) CD quality files to mp3 files for bitrates ranging from 96 to 192 kbits/s.

>	The results are not significant between CD quality files and mp3 files for higher bitrates (256 and 320 kbits/s). Regarding comparisons amongst mp3 files with different levels of compression, listeners always significantly preferred the higher quality version, except for the comparison  between 320 and 256 kbits/s where the results did not reach statistical significance.

>	Specifically, we observed that trained listeners can discriminate and significantly prefer CD quality over mp3 compressed files for bitrates ranging from 96 to 192 kbits/s.

>	Regarding higher bitrates (256 and 320 kbits/s), they could not discriminate CD quality over mp3 while expert listeners, with more years of studio experience, could in the same listening conditions in Sutherland‚Äôs study [8].

>	Differences between young sound engineers and experts can be attributed to improved critical listening skills based on individual listening experiences. Furthermore, sound engineers and musicians may not focus on the same sound criteria when listening to music.

In other words, your audience doesn‚Äôt know, can‚Äôt tell, or even care if you‚Äôre playing 320‚Äôs vs wavs. 

Highly trained DJs and producers, on very well tuned systems in a properly set up club might. But even then, in the real world, 99.999% of all gigging environments and audiences will not be able to tell - *even on a big system*. 

Yes, playing anything less than 320 is more easily discernible, even for the average customer. Playing YouTube tips is totally obvious. In same cases as well, under extreme pitch bending circumstances, the difference may be clear. But for all practical purposes, 320 kbps MP3‚Äôs sound identical to uncompressed formats.

*************

**UPDATE:**

I sourced a few more studies that address some of the points raised in the comments. All evidence points to the fact that *in both real world and controlled environments, the difference is effectively imperceptible*. 

1.	A larger study with a sample size of N=100. Same results: https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijdmb/2019/8265301/
2.	A study comparing different listening equipment. Same result: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301428302_Perceived_Audio_Quality_for_Streaming_Stereo_Music
3.	Another study with a similar sample size. Same results: https://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=19397
4.	A study showing how playing MP3‚Äôs on a sound system removes the ability to hear artefacts (due to reverb, room acoustics and cross talk): https://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=12896
5.	A study which shows that MP3 can produce slightly different emotional impressions but that reverb (room sounds) eliminates this effect: https://repository.ust.hk/ir/Record/1783.1-105601

You can ignore these and everyone‚Äôs personal preference is their own. But all the evidence I can find - in all the studies I have access to - indicate that there is effectively no perceptible difference in almost all cases (particularly in real world settings). 

Doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre playing in your AirPods or on a Funktion One, the audience can‚Äôt tell and doesn‚Äôt care (in 99.99% of cases in the real world).

Everything else matters a lot more; including DAC quality, mixer quality, amp quality, amp settings, processing, speaker quality, speaker placement, speaker calibration, room size, room shape, room treatment, crowd size and crowd noise. 

So don‚Äôt stress, buy the format you like, and never play YouRube rips. Ever.

> it might sound basic, but i still think that one of the best things you can do if you're learning to DJ is to cover up the BPM readers and learn to mix by ear. there are a few reasons for this, and none of them are about authenticity or elitism, or what equipment you've decided to start using
> 
> most newer DJing technology has been designed to streamline the experience of playing music, but technology will always let you down occasionally, whether it's down to a flaw in the tech itself or errors you've made in preparation to use that tech. if you're too reliant on it working perfectly, then you won't be able to correct errors by ear when they do happen. if you can learn to mix by ear, you'll end up with a more intuitive understanding of why a blend might be working, or why it might not be despite the BPMs matching
> 
> two tracks can be mathematically in time with each other, but can sound like carnage if the rhythmic emphasis across those tracks is very different. if you've learnt to mix by ear you'll eventually be better equipped to think about what songs will fit together effortlessly and which will require a heavier handed approach in the mix. or, if you've decided that car crashes and heavy clangs are key to your aesthetic, you'll be able to implement them with intention! :)
> 
> if you can mix by ear, you also don't have to do as much tedious laptop admin preparing your set. you don't need to sit in rekordbox or serato for as long. you'll be able to trust yourself to improvise and you'll feel more relaxed in the club itself as a result 
> 
> it's hard to articulate this kind of thing without sounding like a hippie, and this is mostly just a personal observation - but a big part of what's kept me engaged with this for so many years is that when im really enjoying a set, i can get into some kind of flow state through playing the music. when i can get to that state, i feel at one with the ~~vibezzz~. it's effortless and it feels like i'm inside the music. but if i'm overwhelmingly focused on the functionality of the CDJs and on stuff ive prepped in rekordbox, it's harder to get to that place, and it can feel more like just another numbing screen-based activity - and crucially, that makes the end result *sound different*"

A lot of people stress over being able to get the perfect cues or beat loops or things to transition a track.

424,How I pull an extra $35k a year + 401k with match from DJing (28 years old),218,DJs,104,"I‚Äôve been into DJing since I was in high school. Like many of you, I fell in love with it and never looked back. Early on I was all about playing clubs, I‚Äôd play almost every weekend in my early 20‚Äôs and earn anywhere from $150-$350 a night. I thought this was great money, working until 2 am, all my friends right there with me. Then, I found weddings. More specifically a multi-op company that does over 400 weddings a year. I sent them an email, got the ball rolling and I‚Äôve been with them for 6 years now. I don‚Äôt have to do any booking, any contract questions, any self promotion‚Ä¶they fill my schedule and I get the job done. I do about 35 weddings a year ON ONLY SATURDAYS. They pay me $1000+ per wedding along with a 4% 401k match. DJing went from something that I make some grocery money with to almost a full secondary salary just working 32 out of 52 Saturday‚Äôs. One of the best parts is I‚Äôm usually home and on the couch by 10:30pm. I‚Äôm only posting this because I never thought in my wildest dreams I‚Äôd be making this kind of extra money DJing. My 401k with the company is already saved up to over 50k, all just spinning records. If you have any interest in teaming up with a local op, odds are you can find one by searching ‚Äúwedding dj‚Äù in your area and follow the bread crumbs. You can make a legitimate living DJing no doubt. If I wanted to do more than one wedding a weekend I could pull $3k+ working Friday, Saturday, Sunday."
425,"After 8 years of DJing I just finished playing a set in Tokyo. Don't quit, follow your passion, be positive, help others out. Take every gig you can, you never know who you run into.",220,DJs,39,"I played small gigs, big festivals. Crappy venues, awesome venues. I have been cussed out, praised. I am not the best DJ, I might be very average but I take every opportunity. Every gig you pass I take and I will have gained more experience. Met new people, made new friends.

This is not my work. It's my hobby and without this hobby I as an introvert with a past of very low self-esteem would've never ventured far outside my country (the Netherlands) except for maybe the odd festival just over the border as an audience member. I have played all over my country, Belgium, Germany, the UK, Poland and now I am in Japan. My dream vacation that I have been dreaming about for the last 20 years and now I am here. And I can't really put into words how it makes me feel.

DJing might be the best hobby in the world. Keep going. GANBATTE!

427,Music Is Not Available Online Forever,216,DJs,87,"I think as professional DJs this conversation about streaming is missing the real, and most important details to working DJs.

It is important, and I can't stress this enough, to backup AND to purchase your music. 

Since the early 2000s I have been collecting music 
mp3/wav files. Occasionally a hard drive would fail, or I would forget a password to a streaming service account, etc. 

I would search and search, but never find some songs again. Small bootlegs or remixes, songs that didn't properly clear licensing, can just dissapear forever. 

If I did find some of them, they may be at crappy lowfi quality, through some pirate source, not worth playing for a crowd of 500 people. Some artists have no information about them available, so you can't track them down.

And eventually you forget about them, and those hidden gems are gone forever. 

If you rely on streaming alone, this will happen to you. There are plenty of songs that get removed from all streaming sources, a year or two later, due to licensing problems.

Streaming service are great, I use Tidal often when I am playing an open format gig, and someone's grandma wants to hear the Platters.

But Streaming services are very controlled by the industry and a lot of great songs are removed due to legal issues.

Download, purchase, store, back up, and save your music.

Most older DJs have their white whale track that they can never find, or is only available now on vinyl for $500,  but rarely comes up available.

It is our job not just to entertain but often to do so with unique or special music, and we have all seen music dissapear from the Internet. We have to rely on a strong library, not just streaming services."

432,The dark paradox of success in the music industry,216,DJs,67,"TL;DR Success is a paradox. Often, it's what we crave the most that destroys us. A deep dive into the underbelly of artistic and creative success.

>***I‚Äôve loved attention my whole life‚Ä¶but¬†I don‚Äôt think anyone knows what fame actually is. Because if I did want to be famous‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt this kind.***  
>  
>**Billie Eilish**

# The pursuit of fame

Artists and creatives want to be renowned for their work. We are driven by our passions and our purpose.

Artists and creatives are insecure. There‚Äôs a spectrum ‚Äî a continuum. I‚Äôm on it. You‚Äôre on it ‚Äî we all are.¬†

The questions we ask ourselves are:¬†**Am I good enough? Or if we‚Äôve tasted success before: Am I**¬†***still***¬†**good enough?**

Many successful artists are insecure overachievers. They are driven by their insecurities. They‚Äôre highly competitive people who never feel good enough, which drives them to work even harder in their quest for approval.¬†

>***I had enormous self-image problems and very low self-esteem, which I hid behind obsessive writing and performing. ‚Ä¶. I really felt so utterly inadequate. I thought the work was the only thing of value.***¬†  
>  
>**David Bowie**

In his book, Orville Gilbert Brim, the social psychologist and author of¬†*Look at Me! The Fame Motive from Childhood to Death*¬†stated that modern culture was full of people who want to¬†be famous so they can feel accepted. He talks in depth about the basic human need for approval.

The British Psychological Society did extensive studies into the seemingly universal desire for fame.

They list various reasons such as narcissism, altruism but mostly their studies showed participants wanted to use fame to overcome insecurities and low self-esteem.¬†

**We all seek external validation.**¬†

¬†And why wouldn‚Äôt we? We have grown up being praised and rewarded when we pleased our parents and teachers and scorned when we did not.¬†

**We want to seen. We want to be relevant.**¬†

In a sea of billions, we want our voices to be heard above the crashing waves of mediocrity.¬†

**We want to feel good enough.**¬†

# ¬†The sweet seduction of success

The first taste of success is incredibly intoxicating. Artists and producers who have struggled for years and years are suddenly thrust into the spotlight.¬†

Songs that were previously ignored fill nationwide radio playlists and global Spotify charts, getting millions of streams a day.¬†

Artist‚Äôs are invited to perform on the biggest TV talk shows, they sell out huge venues and everybody gushes about them on social media.

They are new and shiny and the public is smitten. It is the ultimate validation for any artist. But it doesn‚Äôt last.

**You see, most artists believe that creative success will fix them. That it will fill the voids in their self-esteem.**

That a new found confidence will course through their bodies and fill the emptiness they feel inside. They think success will make them happy.¬†

**They are wrong.**¬†

Fame will 10 X your insecurities and fears.¬†

>***If I‚Äôve learned anything, it is this: fame will not fix your problems.***¬†¬†  
>  
>***Instead, fame is likely to magnify all of your insecurities and exaggerate all of your fears. It‚Äôs like picking up a fire extinguisher for your pain that ends up being a canister of gasoline***  
>  
>**Tim Ferris**

# The happiness paradox

**The basic premise of society is if you work hard you will be successful and then you will be happy. It is the American dream.**

This is what society has told you, this is what pop culture has sold you, this is what your parents have implored upon you.

But that is broken and backwards.

Every time you experience success you change the goal to an even bigger one and thus never reach it.¬†

**It‚Äôs a hedonic treadmill**

&#x200B;

* You get 5 million streams, you want 10 million streams   
 
* You make a million dollars, you want $2 million dollars.   
 
* You have a number 1 hit, you immediately want another one.   
 

>***Happiness is an emotional response to an outcome. If I win I will be happy, if I don‚Äôt ‚Äî I won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a if then, cause and effect, quid pro quo standard that we can‚Äôt sustain. Because we immediately raise it every time we attain it.***¬†  
>  
>**Matthew McConaughy**

The more we chase happiness through success and the applause of strangers, the further away we get from it.¬†

**Happiness is not a destination.**¬†

The harsh truth is, after working towards a goal we were convinced would make us happy for years, sometimes decades, only to realise it‚Äôs all been an illusion is a depressing realisation.¬†

>***I had bought into the not uncommon notion that when I tasted success when I get over there I‚Äôll be happy. But the strangest thing happened, as the show got more successful ‚Äî I got more depressed.***  
>  
>**Josh Radner**

Researchers call it the expectation gap. The difference between our perception of success being greater than the reality of success

**Expectation gap = expectations > reality.**

The pressures to perform are overwhelmingly intense. The more successful we become, the more we feel we‚Äôre not good enough.

>***The more successful I get, the more insecurities I'm getting, it's weird.¬†I don't know if it's because I'm so blown away that people like what I do, but I just feel like I'm never going to live up to it.'***¬†  
>  
>***‚ÄòI have¬†anxiety attacks, constant panicking on stage, my heart feels like it's going to explode because I never feel like I'm going to deliver, ever.‚Äô***  
>  
>**Adele**

Successful artists and producers feel they have to be perfect. Their whole identity and self-esteem are built on the approval of people they don‚Äôt know. They read everything that is written about them and every comment.¬†

They ignore all the positive comments and obsess over the tiny fraction of nasty, hurtful and spiteful remarks that cut to the very bone.¬†

>***Every DJ, no matter how big or how small, deals with a certain amount of insecurities. The pressure can be huge. Every artist is a perfectionist.***  
>  
>***We all read everything that is being said about us. That is the truth.***  
>  
>**Armin Van Buuren**

It‚Äôs a vacuous job. Artists‚Äô are always approving photographs and videos of themselves.¬†

They are being judged on how they look and how they act.

They constantly feel the need to be perfect. For their work to be culture defining. The pressures to constantly outperform every time are crippling.¬†

>***There‚Äôs so much pressure putting new music out. If I don‚Äôt beat everything I‚Äôve done prior it will be deemed as a colossal failure***  
>  
>**Taylor Swift**

**Perfection is an illusion.**

It‚Äôs an unachievable and impossible goal that only serves to create deeper feelings of imposter syndrome.

And their self-esteem becomes more and more reliant on the applause of strangers as a result.¬†

>***We‚Äôre people that got into this life because we want people to like us. We‚Äôre intrinsically insecure because we like the sound of people clapping because it makes us forget how much we don‚Äôt feel good enough. I‚Äôve been doing this for 15 years and I‚Äôm tired.***  
>  
>**Taylor Swift**

**Success does not make you happy. Happiness makes you successful**

# It‚Äôs a human thing

After two decades of working closely with famous, successful artists the truth is¬† ‚Äì for most of us, anyway ‚Äì we are just not emotionally designed to be famous.¬†

**We are too insecure.**

We care too much what others think. We can‚Äôt handle the overwhelming pressure of living up to unrealistic expectations.¬†

This is why there‚Äôs so much substance abuse, depression and mental health issues with artists and creative at all levels.¬†

We get swept up in external validation. When our self-esteem relies on the public and the industries approval we lose our identity.¬†

>***Sometimes I don't feel as if I'm a person at all. I'm just a collection of other people's ideas.‚Äù***¬†  
>  
>**David Bowie**

**The irony of success is, you may be loved millions who worship you for the person they**¬†***think***¬†**you are.**¬†

**Yet you spend every night alone wishing just one person loved you for who you**¬†***really***¬†**are.**¬†

Success will lead you to question your faith in humanity.¬†

You will become paranoid. You think everybody has an ulterior motive.¬†

You will be suspicious of the motives of people that are less successful than you.¬†

As people who are more successful will be suspicious of you.¬†

And your world gets smaller and smaller.¬†

>***It‚Äôs amazing how lonely you can become***¬†  
>  
>**Rihanna**

Most artists and creatives are driven to succeed so they can be liked and accepted. Yet they end up isolating themselves out of fear and anxiety. They are lonely. It‚Äôs tragically ironic.¬†

Ed Sheeran pays four old school friends to go on tour with him.¬†

He doesn‚Äôt trust anyone else and doesn‚Äôt want to be alone, while he plays to hundreds of thousands of adoring fans who pay a small fortune to see him on tour.

# The moral of the story

>***I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it‚Äôs not the answer.***  
>  
>**Jim Carrey**

Success will not make you happy. It will not fix you.¬†

**It will make your insecurities bigger. And your fears deeper.**¬†

Whether you‚Äôre a hobbyist, a DIY independent act or a successful artist or producer, if you want to avoid creative misery then you have to stop focusing on outcomes.

You can‚Äôt control outcomes. They control you. All you can control is your effort, your attitude and your reactions.¬†

**Trust me. It took me two decades to work this out.**¬†

We all want approval ‚Äî especially in our creative work.

The problems begin when we chase them. When we start creating material we think¬†*you*¬†will like, instead of what¬†*we*¬†love to do. Or becoming a person we¬†*think*¬†you will like, instead of being ourselves.¬†

**We lose our identities.**

If our identities and self-worth are welded to our creative success; our happiness and fulfilment are in the hands of others.¬†

Everyone wants to be happier. But you won‚Äôt find it in the approval of others. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre trying to please 100 or 100,000 fans, the results are the same.

The applause of strangers and critics are like a drug, the more you get, the more you will need.¬†

**It‚Äôs chasing happiness and fulfilment on a hedonic treadmill. You will never catch it.**¬†

The joy is in the process. It‚Äôs in the marginal gains and mastering your craft.

It devoting yourself to being the best artist and creative you can be regardless of the outcomes. It‚Äôs creating for yourself and not others.¬†

The only comparison is with yourself. Am I better today than I was last month? Am I an artist or creative who is true to themselves?

True artists create what they love regardless of what you think. 

**Be authentic.**

Accept yourself for what you are. Accept yourself for what you are not.¬†

**People will respect you for being true.**

**But more importantly, you will respect yourself for being**¬†***you.***¬†

Peace out

433,So this happened during my set at a festival this weekend.,213,DJs,23,
434,Best. Request. Ever.,216,DJs,88,"I got a great request last night and it kinda made my night.

I have a weekly residency at a bar in Seattle that is themed like a space ship disco from the jungle.

I spin a bunch of disco deep cuts & edits, Brazilian disco, and  disco house. There is a small dance floor that is really more of a listening lounge people chill and drink in.

Last night it was pretty busy around 10pm and this fantastic request occurs:

""Do you do requests?!"" - Girl 1

""Sorry, vinyl only night, so requests are pretty hard. What are you looking for? I might have something if it's disco."" - me

:Blank stares:

""What's a popular disco song?"" - Girl 1

""Uhh, well that's why I'm here, because I know the popular disco songs and brought them with me"" - me

:Looks up from Google: - ""can you play ABBA? They were popular"" - Girl 2

""Uhh, sure, I'll get you an ABBA track in a few songs. I'm just starting the night off and need to build some energy for that."" - me

""Why not now? This isn't a popular song."" (I'm playing [AS - Mr K](https://youtu.be/AiCwhMO7jUE), it's only not popular to you, but I'll bite my tongue and play nice). - Girl 2

""That's now really how DJing works, I'm not a jukebox, but I'll mix your song in when it's ready. Trust me, I'm here every week and I'll play the hits."" - me

: Eye rolls and walks away :

Now I'm pretty annoyed by the interaction, but I try and be the better person and get the song in the queue.

I play Gimme, Gimme, Gimme 5 songs later. Me eyes eagled in on them. They aren't dancing. They don't even notice... But they notice me looking at them and this makes them come over and say ""when are you going to play ABBA?"" Girl 2

""This is ABBA..."" - me

""Oh, I've never heard of it, why was this popular?"" girl 1 

üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ

I bring ABBA with my not because I like it, I actually dislike most of ABBA. I bring it for the requests. But this time I feel like I got Rick Rolled into playing a song I hate for a person who doesn't even know what the song is. I just couldn't stop laughing."

462,"r/DJs will be going dark from tomorrow, June 12th",207,DJs,108,"Dear [r/DJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/),

As  many of you know, Reddit is acting extremely poorly in regards to its users, mods and community.

Many, many subs, some much larger than ours, are going dark temporarily or indefinitely to voice our frustration and displeasure with their blatant attempt to extract as much value as possible from the community before their upcoming IPO.

We recently held a poll to discuss what we should do. [Over 1,100 of you (85% of those who responded)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/141edkd/should_rdjs_go_dark_on_june_12th_to_support_3rd/) decided to support our community and go dark, starting tomorrow, lasting for ~~an indefinite amount of time~~ **at least 48 hours.**

Since then, things have escalated significantly. Reddit staff and executives have been lying, gaslighting, and generally ignoring the requests of the people who make this site thrive; you, me, and all users and volunteer mods. [See this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/145vns0/the_future_of_rvideos/) from [r/videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/) describing what has happened and why they will be going dark, indefinitely.

**This post is to confirm that yes,** [r/DJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/) **will go dark, starting from tomorrow (June 12th), for AT LEAST 48 hours but POSSIBLY for an indefinite amount of time** until Reddit responds and/or changes its policies.

We don't know how long this will last, but here are a few things to consider (ht to the mods at [r/videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/) for this):

**Short FAQ:**

**Q: Won‚Äôt Reddit just remove you as moderators and reopen the subreddit?**

>A:   This is a distinct possibility, Reddit has made it clear that the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù of their site is more important to them. We as a team are prepared for this, none of us want to continue to volunteer for a   company that disrespects the people who helped  build it into the front page of the internet.

**Q: An indefinite lockdown? I thought this was only supposed to be for 48 hours?**

>A:   Originally it was our intention to spread awareness of these issues, but over the past week it has become clear that Reddit doesn‚Äôt intend to   act in good faith, and our role in the protest became clear. The owners of Reddit have taken their users, community developers, and their  moderator teams for granted and used them to build up a multimillion dollar company which is now focused not on the community, but on how  many commas they can get out of Silicon Valley investors.

**Q: What can we as users do to support this protest?**

>A:   The best way you can make your opinion known is by stopping using reddit. At the very least you can try and reduce your usage of the site,   consider using alternatives such as [**Tildes**](https://tildes.net/) which I‚Äôve personally found to be a nice change of pace from the traditional Reddit experience.

As others have said, it's been a hell of a ride. We hope this won't be the end, but it could be. We could get kicked off as mods and banned, permanently.

If that happens, thank you to everyone who has made [r/DJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/) an incredible space for learning, sharing, and celebrating this thing we all hold so dear.

If that doesn't happen, however, and the public and media backlash is so great that Reddit reverses course, well then, brothers and sisters, see you at the after party on the other side!

Keep on mixing, [r/DJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/). From all of us mods here at [r/DJs](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/), it's been a pleasure."

Phase, Rebekah, Daria, and Truncate(he played at the afters on Saturday) all listened to my set, enjoyed it, and even danced a little. The promoter also told me that Phase commented on my contesting set(he listened to it when he was in Miami last week) and my DJ set from yesterday.

476,PSA: Alcohol is an occupational hazard for DJs.,205,DJs,68,"When I started my career as a resident DJ minion (how to: show up a bit after the opening every day, make friends with all the staff, don‚Äôt stay in the booth all night, take as little room in the booth as possible), my main job was going back and forth carrying slightly Coke tinted whiskey. 

It soon became obvious that the resident was a high functioning alcoholic. In fact, pretty much every resident of the many clubs in town were, at the very least, chugging a hefty dose every night. 

Bartenders are [2.33 times more likely than average to die from an alcohol-related death](https://www.alcoholrehabguide.org/resources/professionals/). DJs are probably in the same boat. 

We have a job where we‚Äôre not only allowed to drink, but alcohol is free, the public we‚Äôre catering to is drunk and often offer you drinks.

Be careful, alcohol addiction can sneak up on you very easily. Be mindful of how much and how often you partake.

500,"If you're bored, you're boring",198,DJs,116,"This is the best quote I've ever heard when it comes to DJing. I used to have trouble practicing enough, because I would get bored with what I was doing. I was talking to a DJ friend about this, and he told me I shouldn't ever be bored while I'm practicing and/or performing. He said ""If you're bored, you're boring."" If you're bored, the audience probably is too.

I've been able to use this advice to make DJing a lot more fun for myself, and hopefully for people around me too! If I start feeling bored I know that's when I have to do something - add FX, use an Acapella, switch the track, whatever! It's helped me to make way cooler sets and to be way more motivated to practice. Now when I get bored in practice it's exciting because I immediately stop what I'm doing, and get to take the challenge of making things cool again.

I hope this helps somebody else as much as it has helped me!"

527,Why is the Skrillex x Fred Again x Four Tet show at Coachella praised so much?,194,DJs,354,"I'm actually scared to ask this because it seems to be such a universally accepted attitude literally everywhere, so I am afraid that this will be downvoted. I would appreciate it if you would still give it a read however and share your thoughts under this post. 

Before I explain why I don't understand the praise, I want to say that I love both Skrillex and Fred Again, they're amazing artists, Skrillex, in particular, having lots of history and Fred Again literally just breathing music ever since we've known about him. I have no clue who Four Tet is but everyone calls him some sort of legend, it might be because I'm not from the US. This might be part of the problem. 

What first should be noted is that it was clear that the trio did not prepare a show. I loved to see that they had fun on stage and were trying random things out and making them work, but it was clear that they were just doing it as they went. If their music was not as widely known as it currently is, it most likely wouldn't really have resonated because of the many long pauses, and since this was the closing act of Coachella I can imagine anyone there is desperate for any party they can still get. 

Now knowing that they probably figured it all out as they went, I did like the transitions that Skrillex made in particular, but I also know him to be a talented DJ and didn't really expect much less from him. Also, Fred Again making the crowd feel like a brotherhood must have been amazing. 

But then, Four Tet. I really don't know who he is, and Wikipedia isn't helping me much. I would like to point out his main additions to the set:

1. Oftentimes completely different from the flow of the set, he would play a (famous) song that randomly transitioned into Dubstep. I love Dubstep but if I didn't know that this was Coachella I would be convinced he was trolling. 
2. A good rewind never hurts, giving the song the love it deserves and reliving the buildup and potentially unexpected banger that drops after. But Four Tet did it 4 TIMES on 1 song. 4 times in a row. I got so annoyed after the second already. 
3. Some pop/punk song that is very famous, for sing along. I'm an all-round DJ myself and play songs like that all the time, I love them and when it fits the artist I love listening to them on a festival as well. But they were just so... random. Skrillex and Fred Again would create a vibe and suddenly there was American rock playing. Again, I'm convinced the reason it even partly worked is because people there were so desperate for a party they would vibe to anything they were able to vibe to, and I too love singing my heart out to sing along music. But it just didn't make any sense. 

There were also very long pauses oftentimes that got me out of the flow and honestly, I'm glad they had a great time but I don't like that it's praised so much more than it probably should. However, I would like to know your thoughts, and in particular why my perception of it might be so against what other people think!"

619,"A DJ mentor of mine is almost gone due to stroke/Alzheimers, and it makes me very sad. I just wanted to tell you about him.",179,DJs,29,"My first ""real"" DJ job was when I was 16 at a local roller skating rink. I'm aging myself here by the fact that it was a roller skating rink (lol). I learned to beat mix and follow a format on an old GLI mixer, mismatched turntables, and EQ/Amps that were locked up where I couldn't touch them, but I was the DJ. Fast forward to my senior year of high school, a friend of a friend refers me to come talk to this guy who owned a local mobile DJ business. I'd heard of the business, they did all the high school proms and such. The guy was a businessman with an MBA degree, but using his intelligence to basically rule the region in the DJ business. He ran upwards of 15 systems each weekend, with a staff of one DJ per system, and a couple roadies per system.  We had some elaborate setups - not only did we have the two turntables, UREI 1620 mixers, Crown power amps, but also video screens, lights, and a 55 gallon heated dry ice drum that we would use at gigs.

This guy was incredibly smart, engineering and building his own lighting controllers, snake cables, coffin consoles (before these were mass produced like the ones we have today), designing and building his own speakers and subwoofers, before adopting the mass production JBL stuff, designing light fixtures that would fit perfectly into a road case, and the road cases all were measured to fit exactly into the trucks a certain way. Every little detail was thought out. And then there was his customer interaction which was always spot-on. He would always coach each DJ going to each job on the room they were going to, the manager at the venue and how to talk to them, detailed diagrams of each venue and where to get the 5 or 6 individual circuits we needed for power, everything.

To say that working for this guy, I learned a lot, is a huge understatement. And he got the jobs. Just before I joined, he took his system to play a Super Bowl party back in the 80s (he remembers meeting OJ and Al Cowlings at some party with CBS people EDIT: This had to be 83 or 87, as I remember it being in Los Angeles, and Simpson/Cowlings weren't players, but they were at the event), a prominent local CEO's wedding and also his holiday party as his ski resort in Colorado, and numerous other high end jobs. Also a recurring booking for one of the larger ballroom NYE parties in Chicago, at one point, I think he had that job for 27 years straight. We did weddings, school parties, and corporate events, but the big money was in the bar mitzvah world. You have an entire audience of kids who can't wait to one-up each other. So he would bring more give-aways, better give-aways, to the point where the blow-up toys and stuffed animals he would give away as prizes throughout the night was costlier than his booking fee. But it was all margin, and it was very lucrative!

I worked for him in high school, then moved on and did something else for a few years, but then met up and rejoined him a few years later for a few more years of work, and then he started to slow down and move out of the business as he moved to another city with a new wife. This also resulted in him  shifting his business towards photography. His thinking there was he had the customer service and sales skills, plus could work with couples approximately the same way as when doing the DJ thing, and that worked great. And he could load and unload photography gear by himself, whereas not so much with the DJ gear anymore.

About 4 years ago, I'm talking to him, and he's telling me that he had some kind of neurological  event. It stemmed from when he was doing a job and a light tree did not have the outrigger legs secured properly, and it crumbled down on top of his leg.  After that injury he was on blood thinners, but apparently whatever happened, he was OK afterwards. At least for a while. Then two years ago, while I was out Christmas shopping (this is one of those things where you remember where you were when you got the call) I get a call from my wife that he has called our house and wanted to say hello, but my wife was telling me to call him right away because he didn't sound right.  I call him back later that evening, and something has happened - he can't carry a conversation, he can't complete a thought, and so on.  Since, I have gotten to visit him a couple times, once at his place, and he and his wife traveled up to here and I got to visit then. But recently, his wife shared that he's losing coherency, not recognizing her, and stuff like that. Basically, he is about gone, and it makes me so sad to see someone who I admired so much and was - in my younger mind - what I wanted to grow up to be, withering away.  I want to talk to him, but there's really not much of a conversation. I can only ask so many yes/no questions about things he can answer like the weather, the dog, etc.

This is probably way too long, and perhaps a bit o/t, but let me leave you with this -- if there's someone in your life that you saw or looked up to as a mentor, a friend, a crazy uncle you wish was actually your uncle, tell them how much of an impact they have had on you.

And if you're the old guy, and you've got folks you work with and you're training them, know how much your style, your actions, your ""vibe"" is being picked up by the younger ones."

First of all, I didn't use any of your songs, but thanks for sharing, great stuff in there.

So, played some funk as a warm up, people came in, ate a bit at the buffet and had a drink. Some girls started on the pole, which was right in front of me :D 

Pretty soon people got semi undressed, and nearly all women were in their undies. I just hammered the new popular stuff. Everyone got to vote on their favorites hotter people, both guys and girls. Played 'You can leave your hat on'. Some did.

I then switched up all genres, old and new. The dance floor was fluctuating a lot as people went upstairs, then came back. The boss took on after me and I danced with a girl.

Lots of rooms upstairs, beds, red lights, showers. And of course, people fucking everywhere.

Came back, played mixed up again, RnB, French, ragga, classics, news, whatever. All in all I did pretty much as I would have for any other night, as someone advised me rightly in pm.

It was winding down towards 2am. Most everyone was at it in the bedrooms so I put on a playlist and did dive in. I left at 4.

10/10 would do again. I'm booked for the next one.

I've created a website that extracts audio stems from songs using Spleeter, Demucs3, and Open Unmix. I've tried to provide as many options for each tool as possible. All tracks are always free to download with no sign-up. I'm running the server on a personal computer, as a personal project, so I'm unsure as to how it will scale with users. The processing depends on which Models you use, spleeter tends to take a minute or two, Demucs3 can take up to 10 minutes to finish processing, and Open Unmix completes in under 5 minutes.

649,Why high schoolers are hard to please,173,DJs,62,"There have been a few posts in the past about why it sucks to play high school dances and other events for teenagers.  I have done quite a few high school dances with great success but, I have access to what many others don't... three teenage daughters.  These three girls have wildly varying tastes in music but, they are a wealth of information for me.  I don't generally ask them outright about what music they like, but I instead listen for what they are listening to in their rooms, or I take a look at our rhapsody account to see what is getting played.

By and large, these kids will only listen to what is currently hot in any genre that they choose to listen to.  They also don't listen to much EDM except for the stuff being played on the radio.  And yes, I have caught all three of them playing levels over and over again.

This was further evidenced by a statement that my daughter made today concerning her prom.  When I asked her how it went, she said the prom was good but, the music ""sucked because the DJ kept playing stuff from 2010"".  She said the dance floor was at best moderately packed all night.  

Her statement is very telling.  When playing in bars and clubs, We as DJs, can get away with dropping music from a wide variety of time periods because adults have experienced music from a wide variety of time periods.  

Kids on the other hand don't begin to develop their own musical identity until around the onset of puberty.  Before that, the music they hear is largely controlled by those people around them.  When you look back on your life, chances are, you will associate a soundtrack to go with those memories.  Music makes and enhances memories.  

To teenagers, those memories are being made right now in the moment.  They correlate music with new and exciting experiences that are happening to them now.  Music that happened even just a couple years back is not ""their"" music.  To them, those are somebody else's memories.  Of course, there are exceptions.  I can still fill a dance floor with California Love or Lil John's ""Get Low"" but by and large, I only play music less than a year old.  I have never once received a request for the Black Eyed Peas, S&M by Rihanna, or anything else hot just a couple years ago at a high school dance.

So, go into these gigs with an open mind, and don't get caught up in trying to play what you consider to be ""good music"".  Play popular music because to your audience, that is ""good music"".  By doing this, you would be helping these kids make memories that will last a lifetime and, you will also increase your bookings.  Also, go easy on the remixes and, a little scratching will make you DJ Royalty to these kids.

Using the app I can focus more on how I want the night to progress and my mixing skills rather than worrying about what songs to play next. Also, I have discovered that people make fewer song requests, and ask to skip songs during house parties, because songs with similar features are progressed gradually, so it flows a lot better, and things don‚Äôt feel out of place.

This is my first app, so feedback would be greatly appreciated. Also, not sure if this counts as self promotion because the app is minimally monetized with banner ads, most of it going towards server costs.

Long story short, I've loved music for as long as I can remember, my dad was a DJ when I was a kid so throughout my childhood I always had the equipment at home, the afternoon sessions my dad used to play to practice, helping him to organize cables and pack his stuff for his events.

I used to watch the Tomorrowland Aftermovies of 2015-16 and dreamt about one day being the big headliner.

I then moved to another country, grew up, and had to start working to make a living for myself and my little brother.

6 years later, I had a pretty good 6-figure income on marketing design working with 9-figure companies. And I was really good at it, huge companies would start competing to hire me.

And I really liked it - but it didn't make me happy. I wasn't passionate about it, I was just thrilled I was earning a good salary working 6 hours a day.

During the pandemic, I bought myself a DDJ-1000SRT to play at home and distract myself every now and then from work and not being able to go out.

Then, over a year ago, I was at a nightclub with some friends, and noticed the DJ that was playing sucked - he couldn't match any song the right way. My friends didn't notice cause they aren't DJs and honestly were kind of drunk, but I did - so I walk up to the manager of the place and asked him to play one day.

At this point, I had never played in front of an audience other than maybe 5-6 friends, I had no idea about DJing in a nightclub but I went with it.

He agreed - and 2 weeks later gave me the opportunity to play for about an hour.

Clearly, I sucked - but I loved the feeling, so I kept on practicing every day with my DDJ-1000.

Eventually, a few months later, I started playing at the biggest nightclubs in my town - and people loved it when I had to play - the nightclub would get 50-60+ extra people when they hired me.

And as I practiced more and more, I came across more and more music ‚Äì until eventually, feel in love with melodic techno.

For months, we would just sit in my living room with my friends, smoke weed, and listen to melodic techno mixes all night.

But there aren't nightclubs for melodic techno in my town, not even techno in general ‚Äì maybe a few for electronic music in general but that's about it.

There was only 1 festival in my town for this kind of music, so I got my tickets, went with my friends and... hated it. It was the worst organization I've ever seen in my life for an event.

I'm not going into details, but yeah, it was terrible.

What surprised me even more was that, my town is not that small. There are 6 million people living here, and techno has become extremely mainstream in the last few months mostly because of the Afterlife hype - so, where are all the events? The nightclubs? The festivals?

What about... if I started organizing REALLY good techno events? Not raves, more like Cercle (if you haven't seen them, go on YouTube and you'll get the idea).

Bring 500-600 people to a really iconic place during sunset, and play some great electronic and techno music.

No fancy scenario, not an abandoned factory - but beautiful, iconic venues.

So I started to look into it, and decided to organize my first event.

Rather quickly I noticed it wasn't as easy as I thought it was - putting together an event is A LOT of work. More than anything I've ever had to do in my marketing career.

BUT I LOVED IT!!!

I enjoyed every challenge, every tough conversation, every obstacle.

And I knew at that point, that was what I wanted to do.

So I quit my 6-figure marketing job to become an event producer of my own events, in the most iconic places of my country.

And the first one is this Saturday, right next to the biggest pyramid in the world (and nope, it's not Giza in Egypt, look it up on Wikipedia... ;)

It's a venue for up to 100 people - and we have a waiting list.

This is - by far - the riskiest decision I've ever made (I'm 24 y/o so I don't have THAT many but still lol), and I feel happy with it.

Just wanted to tell this story to people like you guys, who would understand what it means to feel passion for music, not just 'I like music'.

And let's see where this takes me.

685,"Most random last-minute gig I've ever taken, probably the most fun I've ever played, got paid WAY too much",165,DJs,52,"I got a call last Thursday night from a mother saying she was desperate. Her 18-year-old daughter was having her graduation party the next night and the DJ they lined up unexpectedly backed out on the gig. She had made a few calls to other DJs but they said they weren't comfortable taking such specific requests. She got my name from a friend and said I'm her only hope. At this point I'm thinking there's no way I'm taking it based on that info alone, but I told her to lay out the details and we'll talk. Here are the specifics:

- 500-600 people in attendance
- Everybody will want to dance the entire night
- There will be an equal mix of family and friends

Sounds reasonable so far...

- All of the family is Lebanese
- They want Lebanese music (um...)
- They will provide said Lebanese music (eh...)
- They want me from 8pm-1am (I'm thinking, here's where they tell me they have a $150 budget)
- Nope. They will pay me $1,000 cash

Deal for real!! The mom was beyond thankful. 

I got set up by 7:30 and was handed a book of Lebanese CDs with a printout of when to play each track. More directions: if there are kids who want modern music, play it for them. Take any and all request. Aye aye, ma'am. 

8:00 rolls around and I'm greeted by at least 100 people between the ages of 5 and 15, ready to dance. Following them are 5 middle-aged women carrying plates full of food, all of it for me. I'm stuffing my face... everything was exotic and amazing. No clue what any of it was called. Lots of chicken and sauces and hummus and fried deliciousness... God I'm salivating just thinking about it.

By 9:00 I've played only modern music for the kids, including songs from their phones--take the AUX cord, kid. I couldn't have cared less. The dance floor is starting to really fill up with older kids and adults. It's time for the Lebanese music.

I hit play on this one song and immediately the place erupts. 200 people start doing a ""dabke"" dance and loving every second of it. I play 10 of these in a row and every song is a huge hit. Sweaty, laughing people everywhere. By 11:00 there had to be 400 people on this dance floor. Even the American kids are getting down and trying to learn the steps. After a while I start to mix in some American music and I can do no wrong. Everybody was having the time of their life. I'm everyone's best friend at this party. One uncle practically wanted my autograph.

It goes like this until 1 and I'm notified I need to cut the sound. The mom approaches me with the biggest smile on her face and hands me an envelope. Thanks me for a solid 2 minutes saying I saved the party and the family has never had more fun. I pack up, get in my car, open the envelope... $2,000 cash. Un-fucking-believable!

I don't take many mobile gigs, especially last minute. There's no way I turn down that kind of cash, but had I known how great it turned out I would have done it for $150, no question. I hope I get a chance to do many more parties for them. Those people reminded me why I do what I do. "

Apparently the owner has told them that I will give them a set, and decide whether they can play more regularly. Considering I seem to be the only EDM DJ around, and playing for 8 hours a night is exhausting, I take them up on their offer.

""What decks do you use?"" I ask tentatively.

""Oh, we just use our laptops...""

*sigh*

""Of course you do..."" At this point I'm already somewhat indifferent, yet I further the conversation, jumping to an understandable conclusion, ""Are you using Virtual DJ?"".

""Nah, man; we're using Windows Media Player.""

Windows. Media. Player.

Not only can these guys not be arsed to learn a ""DJ"" program as simple as VDJ, but they can't even use a decent media player, instead choosing to go with whatever came stock: ""Hey, bro! Our new DJ laptop totally just arrived, dudebro! I'm not sure what software to use, broman brosefstein,  but it looks like this Windows Media Player came pre-loaded! Score, bro bro macbroferton!""

Fucking fuck.

So, against my better judgement, I decided to let them play for an hour. There was no hint of mixing. They literally played one track after the other, with a pause in-between as they furiously double-clicked to the next track. 

But hey, most people don't give a shit as long as you drop Levels, which they did. Three times. In an hour. So at least they had a bit of a crowd going.

Their crowning achievement, however, was not their pre-planned Media Player playlist (which actually made their presence behind the laptop completely moot), but rather the fact that they were using my mixer to ""mix"" the EQ - one of the guys even had my headphones on.

Am I angry that they used my stuff without even asking? 

Well, I guess I would be, if any of it had even been switched on...

That's right. They were using my EQ, and could not tell that it was doing NOTHING. And, for some reason, they were using my headphones, through which nothing was playing but total silence. 

Wut?

But wait there's more:

They expect to get paid. 

They expect to get paid more than me.

Hold the fucking phone.

I don't think I have ever been so insulted in my entire life.

Club owners/managers/etc, always pay your DJ, and pay them well. People always seem to get confused when it comes to paying the DJ, making excuses as to why they should get less money, and so on. The fact is, you are not paying for the one, two, three-hour set the DJ plays, you are paying for their **experience** - you are paying them for the hours and hours they spent practicing so that they could reach a point where they are able to hold a dancefloor. 

So please, tell me:

How in the ever-living fuck do these guys think they should get paid more than the resident DJ (who practices ""real mixing"" no less than two hours a day) for LITERALLY doing nothing but pressing play?

Again, this is really just a rant, so feel free to downvote and ignore, but I'd love to hear your stories to know I'm not the only one experiencing this sort of bullshit.

TL;DR: Guys want to play at my club. Guys have one laptop. Guys use Windows Media Player. Guys expect to be paid more than me, the resident DJ. Fuck those guys.

A bit about of my dj path: I am a female artist, who started djing around 2,5-3 years ago, after I moved to Berlin my career looked to be quite promising, for 1 year living here I played at almost all biggest clubs including Tresor, often being in line ups with big names and became a resident of the one of the most popular radio stations of underground electronic music. I dont have an agent or agency, but would love to have since its really hard to find regular gigs by yourself. I consider myself as quite strong dj with my own sound, I am playing both vinyl and digital, recently also started producing my own music. Despite I am staying for the quality, always responsible and well prepared for gigs, playing unreleases and rare tracks, I still have 1 gig per month and my career doesnt seem to move forward. Seems that people simply dont care about you and your music if you dont have a big name or are not an influencer/fake dj with big audience in instagram. I dont party too often and not so good at social connections, but for 1 year living in Berlin I got some good contacts though. I feel very frustrated since last time I am getting a lot of requests for recording podcasts that people often skip and dont listen, but not real bookings at the clubs. I feel injustice because my efforts are much bigger than the outcome I am getting. Next year I am releasing my first track, but I am so unmotivated and desperate, that I even think to quit everything connected to music‚Ä¶however I know its my path and I sincerely love it.

I have been a DJ since 1998 and have been in IT (it's my day job) since 2009. I was wondering if y'all think there would be any benefit to starting a series (probably on YouTube) called IT for DJs given how inextricably linked these things are in today's DJ world.

The primary purpose of the series would be to discuss common IT ""stuff"" but to analyze the available data and metrics through the DJ lens and with DJ requirements in mind in an approachable way. An example topic would be SSD vs. HDD, so here's a few bullet points that might be discussed (partial list):

* What's the difference?
* Durability
* Speed (whether or not the highest-end SSD is required)
* Form factors (e.g. NVMe/2.5"")

I know lots of DJs are *also* in IT or have technology backgrounds, so I'm hardly rare, but I think there's also a ton of DJs out there who also aren't and the litany of data out there about how to select things can be hard to wade through.

I would want to be careful about providing *opinions* and focus on *just the data*, though there's no way a series like this will happen without me providing an opinion or two along the way, but I will do my best to provide balanced and fair views.

Assuming I can put together engaging videos, do you think there's value in this? And if so, what kind of topics would you like to see?

TIA."

For a $3500 mixer, it‚Äôs a complete piece of shit. There is literally no excuse for the build quality on these units being so bad and them somehow being the standard at nearly every club in the world. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on CDJ firmware updates and Rekordbox updates not aligning. Pioneer needs to clean house over there and start running some serious quality control and compatibility tests on their gear, because every DJ i know complains about the same shit. 

I would love if Denon became the industry standard, from the limited amount I‚Äôve used their gear it seems like they‚Äôre a better version of Pioneer, but only Dutch DJ‚Äôs use them.

Finally we got a text that showed our set times, I was playing 12-1am. I was pretty excited I was playing a late time and made sure I was prepared music wise. I downloaded popular Spanish music since it was Cinco and I also filled my crate with hip hop to get the crowd dancing. 

Long story short, I start playing. I‚Äôm nervous as HELL as all the other djs are kinda surrounding me. I felt like I had a lot to prove, especially since I was playing a 12am set. I‚Äôm not sure what the dj before me pressed but he had it to where I was playing on different channels that I‚Äôm not used to so I was so confused. 

It was a mess, I accidentally played the song back to back and not even 3 mins in the main dj pulled me off. She looked at me so annoyed and started getting another laptop out. 

I understood bc of how I was starting off but I wish she would‚Äôve gave me time to fix my controller and gather myself together. She didn‚Äôt give me a chance or ask ‚Äúhey what‚Äôs up?? Is everything good?‚Äù lol 

She proceeded to say ‚Äúyou obviously aren‚Äôt ready to dj, just because you‚Äôre pretty doesn‚Äôt mean you can just come in here and play. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing‚Äù 

I was heated. I didn‚Äôt even get the chance to play and redeem myself! üò≠

I was so upset and started beating myself up about it. I was embarrassed and humiliated in front of my friends and the other djs. I quickly starting spiraling into a pit and kept hearing her voice in my head. 

Thankfully I have a lot of dj friends and they reminded me to take this as a learning experience and to come back 10x harder. Djing takes practice and failed attempts. 

From this experience I learned that I need to learn my controller so the next time something happens I‚Äôm not confused. I also realized I need to develop thicker skin lol. 

I‚Äôm still pretty upset about it but I plan to keep going. I know I can be great, just gotta practice. 

I hope to look at this a year from now and smile with how much I‚Äôve grown.

I‚Äôm 27 days sober. After taking a break from booking gigs for awhile, last night I performed one of my first sober DJ sets in a club for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôm thankful for not feeling like shit this morning but also feel really anxious that I just wasn‚Äôt really feeling the vibe last night. Finding my creative ‚Äòflow state‚Äô while sober has been an ongoing challenge due to alcohol being paired with mixing for nearly 2 decades. It was at a big club that I haven‚Äôt played at before and they had one of those massive video walls right behind the booth like you find at EDM festivals. The crowd was also way more EDM than what I normally play to and it all just felt off. I personally hate when us DJs are stuck on a stage with a huge backdrop and people just stand in that direction like it‚Äôs a concert. It‚Äôs not my style or preference, and I felt bad for the friends and fans who came out to hear what I normally play. I‚Äôve been in my head about it since last night and keep fearing that maybe ‚ÄòI‚Äôve lost it‚Äô musically now that I‚Äôm sober.

I actually just showed my lady the old clip of [David Guetta‚Äôs ‚Äòmeltdown‚Äô](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mMFDxuh1zQo) to explain how it felt.

Anyway, everyone had positive things to say but I just wasn‚Äôt feeling it and maybe it‚Äôs all in my head. Time will tell. I hope it was just a weird night since I‚Äôm looking forward to exploring a sober flow state. Cheers."

I'm in the process of launching a new online radio statio and looking for anyone that wants to take part, if you want to set, play a prerecorded set thats all good.

Not matter your skill set, what genre you play we want to hear from you.

The main idea behind this new station is to promote djs and help to get their name - music out there. I want to create a fun loving community among djs and producers, a place where people can come and showcase their talent no matter the skill set even if youve just started or been at it for years, a place to get feedback and just enjoy music from any genre. 

It's will cost you nothing to join all I ask is for you to promote us and in return I will do the same on all of our social media, you will also get your own page with bio information contact number and links for your own social networks, music images anything you want to share.

About me and why to join.
I‚Äôve been a dj from the early 90s playing break beat and slowly moved to trance and house, I‚Äôve hosted a successful radio station 10 years ago but due to time commitments and having children it fadded away. Now my kids have grown up I‚Äôve got back in to it and started doing live Facebook streams but the trouble with Facebook its copyright and getting streams taken down or cut of half way through.
Get in touch with your thoughts and how to get involved. The new station I hope to get up and running the next couple of weeks. I want to djs to be in control and play when they want not just set times. 

Divine Rhythms will be the new name. Thanks for reading I hope to hear back from you soon

UPDATE

After a lot of set backs the site is finally up but looking very bare , shot me over links to any mixes and I'll begin adding them 

Thanks everyone I'm getting really excited about this

Been at my current bar residency for about 6 and a half years through at least 4 different GMs. Over that time I've played on similar themes with variations according to trend. Open format - mainly commerical and classics from House and RnB with some UKG, DnB, Dancehall, Grime, Afrobeats, 90s/00s dancy cheese etc depending on the crowd and the night.

Always busy, always a good dancefloor and happy customers on the whole.

Last weekend we had a visit from senior management who are now suddenly unhappy with what I am doing. Whilst playing Single Ladies I was ordered to play some girly music. Whilst playing some House I was ordered to cut the record and immediately play some spice girls. I declined and was threatened with 'we pay your wages so do it'. I declined again. For the last hour I was ordered to play music that people can sing to but not dance to. Wtf?

Speaking with the manager the next day he was told to fire me. He refused. But apparently I will have to shift what I play to be what they deem girly pop - Abba, Spice Girls, Arianna Grande, Little Mix etc  - no remixes and the like. This will now be the main music focus for the night.

If they want to change the music then I understand completely; that's their call. But I wish to be treated as a professional, not like the dirt they spoke to me like. An actual professional to professional discussion and maybe we could have arrived at something workable. They way I was spoken to annoyed me for the rest of the night.

Anyway that music change carries no interest to me at all and whilst its a bit of a financial hit and I will miss performing, I'm thinking about calling it a day there with immediate effect.

Others are telling me I'm being too rash and to stick it out."

773,I don't think I'll be getting a CDJ-3000 anytime soon.,154,DJs,109," Alright so I've gone through the CDJ-3000 release documentation and here are my thoughts on the new CDJ-3000.

Background:  I've been DJing since 2009.  I adopted Virtual DJ back when it was a pile of ass and got on Serato ITCH when I got my first controller the Numark V7.  I currently own a pair of CDJ-2000 NXS.  I use them primarily as Serato controllers and occasionally run USB sticks.  So for me, the jump to a pair of CDJ-3000 would have to justify a $4600 investment.

The jump from CDJ1000MK3 to CDJ-2000 was massive.  HID support, digital libraries, record box, etc.  It meant more possibilities and more flexibility in DJ performances.  This was a must-have upgrade.

The jump from CDJ2000 to NXS and NXS2 is more subtle but still game-changing.  Better processing meant less buffering.  Touch screens and more controls provided even more flexibility.  Larger and larger screens for easier tracking.  But unlike the 1000-2000 jump, these revisions were not essential.  The CDJ-2000 operated very similarly to the NXS and NXS2.  There are quality of life improvements but they were basically interchangeable.

Now that the CDJ-3000 launched, I was expecting something similar to the CDJ1000-2000 jump.  Improvements that are so good that DJ's can't live without it.  But unfortunately, I don't think that is the case.  Let me explain why.

I bought a CDJ-2000 NXS because I wanted to be familiar with this generation of CDJ players while also being able to leverage my computer for sets.  I avoided the CDJ1000MK3 because it was effectively a different machine.  Learning and playing on that would be a waste of time.  This warranted the price tag of the CDJ2000NXS.

The CDJ-3000 is effectively a CDJ2000 NXS2 with a 9"" touchscreen instead of a 7"" touch screen.  They tout improvements in their audio DAC hardware but from the CDJ2000 on we've been able to play WAV and FLACC files and the sound quality was very high.  Considering that these units are not studio recording devices and club systems are inherently messy in their signal to noise ratio, this improvement will likely be undetectable.

The ability to run 6 CDJ-3000's at the same time, although impressive, is wildly impracticable.  I've rarely seen performers use 4 decks at the same time let alone 6.  Unless your set-up REQUIRES 6 decks, this feature will never be used.

The added hot cues buttons are nice but the CDJ2000 line already has 3/4 hot cue buttons.  An extra 2 is not a deal-breaker.

A lot of the features stated on the official website are already things that the CDJ2000 line can do.  Advanced Looping, Lossless file types, DJ Link (You just need to run Rekordbox to use this), Key Sync and Shift, etc.

Honestly, the main advantage of the CDJ-3000 is the 9"" touchscreen.  It can display overlapping and 3Band waveforms.  But if you use a computer at all with this system it's pretty redundant as your computer will display this info better and clearer.  This is a nice feature for USB only DJ's but the CDJ2000 line already has overlapping beat indicators that effectively do the same thing.

The other thing that it has is robustness.  The locking power cord is a well-needed feature for clumsy DJs and the metal construction is a nice touch.  But it doesn't change how a DJ interacts with the device.

They also removed the CD drive.  Normally I wouldn't care as CD DJ's are not common but it does bring up the question of the XDJ-1000 platform.  The XDJ platform was considerably less expensive than the CDJ2000NXS and yet the CDJ-3000 is priced in a similar range as the CDJ2000NXS2 and not the XDJ-1000MK2.  This is likely due to the improved construction but a $1000 difference is pretty steep.

All of this is to say that I'm not going to be replacing my CDJ2000NXS with these anytime soon.  A near $5000 investment for a CDJ2000NXS with a nicer screen and metal faceplate is just not worth it for me.

Here's my suggestion for anyone looking at buying pioneer equipment right now.

\- If you NEED the CD slot, pick up a used CDJ200 - CDJ2000NXS2  They'll be more cost-effective and give you a similar experience

\- If you are starting out and buying your first DJ equipment, get a DDJ-1000 controller.  2 platters plus a mixer for 1/2 the cost of ONE CDJ-3000.  Plus when you hook it up to a laptop with Pioneer Reckordbox it'll perform pretty much the same.

\- If you are using USB sticks, buy the XDJ1000-MK2.  It's half the price of the CDJ3000 and even has a 7"" touch screen.

Considering that Denon offers a similar product with more features $1000 less than the CDJ3000 I think Pioneer is banking on the inertia of their Club DJ standard status to drive sales.

I can't wait to read a DJ rider that request 6 DJ3000's and a pioneer V10 mixer just so they can look cool and play on barely 3 decks.

TLDR: Meh, not worth the replacement."
774,Who here DJs recreationally and not for financial gain?,150,DJs,102,"I‚Äôve dabbled in DJing since college. 32 now. Back in the day, we‚Äôd have house parties where a few of us would play and just enjoy each other‚Äôs company. Someone would bring a pair of 1200s, a mixer, Serato SL1, and a laptop and we‚Äôd just do drugs and jam out. 

I‚Äôve since grown up, got a professional degree, earned some real money, and bought a house. Since I have a den (i.e. man cave) now, I finally have the space and the means to get whatever I want. I have a desktop hooked up to a controller (DDJ SR2) and I like to fuck around with it few times a week. I also spend about $100-200/month buying specific tracks I like in order the fuel the hobby. It makes me happy. 

Anyone else do this strictly for enjoyment? Most people here are hustling or worrying about gigs and I‚Äôm just here in my little den. My wife thinks it‚Äôs a bit immature but I suppose it‚Äôs a little better than just playing games all day?

778,"If you value Customer Service, NEVER buy a Denon DJ Product.",154,DJs,81,"I dearly enjoyed using my Denon Prime 4, having upgraded from a DDJ-SR, the All-in-one 4-Channel deck was a beast by comparison. Unfortunately one of the LCD jogwheel screens went kaput while I was transferring music to the Internal Hard Drive. I only had it for maybe two months of ownership by this point, so I decided to proceed with an RMA to get it fixed. I wholeheartedly regret that decision right now. 

So I made [this forum post](https://denondjforum.com/t/another-victim-of-jog-wheel-display-crashing-also-my-1-4-is-stuck-in-mic-input/23190) over two months ago before deciding to go through with an RMA. I was waiting to see if I could get any input from an Admin or Staff member but literally zero members reached out to me. Check the comment section and only a few other users gave their two cents on what to do. I made [this thread on /r/DenonPrime](https://old.reddit.com/r/DenonPrime/comments/hbmww9/well_shit/) to maybe get some extra feedback but they all said to contact support.

So I head over to the support page and [filled out this form](https://www.denondj.com/support). I waited over a week with zero response back to my email or phone number so I decided to fill out the form again and send another request. Another week goes by without any response, so I decided to call the Phone Number on the [right hand of the page](https://www.denondj.com/support). Some dude called Al immediately picked up (immediate is emphasized, we'll explain why later) and apologized for the emails that haven't been answered. He provided me with the Packing Slip and RMA number and I officially dropped it off at [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/apps/fedextrack/?tracknumbers=770903842361) on July 14th, where it was delivered a week later on July 21st. 

After two entire weeks of being at the Warehouse I haven't received any calls or emails regarding a status update of my RMA. Remember how I said when Al picked up it was immediate? Every subsequent call I made since my unit has been at the warehouse, I have been placed on hold for over 40 minutes before speaking to someone. Even going as long as [more than an hour](https://i.imgur.com/S2a0d4G.jpg). The first person I managed to get in contact with, dudes name was Sam, told me that my unit was actually getting ready to be shipped back later today! Great! I asked him for a tracking number and he said he would email it to me later in the day. A whole ass day goes by with no response. I call back, wait like 40 minutes on hold, then a man named Nick picks up the phone. He puts me on another 20 minute hold to inquire wtf was going on and why it was taking so long to find a damn tracking number. Turns out Sam from yesterday was lying! My Prime 4 was scheduled to be replaced but they did not have any stock at all in the warehouse so instead they ordered a replacement piece to try and repair my unit instead (which I would've preferred in the first place because if you browse the forums you would know this is somewhat of a common issue). But basically Sam lied about the unit being shipped out and now I have to wait possibly another week while they start to fix my damn controller.

I tried going to the Official Facebook Group to see someone could help me out there. The page said to [DM them.](https://i.imgur.com/9p1F541.jpg) I copied and pasted my original post into their message board. Guess what? [They never replied.](https://i.imgur.com/NuBdJH4.png)

A week and a half later, still no status updates, I decided to call back (this is August 25th, yesterday of this post and over one month since the unit has been at their warehouse). A man named Jesus answers and tells me that the unit is actually getting shipped out later today! Great! Can I have a tracking number please?! ""I'll call you right back with that information later today chief""... Surprise, Surprise. I never got called back.

So about 10 minutes before I started writing this lengthy post furiously, I called back and got in contact with another guy (forgot his name, hard to keep track at this point) and he tells me after a brief hold that the warehouse was unable to repair my unit and they were planning to replace the unit but after one entire fucking month **THEY STILL DON'T HAVE ANY STOCK IN THE WAREHOUSE**.

TL;DR: So just to recap, Denon refused to reply to me on their official forums, Ignored their emails, never sent me status updates of my $1,800 unit in their possession, **LIED TO ME TWICE ABOUT SHIPPING MY UNIT BACK TO ME**, and are now over their promised ""2-4 week turnaround"" policy. 

The thing is, I genuinely enjoy what Denon DJ is trying to accomplish as the underdog in a market that's been almost entirely monopolized by Pioneer for the last two decades. Their products are genuinely innovating, and while I had my Prime 4 I had various other fellow DJ's tell me that they were seriously impressed by the gear. It wasn't perfect but it was a step above in feature sets what any comparable Pioneer unit has to offer at a more competitive price point. This Customer Service sham needs to be addressed faster than Prime Engine OS was because this shit is meaningless if they can't promise to hold customers faith for their semi-unreliable hardware mishaps. 

I just want to get my controller back already and spin some epic releases that came out in this packed month. Thank you for reading, feel free to share for exposure.



*UPDATE*: A few hours after this was posted, an InMusic Brands Manager told me a replacement unit was being shipped out within two business days at the expense of it being a B-Stock (refurbished) model. Fortunately, aside from some scratches that are only visible in direct light, the replacement is working perfectly and looks great! Although I could've sworn the gray knobs had a little bit more of a heavier feel to them. This replacement unit makes it feel like they are very light, but that's no concern. I'm just glad to be spinning on a Prime 4 again. I hope Denon's RMA process from here on out becomes a smoother experience going forward. 

It is important to mention that two other people in this thread have reported the exact same issue that caused me to RMA my original unit in the first place. You can read about that [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ih2hwx/if_you_value_customer_service_never_buy_a_denon/g2xo40p/) and [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ih2hwx/if_you_value_customer_service_never_buy_a_denon/g30adb1/). This was not an isolated incident and I'm praying that my replacement model does not suffer the same fate. I hope Denon can find a solution for this issue because not having that jog wheel display working makes it more tedious for me to switch between Decks 2 & 4 and automatically know what song is loaded on said decks. Hopefully they manage to get a more reliable Power Supply Unit manufactured for the jogwheel displays."

791,A guide to organize independent parties: is it a good idea?,152,DJs,96,"I wanted to write a guide to help DJs organizing their own parties with almost no budget (In some public spaces like bars and restaurants).

That can sound dumb but when I was younger I thought it was a really big deal to organize parties.

After running some independent ones when I was in University, I figured out it was worth the effort and also a way to earn some money.

What do you think about the idea?

EDIT: Here is the guide

This post concerns all the DJs who wish to organize parties but never took action because of a lack of opportunity, fear, or imposter syndrome. I wrote it after organizing 10+ independent house and techno events on my campus in a Swedish city when I was studying for my Master's. 

I didn‚Äôt speak the language, we didn‚Äôt really have money, and I had weak DJ skills. 

However, we managed to find an opportunity, we caught it, and we figured out it was not as complicated as we thought. 

This is why I am sharing it with you right now (and also because I want to promote Lesk, I won‚Äôt lie).

**1) Ask people around you**

Ask your friends or connections‚Ä¶

...if they want to organize events too. It‚Äôs a funny activity, you can eventually start earning money and it makes you a cool/active person. 

The first and easiest step to do is to ask among your friends and/or to post a story on social media. ‚ÄúWho would start an organization for making parties‚Äù and you would be impressed by the number of people ready to do something.

If your close friends are not really up for that, start asking people around you that can be interested. Maybe at your school, work, university and so on. As this is work as well a passion, you don‚Äôt have to be friends with the people you‚Äôre organizing something. 

Keep in mind that you should at least have compatible tastes for music. Once you have found people, you can start motivating each other.

2) **Connect with local artists and local party people.** 

Start connecting with local party people to localize opportunities‚Ä¶ 

...send messages to see if you can connect or help them to organize events. If you are ready to work for free to get experience, you will start meeting people. Then, you will make connections and see opportunities everywhere.

Once you start frequenting those people, you will be in the world of party organizing. There, you will understand how everything works. More opportunities will pop up. The people you frequented might even help you organize other things.

DJs and promoters often have tons of ideas and tasks to do. If you help them to accomplish them, they might welcome you. Be careful, do not transform yourself into a slave. If you don‚Äôt find your pleasure in helping people, don‚Äôt. This is not the point.

The point is to get the contacts for artists, places, experiences, and anything worth taking.

3) **Create a ‚Äúfictive‚Äù proper concept**

Start ideating a concept or party you want to create‚Ä¶

...write it on a piece of paper. Show this to your friends to see if it makes sense and if people would come. Then, find a name generate some beautiful aesthetics. You can create a logo, fonts, colors, and most importantly, a poster. 

Finally, create your social media accounts that are useful, the ones where you can spread the word to the people you desire to invite.

You don‚Äôt need to be perfect. You need to exist, be understandable, be found, and be accessible. People need to project themselves into your event. Even if it‚Äôs not the reality yet.

Here, getting likes is not the goal. The goal is to show people that your thoughts start taking place.

To make it more professional, do not hesitate to generate your visuals with the help of Photoshop or Gimp tutorials. Or find free templates, you‚Äôll find plenty.

4) **Find a place to throw your party and negotiate a percentage**

There are plenty of restaurants or bars that have sound systems but have a hard time attracting customers. They are craving to make money. Then, organizing an event is a perfect way to do so.

If you know enough artists to perform, If you know how to spread the word to attract enough people then they might be interested in you. (and with social media it can be really easy)

The goal here is to organize an event and take a fee out of it. This fee can be the entrance ticket or a percentage of all the sales during the night.

Why is that better than a simple gig? Because of the purpose, you will create. The hype will be bigger, people will come for the atmosphere you will create and this is where you can do something bigger than the bar/restaurant owner.

Take your concept with you and visit the clubs, bars, and restaurants. Ask them if you can work together. If they reject you, this is normal. Just don‚Äôt forget that you need only one ‚ÄúYes‚Äù to organize your first party.

Be smart on the location you‚Äôre choosing, not too chic, not too far from people, something that makes sense.

Understand also which kind of place you‚Äôre dealing with. Sometimes, they already have people organizing events, and they don‚Äôt think you bring that much value. 

Sometimes, they regret their ancient time and would love someone to reactivate their old soul. In any case, you need to understand why they want to do business with you. It will let you know how big of a fee you can take.

5) **Manage people and artists**

Many local artists and people would love to promote their local scene, which means that you might find people interested in working with you...

...for artists, ask for their mixes and their style. Then, you will be able to understand the type of music they are playing. Depending on their energy, you will determine when they will play.

Understand which kind of energy they can bring depending on the place‚Äôs frequency.

Place the less skilled when people are not here and the most experienced when people are here, even if YOU are the least skilled.

For the people working with you, you will have to split the tasks. The best way to do so is to plan AHEAD.

If you‚Äôre leading, you will be the one organizing shifts and work. As you‚Äôre working with people, don‚Äôt forget that they might be late or lazy doing stuff. Prepare in advance and make them have an easy time while accomplishing it.

Understand why people are doing what they are doing. It will help you understand why they act the way they behave. 

Someone who wants to become the next David Guetta might tell you the day before he won‚Äôt come if he finds a better gig. 

Someone who wants to improve the local scene might help your competitors without seeing any problem. 

If you understand that, you will avoid problems in the future.

PS: Bring AT LEAST food and drinks to your crew and DJs. It doesn‚Äôt have to be fancy, it just needs to show that you have considered.

6) **Market your party**

To make your event credible, you will need to make several pieces of advertisement‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ You already created a poster, which is good, but come on, you can do better. 

Tell your story, make a video, a copy in addition and show people that it‚Äôs real. That your event will happen and that they should be hyped for that. It‚Äôs their blood boiling before entering the club that will make the difference.

Create a Facebook event and repost it in every group you can (the groups where people who are susceptible to come are part of).

Ask your friends to share the event. The merrier, the better. And mostly, it will make your event more credible.

Pay some Facebook ads as it‚Äôs very effective.

Post on Reddit or any social media that can convert people. 

Sometimes, people are craving for the type of party that you will organize. They might just don‚Äôt know that someone is playing around them. So you‚Äôre actually helping more than anything else.

7) **Prepare everything**

Normally, working with a bar or a restaurant will avoid all the regulations, all the permits, and so on. You won‚Äôt need to think of everything. But still, you should always ask for:

Fire = Normally, the owner has it covered if it‚Äôs a legal place. (And this is why it‚Äôs easier to choose a bar or a restaurant)

Security = Often, the owner pays someone when they have events. Ask in case.

The noise disturbance = Try to avoid cops coming in the middle of the party to shut down everything. Ask the owner.

Handle cash= Find ways to handle cash and be paid surely. Be able to give recipes too. Find a way to have a simple accounting. Depending on your country, you might not need to start something, but it‚Äôs better if you keep track of the future.

The wardrobe= Find someone YOU TRUST for the wardrobe. Ask the owner also. He might already work with people.

Understand the sound system of the place. Be ready for any problem and see if your DJs can plug themselves. Come several times the week before your event to be sure that everything is smooth.

Organize meetings with your crew to be on point = It helps people to structure and speak out on the project. The more you let people show implications, the happier they will be.

Come before and stay after the party. Help to organize the room. You will gain credibility. Be careful, do not do someone else's work.

Be easy to find. Nothing is more frustrating than not finding a party.

PS: here, if you have any other suggestions, I am down for getting them as we are never too careful.

8) **Throw your party, enjoy and repeat**

I applied this strategy when I was studying in Sweden. I started organizing parties from scratch in a country where I couldn‚Äôt even pronounce the alphabet. I also didn‚Äôt have good DJ skills by the time. I made lots of connections, got crazy memories with a lot of friends, and found my future wife. If it worked for me, it should work for you too.

If you want to know more about party organizing, we are creating content on our website [lesk.club](https://www.lesk.club/), don‚Äôt hesitate to check it out. And if you have any feedback, ideas or whatsoever we will be happy.

Other than that, I wish you good luck in your journey for DJing. "
792,"Played my first ""live"" b2b set with my partner last night, such a great experience!",153,DJs,29,"So my partner and I met through the dance community around 4 years ago, back then I was just some obscure underground DJ and she was a party promoter/entrepreneur who played a much bigger part in the local scene. We hit it off quickly and have been a dynamic duo in many ways since, but although we love all the same kinds of music, she never even considered trying to touch the decks herself for years until the pandemic hit. Now with 0 real creative social outlets, I've been slowly teaching her how to mix over the past several months, and last night we finally got to play in front of a live ""audience"" via a Twitch stream/zoom party to celebrate my birthday. It was only for a relatively small amount of close friends, maybe 20 people at it's peak, but we went for a solid 6 hours straight of proper back to back and she honestly killed it and got a ton of positive feedback from our pals, and now it's looking like we're going to become a DJ duo when we resume throwing events again eventually. Sorry if this post is just a fluffy humblebrag, but we're both still riding the high from having such a lengthy set go off so well and I wanted to share. 10/10 definitely recommend b2b DJ sessions for quality couple's bonding lol.

&#x200B;

\*Random edit 9 months later not that anyone will see it but we have now also gone on to play a weekly residency together for a local bar patio back in the summer time as well as some other decently big gigs like mini fests and a Halloween rave together as a back to back duo. So definitely a real duo now! :)

Energy, energy, energy.",151,DJs,39,"My first night was at a birthday party, the DJ was playing but the birthday girl didn‚Äôt like the type of music at all. Trap Hip Hop and she knew I just started DJing EDM. lol. Not at all - I had just bought a controller and watched some online videos for a few weeks. I was clueless and has never practiced for more than an hour doing transitions. 

So here she goes, ‚ÄúCan you please play some EDM, please?‚Äù Right after her best friend came to me and said ‚Äúshe really doesn‚Äôt like this...‚Äù 

Ok - Tomorrowland 1000 playlist - pick a banger here we go - find the next song in key and similar BMP - MOST IMPORTANT PART - know where need to start the song - the energy is never on the one and sometimes not even close to the beginning - ‚Äúfind where the energy of the song starts!!!‚Äù - cued it up - missed the transition - cued back, faded in at that point - right away with energy! 

After missing all my initial transition attempts and resorting to fading - I said to myself ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do this - you have no practice - it‚Äôs live and people are dancing - any mistake will kill the vibe. Just keep finding those energy points, where a strong rhythmic vocal comes in or the build begins or a vocal break in the build or an acapella section right before the next drop if the songs are similar for example and fade in right there! Just keep them moving!‚Äù 

Bam - 3 hours later - I felt defeated as a DJ - everyone congratulated me on an ‚Äúepic night‚Äù. At which point I revealed: ‚Äúguys, I didn‚Äôt do a single transition - just played song after song‚Äù, with a sad face. 

‚ÄúWell you played what we liked and it was a blast‚Äù. Then the compliments kept coming, this song that song was awesome. You‚Äôre sooo good. 

Not sure most people know the difference between a technical transition and one that is faded fast from energy to energy. 

I was shitting myself, for three hours I thought I was looked at like: look at this amateur, but we‚Äôre dancing. Meanwhile to them my ‚Äútransition were great!!!‚Äù LMAO 

Song selection and keep the ENERGY - non stop.

And find where the energy in the next song actually starts..."

Late 90's or early 00's.

Some friends were having a house party, I'd never been to their house but knew the neighborhood was pretty sketchy. They called me up and asked if I wanted to come down and spin some records.....and could I bring decks. I said sure WTF, they were cool guys, so I packed my stuff and headed out with a roommate in tow. Got setup in the basement at this huge old house and it was going great, sound system was decent and the party was popping. I was spinning booty/ghetto house and everyone was loving it. After maybe 20 minutes we all hear a big crashing sound coming from upstairs over the fairly loud music, everyone stopped and looked up towards the ceiling like ""WTF was that!"" Moments later someone runs down the stairs and says some gang banger type dudes pushed their way into the party.

The music is still playing and up walks this dude who was clearly not one of our crew. It's immediately clear that he may have never seen 1200's IRL before, he also seemed to enjoy the ghetto house I was playing. Dude looked fascinated. I was still actively DJing, trying to ignore this dude and not interact. He walks right up and makes his best attempt at scratching on the currently playing record from the crowd side of the DJ booth (I use the term very loosely) and I absolutely fucking let him. I had zero ideas about doing anything to stop this from happening, but after maybe 10 seconds of him moving the record back and forth he gave me a stone cold look....and walked away. 1 or 2 minutes later someone says to me ""they're robbing people upstairs, take your decks and get the fuck out of here."". Now everyone in the basement is like starting to panic a bit and frankly so was I, cuz it seemed like we were trapped. Thankfully some calm headed raver notes there is a door with stairs leading to the garage. It felt like a miracle, everyone *in the basement* was able to escape including me, my roommate and my gear. Unfortunately a few of my friends upstairs did get robbed and sucker punched, but otherwise were okay.

Anyone else got a ""wtf"" transition?"
813,Went to play at a club yesterday and was told this‚Ä¶.,145,DJs,152,"I‚Äôve been DJin for about 2 years now, I‚Äôm pretty familiar with all systems, they had a zone 96 which I‚Äôve played on at other clubs a lot. As I was doing sound check , only the owner and one resident dj was there, as I was transitioning into a song I turned the high hats down for a smoother transition, and that‚Äôs when the resident dj starts yelling at me in front of the owner saying ‚Äúyou never touch that knob, there is no need for it , all it does is turn the high hats down‚Äù and made me look like a fool in front of the owner. I was pretty in shock because I always use that. He said I only need to use the first three knobs. So im not sure why he would say that. Is this a common thing for people not to use that for the transitions? I mean I dj a lot and that just seemed so weird for him to say that as if unwashed doing something wrong. 

For reference on the xone 96 it‚Äôs the last knob on the channel before the volume."

822,Nye 2024 DJ gig kind of a flop,151,DJs,71,"So picture this: I‚Äôve been spinning tunes since lockdown‚Äîyeah, that infamous ‚ÄúC‚Äù period. Bagged a few gigs too: bar mitzvahs, corporate shindigs, you name it. Started the year on fire, scoring a New Year‚Äôs Eve gig at this swanky hookah joint in the heart of the city. How‚Äôd I land it? Well, I wowed the owners by mixing it up for some Indian clients who snagged their party room. They were all, ‚ÄúWe need this DJ for NYE and every Saturday after that!‚Äù

But hold your applause because here‚Äôs where the plot twist kicks in. A few days prior, I‚Äôm all proactive, asking about the vibe they want. They throw me a mixtape request: house, a sprinkle of Arabic tunes, and that thumping EDM for the big NYE bash. Sweet deal, right? Armed with Arabic hits, owner-approved tracks, and a stash of party bangers, I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúEasy peasy, this gig‚Äôs a breeze.‚Äù

Fast forward to showtime. Nine o‚Äôclock hits, and it‚Äôs a ghost town‚Äîno surprises there. So, I‚Äôm in my element, dropping house beats, spicing it up with Drake and Pitbull. And then, out of the blue, the owner‚Äôs missus drops the bomb: ‚ÄúOnly Arabic songs from now on.‚Äù Talk about a plot twist!

Now, the plot thickens. I‚Äôm there, spinning beats and sprinkling in some killer house remixes of Arabic tracks I dug up. Surprise, surprise‚Äîit turns out it‚Äôs Lebanese, not your standard Arabic fare. How could I tell? Well, newsflash: I‚Äôm not exactly from that neck of the woods. I‚Äôm a black Asian guy who, on occasion, gets mistaken for someone from the Middle East. And hey, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs why I snagged this gig in the first place!

But wait, there‚Äôs more awkwardness on the horizon. The owner throws a curveball and introduces me to their son, who‚Äôs itching to hop on the decks. He had to be about 10-12 in age. My initial thought? ‚ÄúCool, I‚Äôll school the lad a bit. Keep the kid happy, keep the clients happy‚Äîsimple, right?‚Äù Wrong. This mini-DJ maestro makes a beeline for the turntable while the music‚Äôs pumping and decides it‚Äôs knob-touching time. Cue the music halt, effects gone rogue, and a sea of eyes staring straight at me. What do I do? I crack up. I surrender, hit the air horn sound effect (because why not?), throw on another house track, and BAM! I get chewed out because apparently, DJ Khaled doesn‚Äôt pass for ‚ÄúArabic‚Äù in this scenario. Go figure.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: a squad of 15 college white kids‚Äîmy saving grace. No dance floor in sight, just tables and hookah everywhere. So, what do I do? I work my magic, drop some sick house beats, and guess what? Those kids start grooving. Picture this: chairs become impromptu dance stages, folks shimmying around tables with hookahs in tow. Who needs a dance floor when you‚Äôve got a crowd turning their seats into boogie zones?

Alright, buckle up for the whirlwind: I scan the room, and about 15 to 20 folks are sporting the classic stank face. Seems they‚Äôre on a strict ‚ÄúArabic music only‚Äù diet. So, I reluctantly transform into a human playlist, just hitting play on the owner‚Äôs 30-minute Arabic song collection. I‚Äôve got a 5-hour gig ahead of me‚Ä¶ oh boy.

Plot twist! As I dive into the Arabic playlist, a wild card appears‚Äîa belly dancer takes the stage. Jackpot, right? I focus on her, hoping for a distraction. But guess what? She sashays over and requests more Arabic tunes. I panic‚ÄîI‚Äôm tapped out on my Arabic stash. Turns out, she‚Äôs not even Arabic herself; she‚Äôs Puerto Rican. Go figure! We share a laugh about the confusion. Then she drops the bomb: the music I played before was üî•. Sadly, the truth stings‚Äîeveryone else here only wants Arabic beats, confirmed by the belly dancer.

Meanwhile, just a week earlier, the owners clearly (and I mean, in text message clarity) told me to switch it up between Arabic and American tunes. Well, guess that memo got lost in translation.

So, here‚Äôs the cherry on top of this madness cake: the owner‚Äôs mini-me decides it‚Äôs prime time to turn my DJ booth into a theme park. Picture this: I‚Äôm in the zone, trying to craft sonic miracles, when suddenly, I feel this incessant tapping on my shoulder. Who‚Äôs the culprit? The owner‚Äôs kid. And what does this tyke want? Sigma music and Eminem. Because, sure, why not turn the DJ booth into a jukebox, right?

But wait, there‚Äôs more! This kid doesn‚Äôt stop there. Oh no, he bolts off, only to return wielding a laptop like it‚Äôs Excalibur. He plonks it down next to my DJ setup, desperate to flaunt his Fortnite skin collection. I‚Äôm thinking, ‚ÄúIs this a DJ set or a tech demo for Fortnite cosplay?‚Äù

I‚Äôm over here, trying to mix tracks for dear life, and suddenly I‚Äôve got a DJ battle with an eager Fortnite warrior. Reality check: this can‚Äôt possibly be happening, but oh yes, it is.

Ah, the perfect storm meets an unexpected reunion! Picture this: my high school buddies, long lost in the sands of time, suddenly emerge at the hookah bar Armageddon. Shots are flying, jokes are crackling over the mic, and we‚Äôre there, conducting the countdown like it‚Äôs our own private New Year‚Äôs Eve shindig. Cheers to the new year, right?

Now, let‚Äôs address the elephant in the DJ booth‚Äîthe gig was a glorious train wreck. But hey, silver lining alert: I pocketed the full payment and a hefty $20 tip. Plus, amidst the chaos, I managed to crack some jokes, entertain a few souls, and even got folks chuckling at my ‚Äúacceptance of defeat‚Äù dance.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: I‚Äôm telling myself, ‚ÄúHey, it wasn‚Äôt all that bad!‚Äù Why? Because at some point, I had every soul in that room grooving. Picture this scene: no dance floor in sight, just tables, chairs, and a bunch of merry souls jiving awkwardly beside their seats.

But hold on to your hats, folks, ‚Äòcause the night ain‚Äôt over till it‚Äôs over. As the curtains close, I catch a glimpse of the owner‚Äôs face. And oh boy, it‚Äôs not a pretty sight. She drops the bomb: ‚ÄúYou need more practice with Arabic music.‚Äù

Plot twist: I‚Äôm not Arabic‚Ä¶ Yep, that‚Äôs the finale to my epic, if not slightly bewildering, hookah bar debut!

Granted I did try to do my research with the music. I had about 100 tracks, overkill I thought. I had no idea some of the tracks wasn‚Äôt Arabic. Oh well. 

Any tips on how to get over train wreck gigs are much appreciated. Happy new year everyone! #2024"

Even when the companies explicitly tell not to upgrade, people rush to upgrade and then flood every forum asking for help. How is it so hard to understand?

I‚Äôll look into it more this week, but I‚Äôm super happy with my purchase. These are my first CDJs and I‚Äôm extremely happy with my purchase thus far.

826,Four Decades of DJ Mixes from the 1970s to the 2000s - The Disco Preservation Socie,150,DJs,21,"[S.F. Disco Preservation Society](https://sfdps.org/)  
If you have been a DJ for a while, you totally know how the sounds and vibes have changed. I've been clubbing since 1992, and DJing since 94. I love to get into the history of club music, and find forgotten dancefloor bangers from the 70s and 80s to bring back from the dead. One of my favorite tools for this is The Disco Preservation Society which remasters and digitizes dats and tapes from decades past. Not only is it just a fun way to listen to music, it is also interesting to hear how the best DJs mixed in the 70s and 80s, prior to modern hardware.  

It is a bit counterintuitive to navigate (Protip, click the recent mixtapes tab and then click on the user tag) , so here are direct links to each decade:

* [70s Mixes](https://hearthis.at/sfdps/)
* [80s Mixes](https://hearthis.at/eightiesdarchives/)
* [90s Mixes](https://hearthis.at/ninetiesdjarchives/)
* [2000s Mixes](https://hearthis.at/twothousandsdjarchives-oo/) (Just saw they have teens and twenties included with the aughts now, so I guess we are at six decades.)

Hope you enjoy, and please share any good mixes you discover in the comments, I've hardly scratched the surface over the last two years."

I've always just played for fun, participating in events my friends have put on.  I got known for being a good Opener/Warmup DJ and good for the Closing set, as well as for Downtempo rooms.  

On Halloween, some friends and I were putting on a rager and when laying out the lineup there was a slot between 12:30-1:45 and they suggested I do it.  I was so nervous, but I went for it.  It was a huge success and I'm so glad to be over that hump!

So, to all you DJ's who see yourself getting pigeon-holed.  Remember to be patient... to be cool... don't be pushy or arrogant.  Do it because you love it and eventually (and hopefully sooner than it happened for me) you'll be playing the set times you want to.  "

845,DJing to an Empty Bar,147,DJs,76,"I was honored to have been given a residency test run by playing Happy Hour sets on Mondays. I was promised a bar percentage as well. While I did enjoy playing, it was really awkward playing to an empty dancefloor (aside from two friends who showed up).

Keep in mind, I have played to crowds before with moderate success. I have advertised these sets through posts on Instagram and Facebook. When the bar was late in sending me their official flyers, I made my own. I made sure to mention the sets face to face with friends as well. 

Despite that, barely a crowd. I was only paid twice during the run. I definitely learned that the numerous ""likes"" and views people leave on your flyer post online does not equal attendance.

Anyone else experienced this?"
846,How I fell back in love with DJing,146,DJs,31,"I got to dj this week. Something I haven‚Äôt done in over a decade. I was stepping into help out at the kids school. Their annual Halloween disco - a fundraiser for the school‚Ä¶

Two sets. One for years 1, 2 &3. The other for 4,5 and 6. Reader - there was a lot of pressure. Fun pressure, but there was work afoot. First of all. What songs - I didn‚Äôt want it to be the best of Disney , because well that‚Äôs not really a dance. And then I had to check the lyrics so there was no obvious f n jeffing etc. So songs were assessed by the kid and wife: and a playlist was formed. Songs were sourced, apps dabbled with and we were sorted. 

Had to help set up. I took a few extra lights, speakers were there. How hard could be‚Ä¶ I had an hour to set up‚Ä¶

Well. I was there early - you could hear all the kids excited as they headed home, knowing in an hour it was the social event of the season. The game was afoot. 

Let‚Äôs get set up. So first of all. No tables to set up on, but the appeared. Had access to the PA box but the in house speakers we were going to use didnt work. Well one didnt. So a gig with one speaker is no joy. So off to find the other ones. The music room key was found. Got the speakers, cables and the lights. Clocks ticking but doing ok. Untangling the cables. Finally got plugged in. But not very loud. Much fiddling with the mixer and noise could be heard. 

Time before the kids arrived. 15 mins. 

You could hear them lining up. Lights were flashing, blinds closed. It was looking good. Then the fear kicks in. Did I pick good stuff, the other guy who has done it has been for years at the school. I‚Äôm this blow in and I don‚Äôt want to be crap especially so I don‚Äôt embarrass my kid! 

The doors open and my god there is something joyous and fun of 150 ish kids under 8 in full fancy dress hearing loud music. The screeching, the dancing, the running about - the pure fascination of looking at the lights. Started with The Weeknd, Miley Cyrus and lots of pop. And they were having a blast. Bit of Spooky Scary Skeletons and Ghostbuster. The kid was very happy! 

Now for these younger kids - they get a sweetie goodybag as part of their ticket. So when the shutters went up to the tuck shop, 300 eyes lit up. No to manage the barrage - I had to ask the crowd to go up by class. Amazingly. They did. Kids were so polite and then they all sat around the edge in the hall eating Haribo / flying saucers. So I knew I had 5 ish quiet mins before the sugar hit. At that point we had about 25 ish mins until the end. So started with Firework, and they were all singing and dancing. So thought.. let‚Äôs amp this up. Darude

Sandstorm was out many years before these nippers were a sparkle in their parents eyes. But my god it still has such a reaction. The parents and teachers helping out were also giving it the full beans. Hmmmmm. Next. Out of space. Granted I did this for my kid especially but OH MY DAYS. What a reaction - my wife is in the queue outside for collection txting me ‚Äúthe crowd out here are loving it as well‚Äù. Clock is ticking need something moderate and mix into Babyshark. Lads it felt like an illicit rave. Kids were having a blast but we started the end of the night and by the time the lights came on we were all done. 

The noise finally left the room. Wow. Loud. Was just an understatement. 15 mins then the real challenge came on. The older kids. This would be harder. They knew what they wanted. They had been going to this event for years. Regular crowds don‚Äôt always like change. 

‚ÄúOne more time‚Äù is playing as they rush in - and again within 10 mins 150 customers are filling the floor. Boys are trying the breakdance, girls dancing in a circle. It‚Äôs a tale as old as time. 

‚ÄúMove your feet‚Äù still works, nice groove going. The teachers and supervisors are all having a bop. Dig for a little Dee Lite. Groove intensifies. Dua Lipa and then some Swift - all gravy. 

Then the requests come in‚Ä¶ ‚Äúcan you play sweet Caroline?‚Äù

Reader‚Ä¶ now it caught me off guard. Wasn‚Äôt expecting this. But then 2 others asked. So‚Ä¶ transition with a bit of Freed from Desire and the dropped the Diamond. Boom Shaka lack. 

Never have I heard anything as loud or as passionate as all those kids singing with gusto and raising the roof off the place. Did the old kill the track trick off and they didn‚Äôt need any accompaniment. A turning point. The chat from the kids had moved from ‚Äúis the usual dj not doing it‚Äù with a sad face to ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúany chance you can play‚Ä¶‚Äù

We will Rock you? Sure why not. Smells like teen spirit. Errrr I‚Äôd love to but not on my first time here. But then a real wild card‚Ä¶.. One boy. Polite, stylish outfit and obviously well educated. ‚ÄúCan you play ‚Ä¶ never gonna give you up?‚Äù

They wanted Rick Astley

Reader. I‚Äôve played lots of places, to many people. Never have I seen such a wonderful reaction to the opening bars of this song. Everyone sang. Everyone danced. The head teacher was having the time of their life. Pure joy. 

One kid tried to get me to play some metal and even tried to bribe me with some Maom from the tuck shop. Sorry sir but I can‚Äôt be bought. 

The night finished with ghostbusters and then lights on and done. I was shattered but it was one of the best gigs I have ever done. 

Up there with Schooldisco / Frenzy and the Keller nights.

Kids discos don‚Äôt have to be all Disney / cover versions. There was no need to be cool - just good music for people to dance too. Love it. Will I do it again. Absolutely. Great to fall in love with an old hobby again. 

Anyhoo. Thanks for reading if you got this far. Ask me anything if you have questions!"

I like to concentrate more on DJing than messing around with visuals. I've been experimenting with visuals for my live stream and I'd like to share my experiences and see what others do. Let's share our knowledge. 

I stream from my desktop computer using line-in from my mixer, below are different software I've used for my live streams.

Hue Sync - Free  
If you have Philips Hue lights you can use Music Mode to make your lights pulse with the music, you can set different colour schemes and the intensity of the light show.  
[https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/explore-hue/propositions/entertainment/sync-with-pc](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/explore-hue/propositions/entertainment/sync-with-pc)  


Winamp - Free  
You can play linein:// and open up the visualiser to capture in OBS, you can also download visualisation plugins for more variety.  
[https://winamp.com/](https://winamp.com/)  


Electric Sheep - Free version  
This is a screensaver that generates amazing looking trippy visuals but they don't react to music. The free version they allow you to use on your live stream but they ask for you to credit the artist and have link to the electric sheep website.  
[https://electricsheep.org/](https://electricsheep.org/)  


Synesthesia - Free demo - $99 for standard version  
I've only tried out the demo, there is a slight learning curve to this software. This is VJ software that allows you to mix your own videos, images, live camera with heaps of different visuals. You can put them in a playlist and it will play them automatically. There's no option to shuffle the playlist so they'll always be in the same order.  
[https://synesthesia.live/](https://synesthesia.live/)  


Visualz - Free (non-commercial) - $40 yearly (commerical)  
This is a wacky piece of VJ software that essentially allows you to search for GIFs, create a playlist full of gifs and your own images and videos. You can add visual effects to the gifs, videos, images that respond to music, set how frequently the scene changes based how many beats have been played. You can have also have the playlist play automatically but like Synesthesia it will play in order with no random function.

At it seems a lot of you enjoyed my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/ampl9g/for_djs_who_like_to_dig_through_spotify_for_new/) a few months ago, I've recreated (partially) my most popular techno, house and electro Spotify playlists in YouTube and Soundcloud using soundsgood.co to make it as painless as possible.

These playlists are kept in sync daily with any new music added through Spotify, provided that the music exists on either platform and if the app is able to find it.

Unfortunately some of the playlists are a little short compared to what's on Spotify, but they should develop over time.

All links can be found below, the rest are [on my website](https://www.adam-heaton.co.uk/spotify-playlists/). Hope these are useful to some of you!

862,Absolutely Humbled by 2000s,142,DJs,136,"Reasonably well known local DJ in my area (Perth, Aus) for House and Techno. 
Have been mixing for 5 years, playing clubs for 4, started a minimal / deep tech event label 2years ago and have played easily over 100 slots including a few really solid international supports.
220+ mixes online and still mix at home at least once or twice a week for gig prep or giggles..
Nothing special, but I like to think I know what I'm doing. 
Last Sunday however, I did not.

So I'm booked to close the outdoor stage for the Perth leg of T78's Australia run, Techno inside, ""Tech House"" outside.
I already knew the outdoor stage was running a DJM800 & CD2000s, and for most of the night the stage was dead (3-10 people at a time), so I wasn't stressing at all. The strobes inside where stressin' my epilepsy out so I hung out with some of the other DJs in the green room and went to watch the sets outside until it was time to play..

As I'm admiring the vinyl mixing skills of the DJ before me, the dancelfloor suddenly started filling and very quickly. By the time he had to hand over the dancefloor was packed so I stepped and had the sudden realisation, 2000s don't have live waveforms or phase meters.. I've had plenty of live trainwrecks in my time but never in a set have I had to borderline ""filter out"" a track because I'd lost it more than once.. This time I went for the hat-trick with 3 absolutely heinous trainwrecks, not to a point of ""complete loss of vibe"" but definitely those ones where you know that every other DJ in the room is asking themselves if you need them to take over.. 

Managed to pull it together through a solid selection of closing tracks and held the floor all the way till close, big claps n all the rest but it had fully rattled me. Said my goodbyes and got out of there. Managed to get a couple of promo clips from the recording but I think I'll leave this set in the ""unlisted"" section.

I never used sync when I'm playing but I did learn to DJ on a Traktor controller before moving to a RX2 then a DJM800 & 2000nxs', all with live waveforms and and phase meters.
I haven't had to beatmatch completely by ear since a series of bar gigs over a year ago that were running 900s and I guess I had gotten complacent. 2023 has been a massive year for me as a DJ and for my brand but this was one of moments that really puts you back in your place. It's kinda just been sitting with me since, been playing with paper over the decks to force my ear back into doing the work.. 
Having all the bells and whistles makes life alot easier surebut as a promoter with 9 of my own residents, I need to know that my DJs, and therefore me included, can play on a wide range of equipment and aren't going to be stumped in these moments.

TLDR: Trainwrecked my way through a closing set on older equipment and Houdini'd out of the venue into an Uber post-haste to go home and relearn how to actually DJ"
863,Hard Work Paying Off!!!,141,DJs,47,"I don‚Äôt really belong to a tight community of DJs and most of my friends just don‚Äôt understand, but I just had to announce it:

I got my first club residency!!!!! I‚Äôve only been DJing for 6 months, but I‚Äôve put a massive amount of work into it. From website, to promotion, to skill training, to audio efficiency. I dove in 110% and made my success at this DJing thing my main focus. 

I don‚Äôt say this to brag, but I‚Äôm epically proud of myself. There are a few caveats. This ‚Äúclub‚Äù is an outdoor beach volley ball brewery. I‚Äôve been playing on a team for the summer and just noticed the tunes were shit. So, I asked to talk to the owner one night and asked if they‚Äôd ever thought of bringing a DJ on to build business. I got all the excuses: 

Them: They are all unprofessional, unreliable, flaky, and they damaged our audio equipment. 

Me: I am none of those things. Got my own speaks, woofs, and lights. I‚Äôll damage my own stuff!

Them: Are you good? I mean, do you understand how to adapt to diverse crowds?

Me: Yes, from windows to walls‚Ä¶.I got you covered. 

Them:What‚Äôs your fee?

Me: First Friday is on me. I‚Äôll drop a banger of a party. Then we‚Äôll talk money.

Them: Why would I say ‚Äúno‚Äù?

I only share this to encourage all the starters and self-doubters. There are tons of opportunities out there, but they aren‚Äôt going to come to you. Be your biggest fan! Believe in yourself! Your talent will take you places!"

866,This had to be the least prepared opening act I have ever seen. Whats the worst one you've ever seen?,143,DJs,64,"This happened tonight and I wanted to tell this story. It's a bit of a long read but I didn't want to leave out any of the details.  I wish I had made this up.

I've been playing for a long time.  I never really took off beyond local shows but I used to play house at most of the clubs around here.  I took a few years off to work on a new business and recently started playing shows again.

Tonight I'm booked to headline a local show.  I stopped by before the show started to see what the set up was like so I would know what to expect.  Just a basic set up with two CDJ 2000s and a 2000 mixer.  About 10 minutes before doors, I was ready to head back home when I see a panicked couple run up to me asking where to find the promoter.  They were the opening act.  

They had a laptop with Serato on it and tried to plug it into one of the CDJs with a dual sided USB cable.  They couldn't figure out why it wasn't working.  They then tried to plug a hard drive into the CDJ and it wasn't working.  I asked them if they had rekord box and they asked ""what is rekord box?""  I explained what it was and she then was going to try to download it onto their laptop so they could get a set list together.  It was 2 minutes to doors.  

I went and grabbed my laptop and handed it to them so they could copy their tracks onto my laptop and then put them onto a drive with rekordbox.  People were starting to come into the venue so I  threw my flash drive in and started to play some tracks.  I look over at this couple and they finally got their tracks onto my laptop.  They then pulled up their laptop and were setting up their cue points identical to their Serato cue points because in her words ""we can't mix without them.""  

Thirty minutes later they are still working on their ""set"" on my laptop.  There were about 40 people in the show now.  Finally she says ""we are almost ready can you show me how to use this mixer"".  She then asks where the headphone jack plugs in.  Its a 2000 mixer...  She plugs in her headphones, I show her which button to push so she can hear the headphones and then her headphone cord falls out of the jack.  She doesn't have a 1/4 inch and had just tried to plug her 3.5 mm into the headphone jack.  I tell her that she need a 1/4 inch adapter and she goes ""what is a 1/4 inch adapter?""  

At this point I'm getting pretty frustrated as there are more people coming into the venue.  Another DJ that has been at it for years and is playing later in the night comes up and I tell him that he can jump in as I was only playing because it would have been dead air otherwise.  He mixes out of my track and the couple is now trying to figure out how to plug their hard drive into the cdj.  Its not reading for them.  The DJ that is now playing gives them a flash drive and I up my laptop again so they can put their play list onto the flash drive.  As soon as its done exporting, I close my laptop and start walking for the door.  She comes running up to me screaming ""ITS NOT WORKING"".  I walk back up to the decks to see why it isn't reading, she is still holding the flash drive in her hand and hadn't actually plugged it in. 

The other DJ shows her how to plug in the flash drive and select USB.  They have about 15 minutes left in their set.  They push stop on the track playing and everyone stops dancing and just looks at them.  They then push play on their flash drive, their first track starts and exactly at the same time, they both put their hands in the air to what looks like a choreographed dance routine.  I watched them play for their 15 minutes and they screwed up every mix so bad that people stopped dancing at every transtition.  However, during every track at a certain point they would both throw their hands into the air at the same time and start dancing together because they had actually practiced that part.  

I took off to go get some food and am tying this up while I'm eating at Betos.  

I get first show jitters but if you don't know what rekordbox is, you don't know what a 1/4 inch adapter is and you don't know how to plug a flash drive into a cdj, mayber you aren't quite ready to be playing at a show people are paying to go to.  They obviously had spent time practicing their dance moves together but had no idea how to actually mix without trying to pre-program everything?  They would rather give up their stage time to make sure their cue points were set, instead of playing music for people?  Thats not DJ'ing.  

The promoter is a good guy.  They assured him that they knew what they were doing and had done this before.  I've got to go back in about an hour to finish out the night.  

So lets hear your least prepared DJ stories.

877,Life Lessons from DJs,141,DJs,32,"Hey fellow DJs,

I wanted to derive some life lessons from the art of DJing. Let me know if you agree or can think of other life lessons :)

1. **Do the necessary prep work and have a solid plan, but leave room for spontaneity.** If you‚Äôre giving a presentation or planning a family vacation, there are the types that will prepare every single detail while others wing it. Be prepared with the outline and important details but leaving some room for spontaneity because often that is where the magic happens.¬†
2. **Innovation mostly happens through incremental improvements and risk taking.** There are actually very few original ideas in our world, and that‚Äôs okay. Most DJs are playing other people‚Äôs music old and new, but the good ones chop it up, combine them with other songs, remove some elements of a song and highlight others. It‚Äôs okay to borrow ideas and content (legally) and add your own ‚Äúspin‚Äù on it. These incremental ideas no matter how minute or trivial may spark inspiration in your audience so share them.¬†
3. **It is important to play.** You‚Äôve seen performers young and old. They are incorporating play and movement into their life. Be vulnerable, be silly, share joy around you when you can and are able, and most importantly, incorporate some play into your routine.
4. **You‚Äôre going to make mistakes, deal with it.** You can plan the perfect set, the perfect speech, the perfect plans, and something is bound to go wrong, big or small. During my first public DJ set, I accidentally hit the pause/play button with my wrist during exuberant motion. Silence. Silence is the cardinal sin of being a good DJ. Not everyone is going to notice your mistakes or remember them, so laugh it off, learn, and move on. If you‚Äôre not making mistakes, you‚Äôre not pushing yourself or learning.¬†
5. **Do things for yourself, but also do it for others.** Creating positive experiences for others feels good. It gives purpose, no matter how small the gesture or impact it has on this world. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in our own thoughts and egos.¬†"

4 hours later I realized the man I asked for directions was Todd Terry -_- Todd if you're out there something I forgot to mention is that while I am not particularly into classic house, you are one of the few DJs that keep it old school and are amazing on the decks.

I'm a person who used to really enjoy drops, but thanks to this behavior, which seems particularly prevalent in the modern tech house scene, I am actually starting to be totally desensitized to them because what some people seem to not remember is that the thing that makes the drop the drop is the contrast to the buildup and breakdown sections of the tracks - all drops all loud all the time gets very boring and fatiguing fast, and it would be like just making an entire 5 minute long track of highly compressed noise.

At the same time, I understand that if a certain video style is getting more views, a DJ is going to do what they need to do to build their social media presence - mostly as a survival mechanism. What are your thoughts?"

Going mobile (not wedding DJ as such) - any recommendations for a setup alongside this that would be reasonably portable, good sound / lows & comfortably do a midsize venue 150-200 people? 

I would also be happy for anyone with experience in comparing a traditional setup with something like a column array option too.

I had the thought to start carrying around a USB of music and headphones out to parties/ events. 
Twice I have been asked if I want to play when I wasn't even booked or just came to dance and party. 

This has generated me much more big opportunities, since having those moments to showcase my music and talent, has resulted in more interest in booking me. I used to do 10 PM slots where barely anyone has shown up yet, and now I convinced the booking manager to move me to a later slot and may even open before the headliner. 

As many say, go out, be social in your local community, talk to the show runners, and eventually things will work out if you got the skill.

Edit: Since some of you mentioned not wanting to be ""that annoying guy that hopes to hop in"" I want to point out that I didn't hang around the booth and bug any DJs. I just went out and had a good time like anyone not a DJ. I just happen to be friends with people that own the system and club and it was after the show."
917,Mass Layoffs at Native Instruments,137,DJs,117,"**BIG UPDATE**

**Native Instruments just fired about 100 people.**

**BACKGROUND**

You guys may remember the long investigation I did of Native Instruments a few months ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/NativeInstruments/comments/carm7f/financial_analysis_of_native_instruments_xpost/

That was based on financial statements up to 2017. I ended the post with these words:

> If [the changes made in 2018] changes didn‚Äôt perform as well as hoped then 2019 will be a bad year. Whoever in management was behind the plans from 2017/2018 will have a lot of explaining to do and new strategies will have to be developed. We‚Äôve been hearing reports of entire teams being fired in 2019 and the Glassdoor reviews are terrible. If those indicators are to be believed, then 2018 might not have worked out as planned and now the holding company and the management are trying to course correct. This could also include things like mergers, acquisitions, or sale of all or part of the company in more dire circumstances.

Well, an article just broke that was nothing but a rehash of my original post (it‚Äôs garbage, you can skip it), but what *is* interesting is a comment in its comment sections, from Sept 2 (today):

> ‚Äú100 peeps fired in Berlin, almost all hardware teams are fired. Maschine stand-alone was cancelled on the first day of mass production.‚Äù

https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/09/01/native-instruments-layoffs/ 

That got me digging further and I found this thread on the NI forums discussing my post, which I had somehow missed over the summer. 

https://www.native-instruments.com/forum/threads/current-state-of-ni-interesting-thread-on-reddit.358871/page-5

It includes a discussion of all the layoffs yesterday, in particular the following bombshell:

- **The Maschine *and* Traktor product owners were just laid off**

This came from a Google doc floating around Twitter with all list of all people looking for work now. Here‚Äôs the Gdoc, which has unfortunately since been deleted:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ExvH5Nut_5xsyV-Uwohk-C7UupT5AcpG6T2vaUxo1eo/htmlview#gid=0

A Twitter comment with one of the lead devs who got laid off clarified these are lay-offs, not entire division closures, but still about 100 people seem to have been fired. 

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?**

It‚Äôs hard to speculate until more information comes out (which will be soon, no doubt), but it looks like my 2018 scenario was sadly accurate. 

My guess is that the big moves made in 2017 didn‚Äôt work out as intended from a financial perspective and now the axe is falling. 

This **does not mean** NI is going out of business, your products will stop working, or that nothing new will be coming out. As my analysis shows, they‚Äôve still got a decent bank account and a profitable business, even if it‚Äôs a strategic mess and has been behind the curve on innovation in recent years. 

What it **might mean** is that the new financial bosses are turning the screws hard, probably with an eye towards eventual sale to a large group like InMusic. But *this is pure speculation* until we learn more. 

Bottom line, this is really sad news for all those involved. I hope they find awesome jobs elsewhere and continue to make our musical lives better with even better software and hardware products. 

More soon."

923,PSA: mixing vinyl and mental health,136,DJs,27,"Goes without saying that the last 18 months have been very hard on‚Ä¶ everyone. I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to go into why. But in these circumstances, mental health is something we all need to consciously work at. I‚Äôm just here to share a few thoughts on why mixing vinyl is particularly good for you.

First, let‚Äôs talk about **flow.** This is an experience state you can have on any thoroughly engaging activity, which is in the sweet spot between too easy - and your attention wanders off - and too hard ‚Äì where the frustration may drop you out. It can be a place where your internal monologue is quietened as your full attention engages in your thought processes. You are in the zone, fully immersed and time flies by without noticing. Many things can provide flow ‚Äì programming, spinning tunes, studying, really immersive gaming.

Now let‚Äôs add to that one more concept: **language processing**. Language processing is an innate cognitive process that happens every time you do things around language. Which is almost all the time. So reading and writing emails, researching a term paper, organising and crunching analysis in a spreadsheet, being in meetings, almost all aspects of daily work life involve your verbal processing. And this includes searching for or reading off the names of tunes in your rekordbox collection, and even reading off the countdown timer on your CDJ LCD screen taps it too.

The secret sauce of vinyl mixing is that it is much better for enabling a **flow state** with a much much **lower language processing load**. Mixing records, compared to most digital setups, takes most or all of the verbal processing away. All beatmatching needs to be done by ear, no sync button or reading off BPMs - just sliding that pitch control around. Deciding when to mix in the next tune is based on your internal memory of the tune structure, plus of course just visually looking at where the needle is at. Tune selection from your record bag is much more visual that language based as well: when you know your record sleeves and labels you‚Äôre really recalling what to flip through and reach for by recognizing colours and shapes, nothing as verbally involved as a scrolling a glowing rekordbox library screen on a laptop.

My experience of good long stretches of **flow state, non-verbal processing, vinyl DJing time** is that it is intensely relaxing, and the benefits last for days. I first observed this maybe 10 years ago when I was doing a half dozen gigs a month, often 4-5 hour long sets. The gigs that I only brought vinyl, I could really feel a difference in the \*kind\* of effort going on and the mental fatigue at the end of a long night. I would have drawn very little on the already-tired language processing centres that are involved in my long-hours day job, and instead I‚Äôve flexed hard some other parts of the brain instead. (And they are literally other parts of the brain). And the next day or back at work on the Monday I felt like I‚Äôd had much more of an excursion away from the regular tasks of the day job: emails, emails, meetings, spreadsheets, and so on. And was much more refreshed for it.

TLDR: Mixing tunes is always good for you. And... I humbly submit that mixing tunes on vinyl is *really, uniquely* good for you, in a way that digital DJing cannot fully replicate. So if your spouse raises their eyebrows at your next wax shipment, just remember this post and reassure them you‚Äôre making an investment in your mental health.

TLDR TLDR:

For your brain, your whole damn life is arm day

Mixing vinyl is leg day

Don't skip leg day"
924,I miss day parties/clubbing/festivals with loud music,136,DJs,60,"So here in Victoria, after months of lockdown we've had 0 cases of COVID-19 for 61 days, and restrictions have finally started to loosen, about 2 weeks where dancing was legal again but limits on people still. 12 hours before NYE it was announced that we now have 3 cases and that from 5pm NYE some of these freedoms were being taken away again despite people already having planned parties for NYE. I'd planned mine out on the back deck early in the afternoon-early evening so we could play nice music in the sun and watch the sun set and also bc considerate to neighbours later in the night and move the music inside, a couple of my mates had started coming around (we are allowed to have 15 people with restrictions) and there were about 3 of us enjoying the nice weather at 3:30pm in the afternoon when the police come around the side and ask us to turn the music off as one of the neighbours have made a noise complaint. We were not playing anything heavy or anything offensive, just some laid back house music to enjoy some drinks with mates to see out this year. It was going to be the closest thing to going out and dancing with other people we've had in a long time. It's bad enough that it feels like we're stuck in our houses all the time but it truly feels horrible with the feeling that I can't play music outside in the sun without it being illegal unless you go to a remote location. I'd give anything to be partying and dancing to loud music with lovely people that appreciate music

TLDR: restrictions being tightened with 5 hours notice when parties had already been planned, wanted to enjoy some nice music on the back deck during the day in the nice weather so we could turn it off later at night for the neighbours and at 3:30pm we had police show up with a noise complaint"

935,My transition from bedroom DJ to first club gig,133,DJs,25,"Just randomly wanted to share my experience of transitioning from a bedroom DJ to playing my first gig at a club. I actually posted on here about a year ago regarding possibly being an opener for Malaa. I had so much great feedback then but one thing that stuck out to me was that‚Ä¶if I thought I was ready, I probably wasn‚Äôt and that I should take a little more time to fine tune my craft. One year later I finally decided to go for it. Yesterday I played my first club gig as one of the openers for Kaskade. And HOLY SHIT lol I‚Äôm still riding that high today. It felt surreal to step into that DJ booth, touching CDJ 3000s which until now I‚Äôve only ever seen on YouTube. The powerful bass of the club speakers gave me goosebumps. The lighting and visuals that accompanied my set, was literally shit I‚Äôve daydreamed about. And when I played one of my all time favorite tracks ‚ÄúAll You Need Is Love‚Äù by Avicii, I was ready to cry tears of joy lol. 

I went into this planning to do this as a one time bucket list type thing, but I want to feel all that again. I‚Äôm addicted. I‚Äôve never played for maybe more than 10 people and last night I prob played for 100. That‚Äôs wild to me.

Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure why I felt like sharing all this. Maybe it‚Äôs to encourage other bedroom DJs to just fucking go for it! Breakout of your comfort zone. You won‚Äôt regret it.

***Update: guess it would be important to add some details on how I even got the gig. I do want to clarify that I was one of 3 openers for Kaskade lol and I definitely wasn‚Äôt the one right before him either. 

It‚Äôs pretty simple really, a club promoter who also handles the opening talent asked my friend if he knew any DJs as they‚Äôre always looking for opening talent. I reached out to the promoter and he asked for a 30 minute sample mix. From there he just told me to text him for any upcoming shows that I might be interested in. Of course there‚Äôs a lot of promoting that goes into it, it‚Äôs essentially pay to play. You‚Äôre required to sell a certain amount of tickets. I feel like there is a lot mixed feelings about this but for me I thought it was fair. I‚Äôm a nobody with no experience lol what does the club gain by letting you play. So I get it. Selling the tickets is the hardest part haha. But you do get paid. Eventually when you‚Äôve built yourself up you can reach the slot right before the headliner and then you‚Äôre not required to sell tickets anymore. Once I decided on the show I had a logo and visuals made on Fiverr. Easy peasy lol."
936,"I think I've cracked the nut on requests, looking for some feedback",137,DJs,74,"Hi friends!

As things start to open back up, I want to share my quarantine project with everyone here and solicit some feedback. Basically, [I've made a website](https://playitfor.me/) that in my opinion solves the biggest problems DJs face when taking requests:

1. People hovering the DJ booth

I know we've all had this problem where folks are hovering at the DJ booth to try and tell you their request. I've solved this by using a custom QR code for each event. You can direct people to scan the QR code with their phone rather than bug you. The process is super easy, and the audience gets feedback that their request is in the system.

2 The requests never work in your set

Once the requests come to you, it's hard to keep track of the songs and know which ones you could play next. I've solved this problem by introducing a way to filter songs by bpm and artist, and to hide requests you've already played. Additionally, you can sort requests by the amount of times a song has been requested. It only works with tracks in my database, but I've been adding more and more songs.

I taught myself how to make websites because I had some inspiration when I was the president of my Uni's DJ club. I finally feel comfortable sharing my work with y'all. It has seen some use at gigs already from a brave tester, and I'm stoked to see if I can help more people. Check it out here: https://playitfor.me/

Best part is, it‚Äôs FREE! I show an ad after the request has been made to try and cover hosting for now. If there is interest I‚Äôm going to add a premium tier with more features for a small monthly fee. Please feel free to AMA!"

940,"Change my mind: Sam Feldt's track selection is good, but this is too cringeworthy to ignore. So many fake moves following each other, no DJ should let a camera so close to him if this makes 99% of his set.",137,DJs,210,
941,The crazy lucky story of how I landed a residency at a popular club in my city,136,DJs,27,"To preface this, this club is a very popular club with a dope rooftop in the summer time in my city. They play hip-hop and a range of house every night. More house or hip hop, depending on the DJ, but they lean house most nights because they don‚Äôt want a too ‚Äúghetto‚Äù vibe (managers words). One DJ runs a four hour set 10-2, with no other DJs in the house unless he brought a friend to tag team. Admittedly, they don‚Äôt promote the DJ or really go after ‚Äútalent.‚Äù The DJs are mainly guys from the club manager‚Äôs inner circle, although they are quite good in my opinion and have years of experience. On to the story.

 

At the time, I had been bedroom DJing for almost two years. I put out mixes regularly and DJd as many house parties as I possibly could. I DJd my buddies charity event at the Restaurant and Bar he owns and even a yoga class at the studio my girlfriend at the time taught at. I was hungry to play out and was doing so basically anywhere that would let me.

 

It was my birthday back in 2014 and we had decided to get a booth and bottles at the aforementioned club for the night. Mid-twenties at the time and any excuse to party worked for us. So we pre-gamed at my place and the twenty or so of us headed to the club.

 

I get to the club feeling good, buzzed but not smashed. Loose. The manager takes us to our table up on the rooftop, its right next to the DJ booth. After some years in the game I know this is cringe but I couldn‚Äôt help myself at the time. After settling in at the table and making a drink, I get up and hop up in the DJ booth to ‚Äútalk shop‚Äù with the DJ. Ask him what software he‚Äôs using, how long he‚Äôs been spinning, and some other bullshit. He‚Äôs nice and cordial and answers my questions with a smile but within 30 seconds the big ol bouncer that was in the corner tells me I gotta get out the booth. No problem. I jump down and carry on partying.

 

Maybe on hour goes by, I‚Äôm not exactly sure. I‚Äôm having a blast with my friends (and a few more drinks). I‚Äôm feeling really good at this point. All of a sudden the bouncer that kicked me out earlier appears in front of me with the club manager. I‚Äôm a bit startled and immediately think I‚Äôm getting kicked out, though I‚Äôm not sure why.

 

The club manager asks if I DJ. I have no idea what he‚Äôs talking about. I reply with a confused ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù He repeats himself and tells me look at the DJ booth. The DJ booth is perpendicular to our table so I can see inside. The DJ is literally slouched in the booth unable to stand up. The dude drank too much. The manager asks me again if I can actually DJ because the bouncer overhead our conversation. I say yeah sure, I DJ (not telling him never in the club). He tells me that he‚Äôll pay me if I can fill in the rest of the night‚Ä¶..

 

Normally I‚Äôd be too nervous not knowing this guy‚Äôs library, equipment, and being so on the spot. But I was lit up at this point and said fuck it. I jump into the booth. He‚Äôs running Serato on a Pioneer controller. I run Traktor. But Serato is barebones enough that I can run it. This guy had put on a 15 minute prerecorded mix. I wonder how often he did that‚Ä¶..but it‚Äôs great news for me. I take the time to familiarize myself with the basics of his set up and library and then mix in. For the next hour or hour and half until close, I can‚Äôt really remember how long or when I got on, I DJ‚Äôd on this guy‚Äôs set up. I kept the mixing simple, nothing crazy or fancy, but it didn‚Äôt matter. The club manager was just happy that he didn‚Äôt have to plug in his iPhone. The best part about it was that my entire crew was right next to the booth, so with every big track I dropped I would turn and bounce with my entire group of friends. The whole roof was hoppin, it was one of the best feelings I‚Äôve ever had in my entire life. It was so spontaneous but so perfect. My fill in set went without a hitch and I shut it down right at 2am as requested.

 

The manager offered to pay me but I refused payment. I had too much fun. He said that if I wouldn‚Äôt take cash, I had a bottle and table on him the next time I wanted to come out. I told him I would love to play here again in a better situation. We exchanged numbers and I began getting calls from there. It wasn‚Äôt an immediate residency though. I still had to earn it. I got some Thursday‚Äôs here and there and the occasional weekend spot. It was only after repeated good performances and learning to adhere to the manager‚Äôs out of whack desires did I get regular weekend spots.

 

I know it‚Äôs crazy. Almost unbelievable. But honest to god it happened.

 

TL;DR: Bedroom and house party DJd for couple years, filled in for a drunk DJ mid party at club, landed a residency

 Edit: thanks for the gold!!

945,Why do people stop going to clubs as they get older? And what could we do about that?,133,DJs,478,"It is probably common knowledge that most people tend to go out less as they get older. Some of the reasons might be understandable (e.g., having less time available due to work and family). However, I've wondered for some time why some people who absolutely loved to go out and dance when they were younger completely stopped doing that at some point. 

On the other hand, I personally know active DJs (both for underground and mainstream music) in their 50s and 60s and also clubbers in that age group. I also see that there are some non-mainstream parties emerging that specifically target 30+/40+ as age groups. Those typically open earlier, end earlier and also make it clear that it won't be awkward to be there for someone who is not 21 any more.

So I've been wondering: What might be reasons for people to stop going clubbing? And what are possible approaches that we as DJs and promoters could take to make events feel inclusive for people of different age groups?"
946,"My home was robbed last night, my gig is tonight",133,DJs,34,"I‚Äôm a little in shock right now and so I‚Äôm just looking for a little community to lift my spirits. I appreciate any kind words of encouragement. 

Last night After dark, someone climbed up the side of my home, somehow made it though iron bars, unlocked a second story sliding glass door, and came in. It‚Äôs a rental so I‚Äôm assuming they have hit this place before and know how to access the home. They stole 3 laptops, my journal, and cash. They weren‚Äôt able to fit my Ddj1000 back out through the bars, so thankfully I still have that (along w all my credit cards and IDs). My pregnant wife is safe as well. 

I play a big show later tonight and I‚Äôm just completely shook. Its my first gig in weeks and I‚Äôve been working so fucking hard to craft 3 hours of quality vibes, and now it‚Äôs gone along with my laptops. Thank god I have some music backed up onto my portable flash drive which I had on my keys. But I lost days of work I‚Äôd prepared for the gig, all the acapellas I‚Äôd carefully sliced, and all my sampler routines I had planned out. I have some music to play on the drive but no way to go in and prep a set.

That‚Äôs all, I guess. I am feeling pretty numb and can‚Äôt really think straight right now. Send me some positive vibes for tonight.

Post-show Update: thank you all so much‚Ä¶ literally brought me to tears reading a few of your inspirational posts. I put a few more details in a reply below, but overall the show went really well. It took a minute to find that flow and really lock in, I was just really uncomfortable at first without any track organization (the only usb I had was just raw tracks, no playlists) but once I found that rhythm, the next two hours were pure joy, like nothing could hold me back. Feeling that resilience you all talked about. Sending so much love out there to you all. Hope I can pay it back one day"

954,Always wear hearing protection,131,DJs,52,"I just want to put out a friendly PSA. I can imagine that pretty much all of us started DJing because we have a strong passion for music and what better way to enjoy your favorite music than mix it together live with your own personal flair?

That said, if you want to keep the passion for your music alive I really recommend attenuated hearing protection. I'm not going to shill for my favorite brand, as there are many good ones out there but I will say you should all learn to carry hearing protection with you religiously. 

Tinnitus is an absolute bitch and it will never go away. If you don't want a dull continuous ring in your hearing that can affect how you enjoy music and your life outside of music then attenuated hearing protection is the best thing you can do for yourself. Very decent ones run for like 20 bucks and if anything on huge sound systems they make the music sound better, as they are literal mufflers for your ears.

Another thing to consider is that you don't always have to have the booth monitors topped near the max like your master output. Turn the booth monitors down when you're not mixing in a new track or if the sound system on the dance floor needs some help see if it is alright with the club/venue if you can't point one of the monitors onto the dance floor. 

I am so shocked to see some professional touring DJ's and producers who still don't wear hearing protection. I can only imagine that their hearing is absolutely fucked but yours doesn't have to be. 

Get 20 decibel or 27 decibel ones if you can. Some sound systems can put out over 130 decibels of sound which is absolutely insane for your hearing. I don't feel like pulling up the OSHA fact sheet on safe decibel and time limits but I can tell you prolonged exposure is not good for you and the damage is permanent.

This is just a friendly PSA, as I want all of us to continue doing what we love, and to be able to always hear the music as it is intended for the long term. Take care everyone. For real. "

When I showed up, DJ Zeke was immediately complaining that there were other acts there besides him. He was told that he was the only one opening up. Fair enough, that does suck, but I was also booked to open.

Instead of letting me spin for the first 30 minutes as planned, he hopped on and spun instead. I tried talking to the promoters, who just said when he was done, I could play.

He never finished.

At this point, I'm getting pretty pissed off, and I had asked to mix multiple times. His response was to get on the mic and diss me and my partner in front of the entire crowd, calling us ""Hundred Dollar DJs"" and ""Jokes"".

I wasn't having any of it. I jumped to my mixer and started playing. 

His entire crew jumped on us. I was grabbed and pushed against the wall by his manager, my partner was threatened, and our mixer was unplugged.

I usually would never call out another DJ, but DJ Zeke completely disrespected me, as well as other DJs last night. That shouldn't be how things work, and if it is, this industry is way more fucked then I thought it was.

For the Friday night, I have played gigs here and there at the venue and have been working to try and get a spot for a while so, networking with them, staff and the other DJs paid off.

For the Saturday night, I'm as surprised as you are, but I got it through a competition they posted on social media. Random stabs in the dark work now and then.

It's been almost 10 months since I've posted on /r/DJs \- been working hard under the radar and, come a long way now, I'm proud to share new full fledged features for DJs and live musicians of all kinds!

[CUE Music is a live audio streaming platform, free on iOS, Android, and Web, designed for DJs and musicians to perform and engage with an online audience](https://preview.redd.it/rblajhg1pqn31.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=02daf00c5664173380a6c3d78258e161d32cabdb)

&#x200B;

# Here's why I think everyone should be using CUE.

&#x200B;

**- Traktor, VirtualDJ, and Mixxx come with built-in broadcasting. You deserve a tool that lets you go live whenever you're mixing, simply by hitting that button! (Others can broadcast easily using BUTT - yes, BUTT)**

We built a new feature where you can go live just as you would on TwitchTV (but audio only) - just hit broadcast and you're live! Previously, the only broadcasting option was through scheduling a performance on one of the available stages, and this type of booking could be seen as a hassle to some, so we've built an instant stream option directly on your profile. But, a lot of additional features are only available if you perform on one of the stages so it's worth the extra hassle.

**- Most live streaming options require video, many of which get taken down due to copyright infringement (e.g. Facebook Live, TwitchTV)**

We are an audio only platform with licensing, automatic song detection, and a fluid music experience via mobile app and web platform. Want to mix and have your friends tune in on the road? Or want to share your live performances to your following on twitter? Or even embed a live music player directly on your website? CUE Music makes this easy and accessible. Each user and each stage has its own live player for sharing.

[Example embeddable live player for a stage](https://cue.dj/player/stage/residencies)

[Example embeddable live player for a user](https://cue.dj/player/REDIjay)

**-  We save a full track list of your all performances for your reference and exploration**

DJ programs with built-in broadcasting sends song metadata (for others, we use audio fingerprinting technology to detect songs) in which we cross-reference various databases to catalog all songs played on CUE Music by artist and record label. We currently only have \~40K unique songs that have been performed so far, but this system provides a great way to crate dig, listen to previews, and discover discrete songs that other DJs have already found and played.

**-  Listening to live music through other DJs, especially with social engagement and chat rooms is one of the best and most enjoyable ways to discover new music**

Not only is it enjoyable on the receiving end, it's really fun playing and having listeners engaging with your mix in real time over the internet. Each stage and each profile has its own chat room to engage the audience and DJ. You can also favorite songs that will auto save to your favorites collection as well as cheer on the DJ and see live animations for everyone's reactions.

**-  Other key features**

* Automatically save your performances to Mixcloud (currently only to CUE Music's account - will be able to on your own Mixcloud account in the future)
* Followers can receive notifications whenever you book a new performance and also when you go live
* Easy to use direct messaging system
* Live stream statistics dashboard to see a live tally of the audience's reactions
* Spotify integration so you can playback songs if you have Spotify premium

&#x200B;

We started sign ups at the end of June 2018 and are still in open beta. We want to get everything perfected to an industry grade caliber before we officially launch. We've not yet had any marketing efforts, so the community is still small (\~2.8K users & 400+ DJs), but we do intend to grow massively in the future.

Though small, our community is very welcoming, supportive, and active on the platform, so we welcome you all with open arms! We're aiming to launch at the beginning of 2020 and have been awarding an early user title ""CUE Pioneer"" to all users whom we intend on giving perks out to in the future (although unsure exactly what). So at the very least please do register and check out the platform!

Also, if anyone represents a large collective of DJs, music organization, record label, or music venue and would be interested in having your own stage on CUE, or even if /r/DJs would like its own stage for community building, please do contact me! We would love to provide a space for you to represent yourselves and for your communities to mix live for one another.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I want to give a huge thank you to /r/DJs, /r/Beatmatch, and DJ TechTools for being the open channels for getting CUE its first beta users. We wouldn't be anywhere without our beta users! <3

969,Is the warm up era dead?,132,DJs,76,"We all came into the DJ game understanding that warming up is an essential part of the night, that can last for hours (especially where I'm at where clubs close at 4)

However I noticed especially after the pandemic, and the rise of bars and lounges over large venue clubs, that the crowd isn't as receptive to warm ups as they were before.

Typically the warm up session, everyone grooves so whatever is being played (within reason of course)... Do a bit of drinking and socializing... That doesn't happen as often as before anymore... Now ppl either sit on their phones (since bars and lounges have more seating in comparison to most clubs I've played in), or just stand around until the hype/current shit gets played, or they finally get a little buzz going.

I feel like part of it is a result of the streaming era and the death of radio..
Say what u want about the radio era, but it made everyone, even casual music listeners, hear the same music, be it old or new. But with this new generation of club goers that grew up with streaming, they never had to listen to anything apart from exactly what they want to listen to... There's hardly any reason for them to be exposed to different music/artists than what they actively search for... So I find that when they do go out, they simply aren't interested in hearing anything else apart from the exact music they already listen to...

If course there are exceptions, and by the end of the night when everyone is drunk, they're more receptive, but that brings me back to my original point... The end of the night isn't the warm up portion... Now more than ever I've even seen the top DJs not get the crowd energy that they're used to when warming up... And what that has forced some DJs to do is play the current/primetime shit much earlier that they would like because as opposed to a big club, or a big event, these younger clubgoers will simply leave to go to a different bar...

Sorry for the long post, but just wondering if this is a trend that u guys have been noticing... Or is it different since many of u may DJ in spots that close at 2am, so the warm up time may not be as extensive for you to realize a difference... Because where I'm at, around 2am is where we get to the shits... Although it's not too frowned upon to start turning up between 1 and 2, depending on the DJs and the crowd"

I thought for sure the general consensus in the industry is that he‚Äôs one of few Real DJs around right now. But I‚Äôm learning that the definition of a Real DJ is subjective. 

In this [IG Reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CnRuK5DJsIb/?igshid=ZmMyNmFmZTc=)
, he showcases his ability to mix on four decks and it‚Äôs very well done, maybe one tiny mistake with the vocals but still inspirational nonetheless. 

Then I saw the comments‚Ä¶soooo Much Hate. I don‚Äôt understand it. Everyone calling him a Push Play DJ and ‚Äúall he‚Äôs doing is looping‚Äù and ‚ÄúI bet he can‚Äôt do that on vinyl‚Äù 

Truly‚Ä¶who the fuck could do that on vinyl? on four decks nonetheless,And if he‚Äôs a push play DJ, then what the fuck is everybody else coz he seems to do more than most DJs out there? 

I guess I don‚Äôt understand the hate, even if you don‚Äôt like his music, surely you can appreciate his ability to mix? 

And really, I don‚Äôt care what people think of James Hype, I have my opinion, everyone is entitled to theirs, but reading the comments‚Ä¶apparently anyone using a CDJ or any modern DJ equipment makes you a lazy DJ, and I think that‚Äôs what concerns me most. 

I‚Äôm fully aware the trolls in the comments are probably talentless keyboard warrior hacks but I thought I‚Äôd get an opinion from this community. 

Cheers.

Edit: I guess there is another element of DJ‚Äôing and that‚Äôs producer DJs like Stephan Bodzin and Richie Hawtin who will improvise tracks live and on the fly which is a whole other ball game but I digress."

I have been a DJ for about 15 years.

I started in middle school, DJing YMCA teen night dances for $50 a gig with a radio shack mixer, 2 walkmen, and $30 car speakers. No joke. 

In college, I was doing 2-3 events a week. I got to a point where I didn't even need to look at my vinyl crates and was able to grab the right record out. And yes, kisses for requests work. Sometimes too well. 

Now, 15 years later. I have a full time non-DJing job. I have a family. I do about 5 bar gigs and 10 weddings a year, and I dread each one of them. 

The bar gigs are the ones that keep my creative juices going, but I just don't have the stamina to go to 1:30am anymore. And the money just isn't good enough for a 3-4 hour gig. 

The wedding gigs are good money, but it's just the same shit every time, and you get jaded very quickly in the wedding industry. You can only play Jason Mraz so many times before you bang your head on your laptop. 

I'll still have my home set up, I'll still seek out the vinyl section in every music store, but I think I'm done with gigs. 

This has been one of the best part of my life for 15 years, and I don't regret it for a second. I can't say every gig was fun, I think my worst had to be either the elementary school picnic, a birthday party where 2 people showed up, or the Korean wedding where a drunk groomsman attacked me with my own mic stand.

Not sure about you, but getting real tired of this shit being the reason you get to DJ at certain spots. 

Gigging shouldn't be based around how many you can bring along with you, especially at a venue that will pack out on a Saturday, not some brand new just opened club/bar. 

My job as the DJ is to get the people there to stay and buy drinks and have a good time. Keep them dancing. Make them want to come back. Make them stay and buy more drinks from your bar. 

Your promoters and social media teams job is to get people in the door. Sure, I'll promote my slot there and in turn your venue, but I'm not going to go begging my friends to come out and buy tables or make sure they mention my name at the door. I'm not going to go around begging people to buy bottles.

I expect to catch some flack for my opinion, but it seems ridiculous that I'm being turned down for more gigs at a venue because I didn't sell enough tables, when the bar was PACKED with people who stayed the entire night. My skills as a DJ, which is what I was hired to do, were up to par. Why am I being penalized because I couldn't sell bottles?

Edit: This was at a smaller venue. Out of the about 15 tables they had available for bottle service, 8 or 10 were sold. "
998,Notes on some DJ Pools,122,DJs,92,"tl;dr:

* house DJ
* Heavy Hits is decent
* BPM Supreme is better
* ZIPDJ is best

For background, I was a regularly playing club DJ from 1997 through until the beginning of 2003. I was playing anywhere from three to five nights a week during this time. Played on both CD and vinyl. Heavy lean toward house, but reality meant I would end up playing a bit of hip hop, pop, and dance in my sets. I just started back in a little under two months ago with trying to build it back up again and turned to some DJ pools to build up my collection again without dropping $500 at Beatport.

Digital DJ Pool

This was the first one I tried out due to its $1 for five days/fifteen downloads per day trial. It seemed to be alright. I was able to crawl through all their releases from January 1 until the end of May and found 75 tracks. That seemed to be a good sign and I signed up for a month.

I don't know if it was the five full months of material to select from that gave the appearance of a lot of music that appealed to me or if the quality dropped significantly, but I quickly found I was going days without downloading anything. This included days where there were nearly 20 new tracks that met my search criteria.

It felt like it was being overloaded by user submitted content, giving it the appearance of having a lot of content. Most of this was mediocre to bad. In one case there was a track uploaded that not only wasn't mastered, but sounded like they hadn't bother to even try to mix it. The signal to noise ratio on DDJP was far, far  too low for me.

BPM Supreme

My second pool and a night and day change from DDJP. It feels a lot like a curated service where they only post the content that they believe is going to hit. For my searched there might only be four to ten tracks a day, but easily half of them were tracks I was interested in download. It's a solid service with decent quality. If it was my only pool I would be happy with it and would recommend it for anyone looking for a pool on a budget.

Doing the Damage

I picked this up on the recommendation from a throw away comment from someone here on Reddit. It is 90% bootlegs and mashups you can find yourself on Soundcloud and Hypeddit. Since I tend toward originals and current music, this ended up being almost worthless to me. Their cancellation policy is such that once you cancel your account you're immediately locked out. I cancelled my account early and closed the tab. I'll eat that lost money rather than spend 45 minutes every other day going through music I'm not interested in.

If you're heavily into mashups and bootlegs, it might be for you. It's not for me.

Heavy Hits

Another Reddit recommendation, but a really solid option. They tend to have more per day than BPM Supreme does, but I find they lag behind the release dates. I found one day where fully half of what had been posted was previously released by BPM Supreme anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months earlier. The other half of the content was either out of my general BPM range, bootlegs, or remixes of old tracks. It's definitely a solid service. If you're looking for more content at the same price as BPM Supreme, it's worth a look.

ZIPDJ

Mind blown.

I will admit this isn't for the faint of heart. It is drinking from the fire hose. In their 'house' section alone there are over 100 releases daily. It means you are going to be digging for tracks, but it also means you're going to find nearly every single thing you're look for. It is continuously updated and has a massive library. I took a cursory glance at how many 'house' releases they'd posted since July 1st and it was in the 2300 range. Other services you might get one or two remixes of a track. ZIP posts \_all of them\_ and the number of labels they get music from is insane.

There are three downsides.

1. It's expensive. Even their cheapest, download limit account is more expensive than BPM Supreme or Heavy Hits.
2. Single download. Once you've downloaded a track that is it. You can't download it again. Downloads are bundled in zip files and you've got 24 hours to redownload a zip bundle. After that, you're stuck. This happened to me where I assumed I already had a track and deleted the local copy (I empty recycling religiously) only to find out I was wrong. /sad trombone
3. You gotta dig and it takes time.

I've still got active BPM Supreme and Heavy Hits memberships. I don't think I'll be keeping them once they hit the end of their current month. I've also stopped trawling through Soundcloud and Hypeddit. I went from getting three to eight tracks a day using a combination of DDJP, Doing the Damage, BPM, Heavy Hits, Soundcloud, and Hypeddit to getting ten or more and having to pare it down from ZIP."
999,AITA for telling my dj coworker to back off from hijacking my decks and criticizing my set at a gig?,120,DJs,80,"I finally got a residency at a bar I have been trying to play for months just a few weeks ago. I play Friday nights while a guy who works for the same dj company I do plays Saturdays. He is in his 50‚Äôs and has been djing for way longer than I have (I‚Äôm 23). Every time I have played at this bar I have packed the floor and had people chant for an encore so I am familiar with this crowd and know what they like and how to get them hyped. 

Anyway my coworker stopped in tonight to watch me and I let him hang out with me in the booth. I was kind of put off when he told me to move over while he mixed a few tracks without asking me permission if he could. After he went to grab a drink he started texting me that I went into a ‚Äúhood‚Äù rap set far too early in the night and that I should make more of an effort to blend my tracks better despite the fact that I was key and beatmatching and mixing in each song at least 8 bars before i made a full switch. 

Later, he came back up to the booth and hijacked my controller again and kept criticizing everything I was doing. The last straw for me was when I saw him load up a track I was hoping to save for later in the night. I told him not to play it because I wanted to save it and he went ahead and mixed it anyway. I then told him that while I appreciate his feedback and recognize that he has been doing this way longer than me, he was overwhelming me and that I wanted him to leave me alone. He told me to relax and have fun and that he never intended to piss me off, but that I needed to listen to him and learn from him. He could then see me become visibly upset and started apologizing and telling me I was doing a good job afterall. After we went b2b on a couple more songs, he finally left me alone and left the bar without saying goodbye, which is unlike him as he is usually very friendly. 

I look up to this guy a lot and worry that I came off as sensitive and unteachable, but like I said before I worked my ass for this residency and feel like he had no business ‚Äúschooling‚Äù me on the spot like that, especially when he will be playing that same venue the following day and has had his residency there for years while this is finally my time to shine. I still get nervous at the beginning of my sets but once I get into the flow I‚Äôm good for the night. His barging in like that threw me off and stopped me from getting out of my head. Once he left I felt better and had a great rest of the night, but I cant stop thinking about how much better it would have been had he not intruded like that. Thoughts?"

6,First time using Algoriddim‚Äôs DJay Pro at a gig. I‚Äôm impressed.,76,DJs,59,"So I forgot my laptop at home for one of my residencies tonight. I could have gone home to grab it, but decided to give dj pro a try cause I had all the required adaptors, and had a decent collection of music still on my iPhone 12 Pro Max. I was djing off a Rane 72 and a single Rane Twelve and it was pretty flawless.


Plus there‚Äôs tidal support, which btw, I haven‚Äôt updated to the dj plan yet and it still worked - with stems and everything.

Low key restaurant gig so no real pressure but I did play for 4.5 hour. I haven‚Äôt used the program since like 2020

And holy shit did this program perform! 

I‚Äôm a serato dj through and through - and have been using the software since 2007 and I figured it out pretty quickly despite not using it in 4 years.

There a couple key features that I miss from Serato, and a few performance/design/mapping issues that bugged me, but i was really impressed by the overall experience.

I definitely enjoyed it more than playing o cdjs and even the denon gear.

I‚Äôve been hoping a dvs standalone solution that I thought would be in the form of a mixer with usb support, but I think djay pro is going to be the equivalent of usbs and cdjs for turntable/dvs djs.

Bring a phone, cables, headphones, and adapter if needed and you‚Äôre golden‚Ä¶"
8,Is it off or is it just me? ,4,DJs,43,"So I‚Äôve been playing out a couple years not but have been about he scene a bit longer with generally just being a fan. One of the things you get to learn obviously is how people get themselves on the bill. And we‚Äôre talking here just your good local venues not big warehouse project nights or touring events.

Everyone gets in different ways. Very common to see people running events who put the same three mates on everytime, I get it. Another is maybe the venue owner puts their friends on every weekend, not many else get a look in. I get that. And then the rest of us are left to just put ourselves out there in hopes or  through becoming known slowly you get an opportunity to showcase your stuff at event once in a while. 

One I don‚Äôt understand is how sometimes there‚Äôs like that one guy who‚Äôs on every single event poster. Like every single one. I know loads of good DJs who aren‚Äôt getting this much play time in the local scene. Like are they just impeccably good at networking like what‚Äôs going on that everyone wants them on their thing? My brain isn‚Äôt computing what‚Äôs happening there? Or are they just good? I still feel a bit naive at times about how some things can work so not sure if theres something else to it that I‚Äôm not grasping or it‚Äôs just simply good DJing. 

Any one seen people get gigs for ridiculous reasons? I‚Äôm intrigued to know if there‚Äôs things I‚Äôm naive too "

22,Study: Shifts in song lyrics in the last 4 decades,91,DJs,46,"My fellow music nerds, listen up:

This recent study analyzed a sample of 12000 songs spanning 40 years. The findings confirmed an ongoing trend of lyrics becoming simpler and more repetitive.

What's new and somehow not surprising: They also found shifts in the lyrical content. Mood wise lyrics became less happy, more sinister. And the use of self relating words (I, me, myself, ...) has risen, hinting at a more self focussing attitude in society.

They‚Äôre using Denon SC6000M decks, as someone who‚Äôs used to CDJs is there anything I need to be aware of beforehand? I understand all decks function in basically the same way, just curious if there are any quirks to the Denons that are likely to trip me up.

Or should I just play House, wich I still fairly like, seeing how I would get 50x the gigs?

38,Ways to deal with needle skips / train wrecks when mixing vinyl in front of a crowd?,21,DJs,83,"Hi,

I want to start mixing vinyl at raves in the near future, after always doing it digitally. I've been mixing vinyl at home for a few years, but that's always in a more controlled setting with a stable table etc. I was wondering, what are some ways of dealing with needle skips, or just absolute train wrecks of a transition when playing in front of 100+ people? Two recent cases which I picked up at an all vinyl rave;

* The needle got stuck in a loop and skipped during a track. After around 3 iterations the DJ accelerated the record quickly right when the skip would happen and 'dragged' the record out of the loop. 
* DJ was working on a transition but everytime he was about to blend the new track in, the original track skipped, causing the tracks to no longer play in sync. He then immediately cut away the new track, beatmatched it and then tried again. Original track kept skipping. Above happened 3-4 times. Eventually he just pressed the stop button of the original track, let the track come to a full brake and just started the new record from the beginning. Despite the 'fuck up' the crowd was cheering a lot!
* Can't find a link on youtube so excuse the facebook link, but [this](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=299175728054417) needle skip fix by Fjaak is really cool. They just hit the turntable at the right time causing the needle to hop over the skipping point.

  
Would love to hear your stories or tricks to handling these situations! "
41,I've been asked to DJ where there is no power source,28,DJs,92,"Hey everyone!

I've hit a bit of a snag with an upcoming event I'm involved in.

I've been asked to DJ for a local running event right here in our hometown. The twist? It's set along a trail that winds through the forest, off the beaten path. The event organizer has requested that I set up amidst the trees and provide a lively soundtrack to keep the runners motivated as they pass by‚Äîthink cheering, name-calling through the mic, the whole nine yards.

However, there's a challenge: there's no power source I can connect to. I have a Soundboks speaker and DDJ FLX4 that are easily carried to the spot I'm supposed to be in (can't get there by car).

Now, here's where I could use some advice: Is there a way for me to link up the controller with the speaker without a power outlet? Through the battery? Perhaps via a phone or iPad to the controller? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

A few months ago I upgraded to a prime 4+ from a pair of CDJs 2k/DJM 900nxs after one of my CDJs melted and ever since I upgraded I've been struggling to convert my work flow over to thr new hardware.  I'm at the point where it feels like I don't even know how to DJ anymore because I can't make the hardware do what's in my head let alone get into a flow state.  Don't get me wrong I don't think it's the prime 4s fault I just don't know if I'm mentally compatible with it."
48,On the nature of djing nowadays,71,DJs,87,"We mostly focus on the technical/skill/talent/competence aspect of djing. I‚Äôve been thinking more about the other side of djing, the social status/ clout chasing element. I feel like I just don‚Äôt understand it. No one likes to talk about it, but it really does feel like a popularity contest when we really get down to it. Some djs are more artistically motivated than others. But it‚Äôs impossible to ignore the forces at work. There are so many young kids just looking for attention and social status and to party with famous hot people. Obviously there are little pockets in each scene where people try to filter out that energy and enjoy a more communal experience that values authenticity. When we get more into the commercial side of the scene, obviously streaming numbers and ticket sales are what make the difference. But what about the less commercial side of djing? Is it more based on who you know? Or how long you‚Äôve been around? How do you get your foot in the door when you‚Äôre just a normal dude without a huge following or critical acclaim? Do local venues just see how many followers you have on IG and decide like that?"
49,what tempo do you cruise at when trying to build a vibe?,0,DJs,48,"i‚Äôll preface this question by saying it‚Äôs obviously very dependent on rhythm and musical style, but if you had to generalise, what tempo do you cruise at when trying to build a vibe?


please also mention if you generally play in particular styles/genres and if you mean in a bar/club context 



i‚Äôve been playing regularly at this local bar which has a nice energetic atmosphere and a chunky sub (an RCF system - a bit ‚Äòpointy‚Äô to my ears, but gets things done:) generally i like to start around crunchy instrumental hip hop tempos and then into 105-115 funky crunchy electronic beats (breaks, house, techno, electro and disco)‚Ä¶. and then i like to move around, jumping between 120-135 (doing sections of them). and i enjoy dipping into some 140, both straighter and more dubstep leaning (i mean proper more mnml dubstep). and if the night calls for some 150bpm madness and some footwork/jungle, all the better!

anyway‚Ä¶. im wondering if im spending too much time in hip hop tempo‚Ä¶.? i‚Äôve noticed i could use more tunes around 110bpm

these sets are (unfortunately) being played on CDJ-350s (i have & love my 2000s and Technics at home). 350s are fucking difficult to ‚Äòmake a story‚Äô with. the displays suck, like playing on a calculator. but the gigs are fun once a vibe has been built:) i‚Äôll always improvise in these gigs, which keeps things interesting (for me, anyway!). tonight i blended Kraftwerk with some Norwegian abstract house (if i remember correctly). about 40 years of electronic music in 7 mins? üòé

just curious what others do to build a vibe üòé

53,Almost had a terrible gig today but somehow turned it around,33,DJs,21,"Some context:

I consider myself a beginner DJ because I only really started DJing back in September 2023. I use Virtual DJ with a DDJ200 mainly because I come from a lower class family and don't really have the money to get Serato or upgrade my equipment. I've played at school events, a few birthday parties and at some cafes/ lounges and people always say I'm good at DJing. My friend hired me for my biggest gig yet a few weeks ago, a yacht party which was earlier today.

So I reached there half an hour early to set up. One thing to note is that when I've needed to use my own equipment at venues where a controller isn't provided, because the DDJ 200 doesn't have audio output, I always carry a 3.5mm to dual 1/4 inch splitter with me that I connect through my laptop aux to a mixer. When I got to the yacht today and started setting up I realized that the yacht's sound system didn't use a mixer with the input I needed. The company who owned the yacht provided me a controller though, a DDJ1000SRT, which I quickly downloaded the drivers for and started trying to get used to. That was when I hit my biggest roadblock: because all the DJs who the yacht company employed used Serato, the mapping was all over the place for me. Deck A gave me no problems, but the knobs for Deck B weren't mapped for VDJ at all. 

By the time I realized this, the party was supposed to start in 15 minutes so I started freaking out. I tried restarting my laptop, redownloading the drivers and going through everything in the VDJ settings and I still couldn't fix the mapping. People started coming on to the yacht and the employees said I needed to start playing music at the point, so I gave up and loaded up my tracks. My first few transitions were really basic but in around 10 minutes I started to get the mapping. Although there were still a few features in the software that the mapping on the controller didn't allow me to use, I started using some new techniques for mixing that I've never used before and slowly started to adapt. Despite how awful the set started out it ended as possibly my best set yet. 

I guess I'm just trying to say that I learnt an extremely important lesson today despite my good set: ALWAYS CHECK WITH THE VENUE ABOUT WHAT THE SETUP IS LIKE. Most people in this subreddit most likely already do that, but for those who don't you definitely need to start."
59,AITA for telling my dj coworker to back off from hijacking my decks and criticizing my set at a gig?,121,DJs,80,"I finally got a residency at a bar I have been trying to play for months just a few weeks ago. I play Friday nights while a guy who works for the same dj company I do plays Saturdays. He is in his 50‚Äôs and has been djing for way longer than I have (I‚Äôm 23). Every time I have played at this bar I have packed the floor and had people chant for an encore so I am familiar with this crowd and know what they like and how to get them hyped. 

Anyway my coworker stopped in tonight to watch me and I let him hang out with me in the booth. I was kind of put off when he told me to move over while he mixed a few tracks without asking me permission if he could. After he went to grab a drink he started texting me that I went into a ‚Äúhood‚Äù rap set far too early in the night and that I should make more of an effort to blend my tracks better despite the fact that I was key and beatmatching and mixing in each song at least 8 bars before i made a full switch. 

Later, he came back up to the booth and hijacked my controller again and kept criticizing everything I was doing. The last straw for me was when I saw him load up a track I was hoping to save for later in the night. I told him not to play it because I wanted to save it and he went ahead and mixed it anyway. I then told him that while I appreciate his feedback and recognize that he has been doing this way longer than me, he was overwhelming me and that I wanted him to leave me alone. He told me to relax and have fun and that he never intended to piss me off, but that I needed to listen to him and learn from him. He could then see me become visibly upset and started apologizing and telling me I was doing a good job afterall. After we went b2b on a couple more songs, he finally left me alone and left the bar without saying goodbye, which is unlike him as he is usually very friendly. 

I look up to this guy a lot and worry that I came off as sensitive and unteachable, but like I said before I worked my ass for this residency and feel like he had no business ‚Äúschooling‚Äù me on the spot like that, especially when he will be playing that same venue the following day and has had his residency there for years while this is finally my time to shine. I still get nervous at the beginning of my sets but once I get into the flow I‚Äôm good for the night. His barging in like that threw me off and stopped me from getting out of my head. Once he left I felt better and had a great rest of the night, but I cant stop thinking about how much better it would have been had he not intruded like that. Thoughts?"

72,Mystery Speaker ID,8,DJs,13,"I recently attended a small concert in Seattle and was very impressed by the PA system that they had, yet I didn't recognize the logo on the speakers.

I've searched through several of my favorite retail outlets for equipment but came up dry as to what they were.   And yes I realize there is far more to getting amazing sound out of a PA than just ""what speakers did they use""  but this is one piece of the puzzle that I'm missing.

97,Lower Rate for Future Business,4,DJs,25,"So I just got off the phone with a potential client that asked if I could lower my (already low) rate after receiving my quote. He owns an event company and mentioned he already told his client the DJ budget would be $760 for the 8hr event from another DJ they were going to book quoted them. I quoted him $1000 for the 8hrs, taking into consideration that he mentioned they‚Äôre looking for another DJ for future events. 

Yes I know 1k is already way too low, and I told him my rate is already low for the size of this event (~800 people) but on precidence of working together on future events I am willing to do $800 + lighting rental costs for this event. 

My question is, was this a mistake? Should I have stayed firm on my rate and potentially lose a valuable lead with lots of future events? 

For context he approached me last summer when I was DJing for a golf tournament and mentioned he wanted to hire me for his events, so he already has proof of my skills and professionalism."

I guess DMC Championship is still a relevant event in the modern djing communty, but im trying to recall an specific set from the first decade (or maybe two first decades) where the DJ (and im not sure it was a solo dj or a team, actually think it was a team) they took all Vinyls off the turntables and then pitched the static sounds in order to create a melody with the crossfader. 

If im right that it was a team, they were a pretty strong one (in terms of the djing community back then) but i cant recall the name, and therefore cant find the set. Ive tried google and all the basics but since im not native english i cant find it (specially since there are Dj static and Dj noize that are the results that pop up when trying to search it).

It blew my mind back then and i unlocked the memory recently, but im growing desperate trying to find it 

So if anyone could share some light on it, it would be delightful.

So fellow DJs, when you are digging your tracks, do you often think about how it may sound with proper club gear and decide accordingly, or do you mainly make your decision just based on what you hear through the ""usual"" gear at your disposal such as headphones or lesser-than-club level home speakers?

I do the latter, and I am beginning to doubt that this is the right course of action. Of course, if it already sounds really good with my own gear, then I will be 99% sure that it is going to be awesome with the club gear, but then I suspect that I may be missing out a lot of good tracks.



It is a tricky situation though, if the track sounds OK with my own normal gear, is it a good idea to get it, betting that it's gonna be great in the club, or is it better to not step out of the secure zone of heavy filtering through what I have at home?"

144,Why is autogain so shamed when using Traktor? [see text],16,DJs,106,"So, it's a common refrain that only idiots or noobs use autogain with Traktor. I'm confused by this, and here's why. If you activate autogain, it attempts to set the gain for you. However, you can manually adjust the autogain level, and once you find the right level it is saved. I like this a lot. I manually determined the gain based on levels and perceived loudness, and that info is now saved with the track.

I get that it's pretty stupid to just blindly allow autogain to pick your levels (I can't think of a single example where I didn't adjust the gain manually), but I do not think it is stupid to have a saved gain level based on manual adjustments.

In the dead ass Traktor sub, and to my knowledge here as well, Traktor autogain is universally shit on, and nobody has even mentioned this aspect of using autogain.

Am I stupid?

152,DJ gigs at restaurants?,23,DJs,38,"I've been DJing  for about year now, with a few private parties and about 10 gigs at bars that have been pretty successful. These gigs were mostly Saturday afternoons, with a chill day-drinking vibe, and fine house music. The gigs (paid) went great and the owners were always satisfied.

Now, I'm looking to expand my horizons and venture into playing at restaurants. I've noticed a trend in some places, specially in bigger cities, where they're adding a bit of showmanship to the dining experience, like having dancers or circus performers. I've even seen[DJs mixing in restaurants](https://youtu.be/jDvvW0pf8wA?si=D-g65lHpwkQgjid9) on the internet and I love the idea. As a restaurant owner, it's for sure a cool way to add something extra to your place.

I'm curious if anyone here has experience with restaurant gigs. Specifically, I'm wondering about the practical side of things - do most restaurants have decent speakers, or do you need to bring your own gear? Did it take a lot of ""convincing"" to play there? Also, from a broader perspective, how do you view restaurant gigs as a DJ opportunity in general? Couldn't they be a fun and relatively low-effort way to make consistent money compared to the bigger bar and club gigs?

I have done some research and like the look of either a Traktor setup or a stand alone Numark Pro + but when I do some reading into each things get blurry. Especially from a compatibility standpoint with venues that might expect you to plug and play with their own equipment.

The genre I play most is DEEP TECH HOUSE (like Project 89, Kreech, Milion, Harrison BDP and so on) and these days I'm approaching the construction of a djset. I usually catalogue all my songs in the best way i can to play them ""in freestyle"", but sometimes doing like this don't give me the possibility to keep a mood or a ""story"" I want to tell with the music...or simply I don't understand if the flux have the right continuity or not. Somebody tell me, for example, to listen to the drums...that sometimes I started my sets with tracks with a too much ""detailed and complex"" drums...I cannot understand if it's a real important thing or not for people who listen to my gigs.

So here's the question: in your opinion, are there some elements that has to take in consideration (besides key and bpm, of course) to build a real story with music avoiding just putting music you like or that you think people could like most?

I know that everyone have a certain kind of musical taste and that a story belongs to those who tell it, but i think that there's maybe some ""rules"" to follow to keep coherence."
172,The Worst Mixer You Have Used,24,DJs,103,"I saw an Instagram video the other day of a DJ podcast where someone said the Rane TT57SL was the worst mixer they have used. Hard time believing that. Us DJs with more than 15+ years will know that mixer was a game changer, the first widespread mixer with a built in Serato dongle. Every pro DJ I knew in the late 2000s had that thing. I used it from 2009-2012 and could take it out of storage tomorrow for a gig if I wanted to. That being said, what is truly the worst mixer you have used? My vote goes to the Novation Twitch. I bought this when it came out thinking it would be a nice alternative for smaller bars. Unknown to have horrible output (manager of bar I played at actually commented that it sounded worse than my last mixer (the 57SL) and controls were awkward. That was the last time I bought anything USB powered too. Sold it just a few weeks after buying it."
175,How many DBs on the master out?,1,DJs,17,"I had a gig the other week and the sound guy told me to keep the mixer (DJM900nxs2) maxed to 0 DB during my set, which was only to the top of the green bars. I am used to having it maxed in the orange without redlining. I was under the impression I could have the mixer peaking just below the redline and that will keep the audio from distorting then the sound guy can adjust the master levels from their end. 

I noticed some DJ mixers like the DJMs go up to 10 db whereas others like the Rane Four only go up to 0 db.

So is it better to always have the master at 0 DB or should I go louder?  Why the inconsistency between mixers?

180,Recording a dj set in a club,21,DJs,90,"I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for a good quality external recording device that can be hooked up to a club mixer?

I'm currently using a zoom h1n but unless the input level is set really low, it has a tendency to clip badly.
It's fine for a studio environment but in a club where the levels tend to get pushed up higher it ends up sounding distorted.

Is there a better device available that has a bit more headroom so won't clip as easily?

Back in the day I used to use a mini disc and that was pretty much plug and play, with the internal limiter keeping the levels sounding good. Looking for something like that really.

Thanks!"
182,DJM V10 effects Level/depth knob issue,2,DJs,4,"hello everyone. I have had my DJM v10 since 2020 and I recently noticed that when using effects and turning the level/depth knob, whatever effect I am using cuts in and out.  

In observing it more and more, I noticed that the effect only cuts out when the knob itself is moved or forced in a downward direction. If I hold it an upward direction while I turn the knob,  the effects have no issue working.  I am guessing something has to be re soldered?  

I haven't found this issue described anywhere else and just thought id put this out there to help determine if this could potentially be an easy fix if i open it up myself or does it sound serious enough to send out for repaid at my certified retailer?

217,It's (almost) World Backup Day! Go back up your music library like right now (and also...),15,DJs,4,"So it's almost [world backup day](https://www.worldbackupday.com/en) (probably is in some parts of the world) so here's a reminder to go back up your music library. I might be saying this because something happened to me and not just because it's (almost) world backup day; see the note at the bottom.

Follow the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies of your data, on 2 different media, with 1 stored offsite.

My backups personally look like this:

\- 2 external SSD's which are mirrors which I carry to gigs (this satisfies the 2 different media rule)

\- 1 copy on my server at home (this satisfies the 3 copies part, as well as 2 different media in a slightly different way)

\- 1 copy in the cloud (I use Backblaze which this is *not* an advertisement for, there's lots of good options, this is just what I use! This satisfies the 1 offsite copy.)

This is a touch excessive, I know, but it has saved my butt more than once.

And actually, here's an extra tidbit: if you have the ability to *version* your backups, do so. I haven't paid for the versioned edition of Backblaze, but now I'm kinda sad as I realized that my Serato library has been corrupt for some time (missing a bunch of files). I've narrowed that down to about September of last year when I was having some serious drive issues, but I don't have a backup from then to be able to try to merge with my existing library.

Anyway, back up your stuff!"

240,Roland DJ 808 in 2024,5,DJs,13,"Hoping to get input on buying a used Roland DJ 808 in 2024. I know it‚Äôs a little dated when you think of the number of controllers that have been released since 2016, but my focus has been making beats for awhile now and the dj808 seems to be the best tool for the producer-DJ. I imagine I can sketch out beats from loops on serato and connect to my drum machine or use the 808 section to layer drums. There‚Äôs no other DJ hardware with a midi out. I‚Äôve also seen my two favorite producers use it up to even recently (Pete Rock and Alchemist), which shouldn‚Äôt matter but heck, I want to emulate my idols. 

My main concerns for the DJ 808 are that 1) it‚Äôs discontinued by Roland so finding replacement parts might be a hassle, 2) it‚Äôs not built like a brick (also considering a Rane One, which is a tank), 3) the producer set up I imagine will end up being too complicated to sketch out beats and I‚Äôm left with useless features (I like gorilla beat making on my sp-404)

The reason why the Rane One is appealing to me is because I imagine being more comfortable with it DJing at say a backyard function. It‚Äôs minimal, would be more natural for me to scratch with (used to use turntables for DJing way back when), and has a solid build for mobile use. For beat-making, it has an AUX in which is minimally all I need to sketch a beat out. 

TLDR: get the DJ 808 for its producing features even though it‚Äôs discontinued, or get something new and not worry about the producing aspect.

Definitely getting some new Turntables (work tables). Need a new mixer/controller. I need the hole 9 yards. I have a budget of 10k, to get me started. I need everything. My XONE :62 is still a beast.

My sound is a mix of trance, organic house, folktronica, dnb, with a splash of shrooms. I like to layer tracks heavily. Not into scratching. I don't want to press a bunch of buttons with stupid noises. I just want my vinyl to work along side my digital music and I want to be able to extremely refine the sound.

259,My DDJ-1000 decided it didn't want to turn on at my monthly event yesterday‚Ä¶,9,DJs,24,"I had used it just that morning before I unplugged evertything from it and packed all my gear in the car. Got to the bar, got all my gear setup, but since I got there early, I failed to power everything on until it was time for me to play. That was a mistake. I had this issue once before, and since I live less than a mile from the venue, I took the controller, cables and computer home for testing and it powered up just fine. At the time, I chalked it up to operator error (I figured I didn't seat the power or USB cable properly). But yesterday, I did the same thing and it would not power on despite trying different cables.

I think it's a hardware issue and I'm pissed at the design of the power adapter plug into the unit. I learned it's not good for consistent gigging aka constant plugging/unpluging of the power adapter. I've owned it since April of 2020 and despite the one hiccup last year. Since June of last year, I've used it in the wild - meaning I've had to plug/unplug it at least once a month to bring it to the bar.

Now, I'm looking at a XDJ-XZ or XDJ-RX3. I'd love to get a couple XDJ-1000mk2's and a DJM-750mk2, but since I'm trying to save for a home in the future, I can't really justify the cost of the modular setup. I do plan to eventually send the DDJ-1000 for repair. I hope it can be repaired because I'd like to use it as a backup. Lesson learned: HAVE A BACKUP IF YOU'RE GIGGING!

I'd LOVE to have a modular setup, but currently, I'm only playing the bar, streaming on Twitch, recording mixes a few times a year, and just mixing for fun whenever‚Ä¶ And if I start getting back to playing venues/events/clubs, I would probably be booked via a promoter, so they should have the pro gear (DJM-900nxs2/CDJ-3000s/etc.), so I just show up with my headphones and USB drives. I like having a 4-channel setup of the XZ but the RX3 seems more portable and has a much better screen - it's also $400 cheaper than the XZ. If I were to get the XZ, I would probably never get a modular system until the XZ dies lol.

Anyway, this long-ass post was to vent my frustration and any advice/suggestions would be great."

And I have been doing it for some quite time (few years). I'm not preforming a lot, but every 2-3 months I have something. Throughout the years I have encountered various problems with the system that I want to overcome.

1. My library is on external hard drive and I'm using MacOS. I had few times that I needed to change my computer to a new one. What I usually do is to just drag and drop the files into iTunes and then recreate the smart-playlists that I had, as well as playlists that I created (usually sets that I preformed / recorded). The thing is that the to recreate the smart-playlists is an annoying process which I need to remember the rules. What is the best way to overcome this? is there a way the library structure and playlist could be kept, so when I switch computer one day I can be sure that it will be an instant thing?
2. When I export in rekordbox I do it from iTuens API, I don't drag into rekordbox. What is the safest way to make sure I won't lose cue points that I set into Rekordbox? "

I remember reading an article mentioning that Bandcamp is working on bringing some features back or improving the discovery process, but details were a bit vague. Does anyone know if there's a timeline for when these features might return? It's been a bit frustrating trying to navigate through the platform without them.

Also, I can't help but wonder about the decision-making process behind removing such key features. It seemed like Bandcamp was on a good path toward enhancing music discovery. If anyone has insights or updates on this, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

272,Online DJings - What results in followers/audience?,8,DJs,10,"So I trip out sometimes how like well known artists and DJs don't have as many viewers on Twitch or Youtube as some no name DJ that we've never heard of. For instance, Lord Finesse streams every Saturday AM. He has like 300 - 400 people in his chat, and he's work with the likes of Big L, DJ Premier, and other well known people in hip hop. He's part of D.I.T.C and has a long history in music. But another unknown DJ I'll catch on Twitch has like 1k+ people watching him DJ. Same thing with Easy Mo Bee. He streams on Twitch late at night on Friday nights and Saturday nights, but he doesn't get many viewers from what I've seen. That guy has worked with Notorious BIG and many other well known artists.

There's other examples of that, so I was wondering like what gets you an audience on Twitch or Youtube? Are these no name guys just marketing and advertising their stream on social media more/better or what? What do you guys/gals think about it? Peace and stay up!"
273,Recording Vinyl for playing out on XDJ/CDJ's,1,DJs,5,"Hi all

Looking for some advice on the best way to go about recording some of my records with my current setup for use at gigs. I do buy digital copies of everything i can get hold of online, or buy the tracks on CD & rip if there is a cd release available. Some of my older music, white labels etc ive not been able to find so would like to rip them from wax. Setup is as follows -

Pioneer XDJ-XZ
2 x Reloop RP7000 Mk2
Reloop Concorde carts & stylii (i believe they are just rebadged Ortofon Pro S Mk1)
Focusrite Scarlett 4i4 3rd gen interface
Macbook Pro Mid 2012 & MSI Windows gaming laptop with Serato Dj Pro, Ableton, Garageband & Audacity
2 x 'classic' Technics-style headshells with Stanton 500 carts (i dont think the stylii are genuine Stanton, most probably copies)

Ive tried recording direct from vinyl to USB stick on the XZ & it sounds ok, not sure how well the recordings will hold up next to 'new' digital wav's & mp3's on a big system. I'm using the turntables thru the 'Line' inputs on the XZ as they have line-level output as well as phono (presuming line level is the way to go as Pioneer's phono pre-amps seem to be regarded as poor).

Have also tried recording through the Scarlett to computer & to me the recordings sounded a lot more 'flat' & quieter than direct to USB.

There's so much info online about this its pretty overwhelming, most of it from 'audiophile' types rather than gigging dj's. Should i buy a vinyl cleaning machine? What cart & stylus to use? Do i need an expensive phono pre-amp? Cork or rubber turntable mats? So much info i just dunno where to start üòµ‚Äçüí´

Would be nice to get some ideas from working dj's who have had decent results playing vinyl rips alongside digital downloads on club systems.

I play House/Garage/UKG so decent bass & crisp vocals from the recordings are a must. Thanks for reading üëçüèª

276,"had my worst gig in a while, here are some crucial lessons",63,DJs,69,"First 2 are classics I cant believe I fell for:

ALWAYS have a backup laptop

NEVER update 2 days before a gig

the crowd doesn't really care at all as long as there's any music playing (Sofyware keeps crashing? just DJ the files raw thru a media player)

If you're very tall, point that out to the organizer so they'll get you a fitting table to set up on - will save you a lot of lower back pain

When asking someone for a slice of pizza midset, don't say ""I don't mind the topping"" that's how you end up with pineapple pizza

I know there's a lot of debate around what is and what isn't deep house - I'm not particularly keen on the stuff filling up Beatport etc, but I am happy to be swayed. My only rule is: no EDM.

Let me paint the picture for you....So, I'm a DJ and producer from India and have been active in my local scene for 2 years now. I like making & playing house music and really melodic stuff. Recently, I've been offered a full time residence at a bar. The pay is good and I was really considering to take it. But the owner wants me to quit playing what I like and play all the generic bollywood music. 

I really don't like playing those songs and recently it's starting to feel like I'm getting outcasted because of that reason. The scene in my city is really closed off for any newcomer and the only way to get any gigs is by compromising what you love playing and do what the promoter wants you to do. 

I'm really struggling financially and I've now faced with this situation of either giving up on my music or be bullied by the promoters to get whatever gigs they offer me.

321,How many of you started with career goal in a specific genre but ended up completely different environment,10,DJs,22,"Hey dj's, like the title says, how many of you started playing a specific genre and wanting to build a career out of it but the path you took landed you on a completely different genre and environment.

&#x200B;

Fo example I started thanks to the EDM madness on 2012 by watching the Tomorrowland aftermovies and also thanks to Avicii so my dream was to be a EDM dj and nowadays I am mostly multi genre.

A bit different from what I imagined. As soon as some friends and family knew I was djing they started to invite me to birthdays and that type of parties where you don't play what you want but what the crowd wants so I started to build a huge library of all kind of music and I'm actually a good selector and crowd reader so that kind of gives me joy to see people dancing and reacting to I'm doing.

&#x200B;

I still play electronic music when I can because thats where my heart is but I got more gigs in a multi genre environement and also I earn way more money out of it."

325,Underground Rave !!,1,DJs,45,"Hey all, 

So i‚Äôm planning on throwing an underground rave / bush doof in some nearby parklands in over a months time. I have some experience in planning and organising events before but none of this scale. I‚Äôm planning to have around 500 people there, the event will be outdoors obviously and will involve quite a bit of effort. It will go from about 10pm to sunrise, to give us a chance to clean up while it‚Äôs light. 

I‚Äôm here to mainly ask about equipment. My friend has XDJ XZ for decks which should be fine as i‚Äôm not interested in renting CDJS for this. I have about 5 djs lined up for the night so far and was wondering if a few more would be good or should I have longer sets instead? 

I‚Äôm also interested on some advice of sound system and lighting requirements. I‚Äôve lined up 2x QSC KW152 speakers and 4x EV ETX18SP subwoofers which I think should do the trick. 

In terms of lighting, i‚Äôm thinking of getting some red / purple wash lighting and an AVE ECLIPSE CLUB 1000MK2 for lasers. The lasers will be slightly angled to avoid them pointing to the sky and endangering air traffic. I‚Äôd love some recommendations on specific wash lights that could be suitable for hire for the event. 

The main thing I need advice on is a generator. I‚Äôve constantly been told an inverter is much better in this situation so that‚Äôs probably what i‚Äôm going to go for. I was just wondering with the above information how much power would the generator need? I‚Äôve been recommended 6000-8000W, would this be ok?

I have a 6x3 Metre gazebo organised to cover the dj and equipment and am going to put 5x 2x2 Metre temporary steel fencing in front of the dj and speakers to protect the equipment from drink spills / other issues. 

I‚Äôve organised a team of around 10+ so far for setup, security, crowd control and medial assistance. 

I‚Äôm planning to have about 300+ water bottles available for those in need as this won‚Äôt cost too much and i‚Äôm sure would be helpful. We have prepared a bunch of garbage bags for the cleanup afterwards and i‚Äôm planning to place some temporary bins around the area to try and reduce the inevitable rubbish issue in the first place. 

30 days before the event I‚Äôll create a private instagram account and gatekeep the location until on the day to avoid police presence and unwanted patrons. The location is quite far from houses and I am doing everything in my power to prevent this from being shut down by police and to be a safe and fun night for all. 

That‚Äôs about it for now, id really appreciate some recommendations and advice from people with or without experience in this area. 

Apologies for formatting typed on phone, thanks !!

Edit 1 -

344,effect station with 4-8 beat loop ?,3,DJs,12,"Hello, I am looking for an effect gear, like the rmx-1000 but with a looper capable of doing 4 or more beats, since rmx-1000 can only loop 2 beat.   
I am trying to emulate the function on the xone db4, that can loop 4 beats so is possible to operate effects on the loop while the song still going on playing in another channel.   
My xone db4 unfotunately appear to output kind of a metalic sound, I dont know why, so I think i am going to change it.  
My current setup is  Denon SC6000 -> xone db4 (loop+effect on single channels) -> rmx-1000  (effects on master)  
My idea for the new setup, if i find the right effect station is do this:  
DenonSC6000  ch1 -> effect station 1-> mixer   
Denon SC6000 ch2 -> effect station 2 -> mixer

347,Phase new remotes... better???,7,DJs,1,"I've had Phase since it came out pretty much. I just replaced the 2nd remote recently, and I'm noticing the newer remotes haven't formed hairline cracks like the originals did and the battery life is very good on them. 

My original remotes had battery issues from jump street pretty much. For those of you that have gotten the new single/one-off replacement remotes that Phase offers, does the build quality seem better to you?  My originals formed hairline cracks pretty quick and the spindle ring was coming off sometimes on both pucks.

The new remotes seem a lot better. Maybe it's my imagination, but it wouldn't surprise me if Phase improved them without advertising it to avoid jaded users demanding free replacements. What say you? TIA for replies. Peace!"
349,ZipDj Record pool quality control,8,DJs,35,"Hey guys,

I‚Äôve recently grabbed a load of tracks from zipdj. Some of them are clearly, without any doubt really low quality in terms of sound output, like terrible in comparison to other tracks. (I‚Äôll dig through and compare them properly at some point) 

I was messing about at home the other day, just mixing anything and everything as I do and not putting any thought or effort into things, just literally getting to know my music.

So I‚Äôm not paying too much attention and I mix in a track to find its stupidly quiet and muffled, it honestly sounds like a terrible rip.

Is it safe to assume zipdj and maybe other pools don‚Äôt give a shit and just want volumes of audio?

On a side note, any record pools offering lossless quality?

Thanks 


Edit*

Sorry guys, I‚Äôm now guilty of not providing enough info.

I found a track that‚Äôs a good example of my issue, it‚Äôs not the same one, but boy does it sound shit!

Just to be clear, this was downloaded directly from ZipDJ, yet a it‚Äôs a remix of an older song but I fail to see how that‚Äôs relevant in terms of audio quality?

If anyone has zipdj, please feel free to search the following track
Amigos (EP) Let‚Äôs Kick It (Original Mix) - Fer BR, Paco Osuna, Inglesias, Manu Gonzalez- [54765607]

Spek won‚Äôt install on either my Mac or MacBook.

Fakin the funk lists this particular file as 128kbps - the frequency spectrum showing a fairly consistent audio file but at 16,540.

 Not that it matters, but to offer some insight, I‚Äôm a techno dj, but grabbing a load of house tech and other stuff for a yacht party which is why I‚Äôm grabbing loads of tech house and other genres I wouldn‚Äôt normally, I also purchase everything I play at festivals in AIFF format normally but on occasion I‚Äôll use a 320kbps mp3, this audio file I absolutely wouldn‚Äôt / couldn‚Äôt though.

358,A ‚Äúhood DJ‚Äù,80,DJs,97,"Hello everyone. A DJ on the East Coast. Started a year and a half ago and went through the ranks. I main gig was a college bar in which turned to a club on certain nights and this gig is through a company. The college bar is located smack dead in the city so we have both college kids and local adults. The gig is 8pm-1am , college kids usually get there early and leave around 11 then the locals start coming in. Me personally, I play for everyone, I play all types of music from house, house-pop, edm, country, singalongs, and then rap. Unfortunately, starting in January a lot of people have started fighting towards the end of the night. Now I‚Äôm one of the top djs on the Main Street , very popular with students and locals. Unfortunately, I had consecutive fights towards the end of the night. I‚Äôve played ‚Äúlove‚Äù by keyshia cole and girls started fighting‚Ä¶ long story short 2 weeks ago there was a huge fight and the bar was fined. The management and even my boss (owner of the company) blamed me calling me a ‚Äúhood dj‚Äù‚Ä¶ they explained my style (talking on the mic to get the crowd going) and the fact I play rap I‚Äôm a hood dj who attracts ‚Äúthe wrong crowd‚Äù Even worst they agreed that I need to take the blame and ‚Äúfall on the sword‚Äù ‚Ä¶ it hurt and I was pretty upset. I played rnb and singalongs  for an hour , yet still a fight‚Ä¶. when I looked back at my playlist for those weeks I played more pop than rap.. the other dj played more rap.. how would you guys go about this ? I feel I‚Äôm being attacked because I‚Äôm the only black dj who‚Äôs playing urban music and getting people who like that music‚Ä¶ felt not even my boss had my back ‚Ä¶ sorry for the long rant "
360,Thoughts on Aslice and Support The Sound?,4,DJs,15,"I can't stop thinking about [this article I read on RA](https://ra.co/news/80412), and just want to hear other peoples' takes. It's about how a number of clubs and festivals (including Basement and Wire Festival) are launching an initiative called Support The Sound which aims to ""lessen the wage gap between DJs and producers through tracklist reporting"" with Aslice. DJs playing at clubs/events that are part of this initiative will be asked to share a percentage of their revenue with producers/artists whose tracks they played during their set, which Aslice suggests as 5% or more of the DJ's gig fee.

5% is not a ton, especially from a $100-$400+ gig, and I'm not exactly sure how they're dividing it up from there. Though it seems that there is already a system in place to get these producers royalties from performances of their tracks, and that would be through the PROs (ASCAP, BMI, PRS, etc.).

Every club pays an amount per year to the PROs for a blanket license. My understanding is that writers (the artist/""producer"" in this case) get paid out from this pot of money. I got this from the Donald Passman book ""All You Need To Know About The Music Business"":

>The \[PROs\] pay based on domestic concert performances, but it's only for the top three hundred grossing tours as reported in a magazine called *Pollstar*. The PROs distribute money based on **set lists**...which they get from either the venues or the artist's management...If you're performing in coffee houses and small venues, these aren't tracked separately, but both BMI and ASCAP have programs for you to submit your materials and get paid something.

Now it's my understanding that writers who do not meet the ""top three hundred"" criteria get paid from this blanket license pool of money, though I could very well be wrong. It would make sense that if there is already a way to submit your setlists to the PROs so they can pay out these producers, then shouldn't the focus shift to there? This would require more emerging producers to make sure they're affiliated with a PRO, but why wouldn't someone want to do that. Aslice currently charges $10 per playlist (setlist) submission, but they do pay out 85% to producers. I should note that Aslice states on their website that they're not there to replace the PROs, but to act as an additional revenue source.

It feels like through this model, producers who have already registered their songs with a PRO could be getting paid twice for the same performance, though once at the expense of the DJ. Let me just say I believe artists/writers/producers should be getting paid for performances of their works. We should be buying tracks, paying for tickets to shows, etc. This initiative almost comes across as venues passing the buck off to performers, while co-opting social justice/economic justice language to juice their audiences, especially given this quote from the RA article ""the role of music producers has been marginalised and undervalued.""

I wouldn't be surprised if a major factor in some clubs embracing this model would be because they've made a deal with Aslice, the same way a venue will partner with one primary ticketing platform for a sum of money (I've seen instances where that number is in the tens-of-thousands).

Another major question would be whether the playlist submission fee is covered by the venue (which it either won't be, or it will be deducted from the DJ's pay), and if DJ's will be getting paid more as well.

Again, it's only 5% of the DJ's earnings. Playlist submission is only $10. All-in-all, producers should be compensated, I'm not saying they shouldn't, and more music makers should educate themselves on the business. DJs should be paid fairly, and the entire responsibility of this issue is not the DJ's alone. It's entirely possible that this creates a situation that frames this as a problem handed to the DJ's to remedy, rather than part of a larger issue.

Thoughts?"

The upgrade mentioned is about my laptop since my desktop boasts a Ryzen 7 5800x which is good beef.

The laptop has a Ryzen 3 3200u(2C/4T) with 12 gigs of ram and a 256ssd(small i know but upgradable)  
The upgrade im thinking about is a laptop with a Ryzen 5(4C/8T) 7520u but only 8 gigs of RAM

I plan to use this laptop only for DJing and would like to know if it would be alright for some 3-4 years or if i should either stick to the Ryzen 3 or look into intel for a change.

Sadly my max budget is around 400$ for a laptop and i will either go for a used gaming laptop this new chip, or stick with the oldie.

424,Allen & Heath Xone:96 + Eventide H90 | Info and Appreciation Post,11,DJs,7,"After long consideration and research I decided for an Eventide H90 to replace both my Boss DD-7 and Boss RV-6 effect pedals to augment my Xone 96 mostly used for DJing electronic music. It was recommended from time to time, alongside alternatives like the Boss GT-1000 and the Line 6 Helix, but I did not find explicit information to which capacity it could work with the mixer. I had hopes that I could use it in dual stereo mode as both a send-return device (like the previous pedals) and a master insert (like the RMX-1000) and not only is that indeed possible, it goes even further than that.

How I set it up:

* connect H90 1/2 in to Xone 96 SND A, H90 1/2 out to Xone 96 RTN A - ensure output is set to Line level, not Hi-Z one Xone 96 and to Line level on H90 as well
* connect H90 3/4 in to Xone 96 MASTER INSERT SND, H90 3/4 out to Xone 96 MASTER INSERT RTN
* [enable dual routing in H90](https://cdn.eventideaudio.com/manuals/h90/1.7.1/content/edit-modes/routing.html#dual-routing) and choose an appropriate routing path for the effects setup
   * Pre/Post allows for using effect A for the SND/RTN chain, effect B in the master insert
   * Presets A & B in Series/Parallel on Path 1 allows for using both effects (independently) on SND/RTN
   * Presets A & B in Series/Parallel on Path 2 allows for using both effects (independently) on master insert

This works absolutely flawlessly and the resulting sound is incredible, leagues above what I was used to with the previous pedals and absolutely no degradation in the beautifully warm Xone 96 sound quality.

What I was not aware about before is that routing can be adjusted on-the-fly. Thus, two effects can be used on SND/RTN for one track, one for SND/RTN and one for the master insert during a transition and both on master insert when crafting complex compositions of multiple tracks.

Only downside I currently see for DJ use is that there only is one global tempo setting (like on the RMX-1000) and it only supports full bpm steps, no fractional steps. As far as I'm aware, the built-in MIDI clock of the H90 cannot be fed with the Xone 96's MIDI outputs, but setting it manually is surprisingly easy using the rotary knobs compared to the tap-based bpm control I was used to on the pedals, though that is available as an option as well.

It could also be used to feed both A and B SND/RTN chains, but that would lead to the loss of the master insert functionality. As effects can be customized on-the-fly on the H90 anyway, I did not see any benefit in this. The H90 Control app is surprisingly easy to use, but the pedal has so insanely many customization options that there's probably no ever being 'done' setting it up."

Im in Canada and promoter doesn't know wtf does that mean, we're trying to reach the person throwing the party but i wanna start digging for tracks right away.

So far I was thinking : Garage, dnb, breakbeats, euro 4/4 (130-145bpm). Maybe a some techno in there and a LOT of drill acapellas and or recognizable vocals ala flowdan.

Any ideas to interpret ""Uk vibes""?


:UPDATE: Alright, well, thanks for an absolutely MASSIVE amount of very good recommendations!

 but unfortunately, it seems like the host saw Fred again and Chase & status's Boiler room, and that's his UK vibe. So, nothing too ""deep"", and promoters want to keep it appealing to a larger crowd

So what i'll be going for is ""sub genre mainstream"" as i 
like to call it. So Basically, play very popular tracks they probably heard from sub genres they mostly barely know. To make them feel like they're experiencing ""underground"" music even tho it's garage or dnb anthems. Also throw in some night bass since they'll most likely know this as well.

 I'll be digging in your recommendations, so far found some good stuff. And some really neat stuff for my fun lil' personal collection.

457,New Tidal plan will bring back Stems,43,DJs,37,"From support:

467,Building an app to book DJs?,9,DJs,18,"
Not advertising. 

I‚Äôm a software engineering student and as a class project my roommate and I built a (shitty) app to let DJs advertise clips of their sets.

It‚Äôs supposed to match people throwing house parties with local DJ listings so they can book and pay ahead of time through the app.

My DJ friends were super stoked and want us to develop it into a full working network.

I‚Äôm assuming there‚Äôs a reason ‚ÄúUber for DJs‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist already. Can anyone tell me what could go wrong with an app like this?

Alternatively, is this something that DJs would actually be interested in?"
469,Tidal Pricing Updated for DJs,3,DJs,26,"Exciting news for Audiophiles is that Tidal HiFi will now drop to the same price as Tidal's base subscription for an individual plan of $11/month as of April 10, 2024. Not so great for those who use Tidal with software such as Serato, VirtualDJ, or Algoriddum djay Pro is that Tidal will add $9 monthly to the base subscription.  As per the digital trends article, ""*For those who want to be able to access the Tidal library via* [*software- and hardware-based DJ tools*](https://tidal.com/djs)*, an add-on fee of $9 per month will be needed.*""

Over the past couple of months, Serato and djay Pro removed the ability to use Stems; separate tracks for voice, drums, and rhythm with Tidal's streaming music because they say it falls within a different licensing/copyright tier. Could this additional $9 per month bring back the ability to use Stems with Tidal? Or is this just a new DJ tax for the privilege to connect Tidal streaming?  


Apple Music recently became available on djay Pro without increasing its subscription cost. My take is that Tidal is going to use the additional $9 from DJs to bring back Stems which would be pretty awesome. What do you think?

470,Issue of recording a mix with Tascam Dr 40,9,DJs,66,"Hi everyone i just bought a tascam dr 40 to record mix. My mixer is xone DB2 

After watching some youtube tutorials i set up the tascam based on the videos' instruction. Im pretty firm that i follow all the instruction and set up the record mode and everything correctly on the tascam. 

However the tascam is recording external audio and background noise, it doesn't record the internal soundcard output. 

I tried to connect the tascam to record out and then the booth out output on the mixer, every time it still record background noise and external audio again.  

I use the cable TRS to same dual 1/4 to connect the tascam to booth out output
I used the TRS jack to Dual RCA to connect the tascam to record out output  

I think i used the WRONG cables so the tascam keeps recording background noise and external audio? 

I do some research, and i think should i plug tbe RCA male to XLR male cable or 1/4 TS to Dual RCA cable into record out output on the mixer (pics of those 2 cable included)  then this will work correctly for the Tascam to record internal soundcard output and no more background noise, external audio? 

Any tips will be really appreciated since i been struggle a lot with this issue recently. Thank you"

500,Latest OBS Beta supports Pioneer DJM-S7 (And probably other USB mixers) as an audio source,7,DJs,38,"Last night I decided to have another look at getting audio from my S7 into OBS (Previously I found a hack on my S9 which involved connecting the 2nd USB cable to my mac, and for some reason that worked, but this didn't work on the S7)  


I wanted to avoid having to use an external soundcard, and the official instructions on the Pioneer website which involved using Soundflower, Jack and creating aggregate devices etc seemed unnecessarily complicated - after all Ableton is able to see multiple inputs from the S7, with channels 5/6 being the REC out, so why can't OBS?   


So, I hopped on the OBS discord channel, and asked that very question, and as fate would have it a helpful chap called PatTheMav replied:  


>""This will be possible in the new version - you can try the beta and use the channel mapping by disabling downmixing on the audio input source""

502,"I DJ for partner dances- My Truthear SHIO gets super noisy randomly, looking to replace- what are some good options currently?",2,DJs,22,"Started with a Dragonfly black and Schitt Fulla 3- (I nearly have never used the Fulla)

Lost the Dragonfly black which served me extremely well for DJ'ing, replaced it with a Truthear SHIO- which sound wise is solid and has been good at boosting Signal Noise Ratio for tracks - BUT i've  now noticed randomly, there seem to be dropouts/static- like after a hour/hour and a half of DJ'ing- it's REALLY weird, but really disruptive.

So, looking for a replacement. I've for a long time now eyed the DragonFly Reds(i hear Cobalt isn't as warm, so i feel like i should pass over that)- but, i understand the dragonfly lineup is a tad overpriced even though i don't mind getting another and the Black never had issues for me at all.

Any recs? I DJ using Mixxx ,mainly FLACS- I always hardwire in and don't use Bluetooth for DJ'ing at places.(Mentioning this because I see a lot of stuff on Qudelix and Bluetooth oddly)

I see people talk about Filo and Qudelix and the S9 Pro options- all seem solid, but I would like to hear from reddit. Don't want another hardware DAC situation situation where it oddly craps out suddenly a hour into DJing and has me apologizing to the floor

510,Mods: add DJ ID flare?,5,DJs,11,"Question to the people with the attention of the mods. One thing I‚Äôve notice as I‚Äôve been on this forum is that there are many types of dj here. This gives us a great range of perspective but it also causes some tension and conflicting advice. For example when asking about reading a crowd, one will advise to check your ego and play what makes the crowd happy, while the next will say fuck the crowd play what you feel. Or on the recent festival post some people advised to preplan your set while I find that blasphemous. A lot of these opinions depend on what kind of dj you are. If you‚Äôre a wedding/open format dj maybe it makes sense to go with the crowd, if your playing a mainstream festival, maybe a preplaned set is better, while for underground djs it makes more sense to showcase your abilities as a selector and play a set that‚Äôs spontaneous.

I think it would be helpful to know what type of dj is asking questions and what type of dj is giving advice. In the sports sub reddits, there‚Äôs a flare next to your username for team/player affiliation. I think it would be useful for us to identify our background so our perspectives are contextualized. Maybe some tags could be by genre/style ‚ÄúHouse‚Äù, ‚ÄúOpen Format‚Äù, ‚ÄúHip Hop‚Äù, or by event type ‚Äúwedding‚Äù, ‚Äúunderground club‚Äù, ‚Äúbedroom dj‚Äù, etc

520,Advice for playing at a music festival for the first time?,5,DJs,11,"I'm going to be playing at smaller music festival (around 3000 people) in my home country and it'll be my first time playing on a big stage separated from the crowd.

All the club shows I've done, I've been on a slightly elevated platform but close enough to lock eyes with individuals and high five people.  I feed off the energy from people's reactions and it informs my set, allowing me to build highs and lows and get in tune with what's working and what isn't.

**What advice do you have on playing to a crowd on a stage that big?**  

I'll be going on at 9:15 to 10:30, the festival ends at 2AM.  I have the perfect time slot to build the crowd up and get them pumped for the last 3 artists.  I don't want to plan my set before hand too much because I'm not a headliner so I can't trust that everything I want to do will work. 

Right now the gameplan is assume the majority of the crowd is still coming in, use the first 15 minutes to play popular songs / edits that invite people to the dance floor, ramp up to 3 or 4 different bangers, then taper off for the last 10 minutes to cool the crowd done for the next artist."

I would like to check with you if moving to a Xone 92 would make a big difference in sound quality/mix pleasure?

Or would perhaps adding some modern external phono preamps (genre ART DJ Pre II) to the Empath even get me a better sound VS the Xone?

I only need two channels though. The Xone's 4 band EQ looks to be a nice improvement to sculpt the mixing more, together with the filters and LFO.

Maybe there are other mixers to consider.
Had couple of years ago a Super Stereo DN78 rotary, but found it impractical, no panning, radio interference, imprecise, muddy. I like long mixes, but also fast cutting. So a rotary doesn't look to suit me well.

Please leave me your ideas, so I can move on in my mixing/sound journey. Thanks üôè

Or... who learned on vinyl?",16,DJs,61,"I wrote this as a reply to that other post about Denon DJ now having a shot at becoming ""industry standard"". I don't know why but the post was deleted. Anyway, I'd love to hear what other DJs think of my take, especially those who've come up through the change to digital.

TL;DR - The main reason Pioneer DJ became the industry standard in the first place is because the old standard bearer (Technics) didn't offer what the changing industry wanted. Pioneer will remain in place (regardless of the brand name) until they no longer provide what the industry needs, even if competitors manage to beat them around the margins of price and features.

Original comment: 

Here's my take looking back.

I  think about the last time the ""industry standard"" changed: from  Technics 1200s to CDJs. Pioneer DJ rose during a crucial transformation  in the industry, and their product did something that the incumbent club  standard *could not do*. 1200s  can not play digital music files. CDJs didn't just do what the previous  king did, but better, or at a lower price point. They did something the  previous standard couldn't do\*

So, I wonder, and I suspect, that Pioneer DJ / Alpha Theta / Whatever will only fall off if and when they can *no longer perform the essential function* of the brand leader, which is only this: provide gear that does what the industry wants

\*I realize DVS muddies this argument to some degree, but: I'll maintain  that what Pioneer brought to the table with their players was better  suited to industry needs as the digital revolution marched on. IIRC,  Phase was only launched in 2018, so until then DVS required not only a  laptop, but needles, for chrissakes. Meanwhile the CDJ2000NXS2 was  already out. DJs wanted digital, and the difference between a NXS2 and a  1200 with control vinyl presents a stark contrast between solutions to  that problem. Much more stark than a CDJ3000, and another product that's  marginally cheaper and marginally better. Know what I'm saying?

It was more of a visual association with the music and the sleeve.

In this CDJ/MP3 day and age how do you even start to form some sort of fimiliarity with your tracks? I'm sure DJ's have hundreds or thousands more tracks now then if they were Djing when it was predominently vinyl, yea some MP3s have little thumbnail fake sleeve images, but looking on a CDJ or laptop it's just text?, I understand you can have folders, but it's all essentially just lists to go through.

I find it easy to flick through a physical collection and think ""oh yea I try that one"", but I just don't have an association with the music by looking at track titles on a screen, even if I know the artists or title of the tune i'm looking for, anyone else have a similair problem?

Also how many tracks get lost into the ether this way, at least with physical media you have it there infront of you and it can jog a memory while flicking through, not squirreled away on hard drives or lists, never to be played again because hundreds of other tracks have superceeded it? so how do people keep a tabs on what they have, by memorising the artists & track names only?

Am I fucked? Do I really have to make an IG account after a decade of abstinence? Would a simple website be an alternative or is that super weird?

610,Mixer choice...I keep going back and forth!,3,DJs,37,"Hey, I'm struggling with a new mixer choice, I'm after some help from you lot, mainly in terms of what you have experienced and what is important to you.



Background - I'm in the UK. I have my trusty 1200's which are nearly 30 years old, 2 x XDJ1000mk2's, a CDJ1000mk3, Circuit Tracks, EFX-500.

* In the mid 90's: Just 2 channel Synergy crap mixer
* Late 90's DJM-300
* This decade: DJM-450
* Then a DJM750mk2
* Dabbled with an Ecler WARM2

The 1st WARM2 didn't play nicely with my Korg mini effects unit, the 2nd WARM2 popped and broke, as such I have no faith in another one.

The 750mk2 is capable, but it doesn't sound amazing. Also the effects are.....well, junk. I like the echo, and that's probably the only thing I use in earnest. The colour FX sound terrrible to my ears....ok, noise is fun to play with when you cut it in and out, but that's it. Dub echo and the filter are unusable.



So, I have a fair amount of kit, but don't always use it all together. I like rotary, that would mean Mastersounds Radius 2 / 4 given I'm in the UK, potentially an Ecler WARM4. I like the idea of the Xone PX5 as want that analogue sound, the effects all sound very similar, but hey...I like an echo!

The DJM A9 is a no. The V10 - dunno. Xone 92 is a hard pass as is the 96.

So, what else am I missing?



Is it really down to:

1. Radius 2 / 4
2. Xone PX5
3. WARM 4



Thanks all!"

619,Unpopular opinion: DJs who don't share tracklist have no respect for the producers,237,DJs,262,"I see lot of DJs neither sharing tracklist nor answering to track ID requests resulting in zero visibility for the producers.

I think it's such a selfish act, without producers there won't be any DJing.

I got it, you spent lot of time digging that gem, and when it comes to an old forgotten record, why not, but most of the time it's recent stuff and for big DJs with mostly tracks directly sent to them, so why not showcasing the ones making what you do possible?

I think that DJing is about sharing what you love, so share it?"

I notice they have song ID's for every track in the scroll bar. I know this question has been asked many times, but i'm seeing more youtube dj mixes like the ones above from Book Club Radio.

649,Landing gigs feels impossible to me. (Ive tried it all),44,DJs,100,"Some back info
i have been djing since i was 9 years old currently i am 20. I primarily play hardcore and techno which are the most popular genres where im from. I have been also been producing those genres for about 6 years. The producing is going really well, i have about 60 releases 7k avg monthly listeners on spotify and if you add all the numbers up around 2m streams. 650 followers on insta and thats about it. 

What i‚Äôve tried so far:

Networking 
Ive been networking for years but im not all that great with people it seems, I‚Äôve just been talking to people or at least trying to. I‚Äôve been going to mostly smaller parties in my area seeming with bigger parties its impossible to even get close to djs. I do get to play at some house parties every 3 months, but this isnt really getting me anywhere seeming usually theres about 20-50 people there.

Emails, emails upon emails.
Long emails, short emails, casual emails, business emails, mass emails, personal emails etc etc etc

Talent gigs and competitions 
I landed quite a few of these over the years and won a few prizes, but it all ended the same met new people but nothing happened

Radio gigs/livestreams
Played about a dozen of these, really fun to do but so far no luck at landing actual gig

I can go on with things ive tried, but i think you get the point. The reason i put it here in the first place is to avoid having to type that 20 times trying to explain it to people in the comments. Ive put my entire life on music, studies etc but its getting so depressing the last months.

Anyways i would really love to hear your suggestions!"

A foolishly bought an old Numark NS6 off eBay before really doing my home work and now I‚Äôm very aware it‚Äôs a dead dinosaur. I even bought a 2011 MacBook Pro with 10.13 software and a legacy version of Seratos ITCH (v2.2.2 I think) to see if I could resurrect it from the techno grave bit so far no luck .

As a result, I got super good and have moved from doing occasional parties to gigging on a weekly basis.

I bought an S9 last week tho after coming into some will money and have been LOVING it and decided i wanna bring it to my 2 gigs this weekend. That being said, I'm nervous about tech failing or something else going wrong.

664,Share your stuff - mixes/tunes/routines/videos (no livestream promotion),9,DJs,62,
665,So last gig was quite a challenge...,70,DJs,41,"Last week i had a voluntary 4 hour gig for our group of about 100 people during a holiday trip. I would bring my laptop with rekordbox and my music, some speakers and simple lights, and a friend would bring a DDJ-800, so we could have a party with the whole group.

Normally i always prefer to use my own gear, but i have an Opus and a FLX4; the opus is way to big to bring on a holiday and the FLX4 is a bit basic, so the DDJ-800 would be a great step up from the FLX4.

At the evening of the party, we are setting up the speakers, lights and eventually the DJ setup. However, at that moment we found out that the power adapter of the DDJ-800 isn‚Äôt working anymore! At that moment we tried to find a computer shop for a replacement power supply and drove over, but unfortunately it was hard to find a universal power supply with the right connector.. Even when we found one with the right connector, it didn‚Äôt connect that well, and didn‚Äôt provide a steady connection. (a small bump against the cable or connector resets the controller)

At that point we had a few options:

* Cancel the party
* Playing music through spotify
* Try to play/mix music in rekordbox with keyboard and mouse

This is where i was getting quite frustrated, i was really looking forward to this party, had some great tunes prepped and was ready to raise the roof!

Cancelling wasn‚Äôt really a option, the group was expecting a party and looking forward to it.

So I decided to do the party with rekordbox without a controller‚Ä¶

I almost never play through rekordbox (i prefer standalones), so that would be quite a challenge.

In the small time I got left, I looked up the hotkeys for cue/play, so I could start a track with the keyboard and then mix with the crossfader using the mouse. No EQ‚Äôing possible, but i‚Äôve got to play the cards I got dealt‚Ä¶

Then I even found out it wasn‚Äôt even possible to prelisten to tracks. Even though i had rekordbox hooked up to an external mixer with USB, i was expecting to be able to use the internal soundcard for prelistening.

When the party started, I needed a few tracks to get the hang of using the mouse and keyboard for mixing, but i got there.

It was an all-round party, so luckily i didn‚Äôt need to beatmix every transition. I used beat sync for the beatmatched transitions and kept them short because i couldn‚Äôt use EQ.

I know my music quite good, so i could pick tracks without prelistening, and used the waveforms to ‚Äòread‚Äô the tracks and decide on starting cuepoints. (for some tracks they were already set)

In the end we had a great party! Maybe not the best transitions, but the whole group enjoyed the tracks and had a great evening! I never want to mix with keyboard and mouse again, but i‚Äôm very happy it worked out quite fine.

This party just confirms again that mixing skills and gear are really not the most important, it‚Äôs all about track selection and track knowledge.

Could the party be better with the controller? Yes, probably! (and a lot easier!) Would the crowd notice? I don‚Äôt think so, most of the group didn‚Äôt even notice I was playing just from my laptop.

TL/DR: Had issues with the controller when setting up the gig, played the gig with mouse and keyboard without being able to prelisten. Still blew the roof off! It‚Äôs all about the tracks ;)"
669,Going to Networking events as a DJ,13,DJs,22,"Have anyone found general Networking events a waste of time for a DJ? Or In some cases for entrepreneurs overall.

673,USB-C Durability: A possible solution?,6,DJs,39,"Call me paranoid but I think the USB-C ports on newer DJ gear are going to potentially be a point of failure. This is mobile-spec port which is *relatively* durable but is still not as durable as the old USB Type B connector. My solution to this is [these](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0B8X6H96S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

My idea is this: get these adapaters, plug them into the USB-C ports on the decks and leave them connected. Plug my USB-C cable into the adapter rather than the port of the deck. This will save wear on the port. If the adapter starts to wear down, no biggie, i can replace the adapter and i'll be good to go for another x-y years. This potentially avoids the need for sending off the decks for USB-C repair, or dealing with awkward intermittent connection issues.

I'd be interested to know your thoughts anyways, cheers all.

Edit: jporter313 told me this exists which is pretty cool and I didn't know about: https://www.coolgear.com/product/usb-single-screw-lock-type-c-to-c-male-cable-10gb-data-3a-power

678,Algorithmic curation is killing music culture,99,DJs,80,"At least according to this editorial in RA. 

Two things:

1. Kyle Chaka is an OG tech journalist and is worth reading
2. A few key quotes below:

> In his new book, The New Yorker staff writer Kyle Chayka outlines why he thinks algorithms are ruining a person's ability to develop unique taste. Mathematically determined recommendations on social media, streaming and other platforms are deciding what music, food, art and entertainment becomes popular, he explains. The algorithm promotes the widest possible average, ""informing the songs we listen to, the friends with whom we stay in touch,"" he writes, warning that culture is getting homogenised as a result.

Also from another quote:

> Monoculture is stronger than ever, he noted, pointing to how people across the world are consuming the same narratives and aesthetics being pushed across mainstream media. 

>""That's not where I listen to music or look for music‚ÄìI go to gigs, I listen to radio and I talk to my friends,"" he said. ""Subculture is just nowhere near the stuff we're being shown.""

That last paragraph is gold. 

Moral of the story; don‚Äôt equate streams with success (or even quality). And don‚Äôt get your music from top 100 playlists."

686,Techno in Hamburg and how to get involved as a raver and DJ,6,DJs,3,"Hi!

I recently arrived in Hamburg since I'll be doing my master's degree for the next two years. I would like to know if there are WhatsApp or Telegram groups related to Techno culture or events in general. Also, groups of Latino people who are interested in Techno would be helpful. 

Moreover, being a DJ from Colombia, mainly focused on hypnotic Techno and Hardgroove, I would like to receive advice on how to get more involved in the scene, to get chances to play in clubs and events possibly. I just find kinda weird and difficult to talk to people at parties because most people want to listen to the music and enjoy the party. Also, I don't speak fluent German, which makes it even harder to talk to people. 

In conclusion, I would appreciate it if you guys know any clubs, collectives, or radios that would be willing to accept new DJs to play. Also, I accept any advice to make connections with other DJs. 

Thank you for reading and for the help!"

691,The lesson I learned this weekend,125,DJs,31,"I played at a festival over the weekend. I had two sets, one directly after the opening ceremony on the main stage in the evening, the other was Sunday mid afternoon. 

First set was fine. Totally happy with it and the crowd vibed and danced to what I played. 

For the Sunday set, I knew I needed to bring something different, but for it still to be ‚Äòmy‚Äô sound. So, as a hip hop/funk/breaks DJ and it being the last day of a three day festival, I complied a laid back collection of slower beats with nice bass lines, that a crowd could sway along to.

The DJs before played Afro house, ecstatic dance and ended with techno. The crowd were really up for it and dancing along furiously. This is when I second guessed my decision and instead of starting my set as I had planned, I dropped some breaks to keep the crowd dancing at the pace that had been set. It kinda worked, but the novelty of raving in the afternoon wore off, so I reverted back to my original plan and slowed it right down to 80-90-100bpm beats and it worked. The crowd swelled in numbers, the head nodding and swaying I had imagined beforehand was happening, and the Sunday summery vibe was set. I just wish that I had trusted myself and not tried to follow on from something that someone else had built.

The lesson I learned? Play what you know will set a vibe. It‚Äôs better to play from your heart, than to try and match someone else."

Is it me in general where the problem goes on or the people in general that i cannot upgrade my career? I do love playing,i love people and never did this for money at all even tho it‚Äôs a job for me. 

Side details ‚Ä¶if useful,i am resident now in 2 locations and 2 parties around the area i‚Äôm living in.

725,Do you guys create fresh sets constantly for gigs?,37,DJs,73,"I‚Äôve been a bedroom DJ for 1.5 years trying to get my foot in the door to actually play a gig (which is a wholeeeeeeeeeee nother issue). 
I was wondering when you get out into a venue and you‚Äôve got bookings relatively close to eachother by date, do you play the majority of the same the same songs, Or do you only play some of the same ones you know will get the crowd jumping. Or what is your guyses workaround to keep a fresh set, especially since many people could have heard your last set a week ago‚Ä¶

A big part of being a great DJ is obviously knowing your library in and out but how could you switch up your sets yet still have a full ‚Äúin and out‚Äù understanding of your library in such little time?

EDIT: when I say set I don‚Äôt mean a prepared set, i meant a gig. "

A month later, the vendor emails me about these form. Not sure what this W-9 and New Vendor request form is about since I'm amateur about this."
735,Saddest gig you've had?,88,DJs,146,"Before the pandemic hit, I would occasionally DJ at this club out of town. The club was new and the town was small. On average, maybe 10-20 people a night. It was bad. Management had no idea what they were doing and their marketing attempts were nonexistent. It didn't help that the other clubs were much more established and had a pretty good monopoly on the area.

Around Christmas time, there's an annual pub crawl called 12 Barz. Each city has their own set of venues and lucky for us, our club was selected as one of the stops. Management decided that this would be a great opportunity to hire an artist to perform and brought in JRDN. Throughout this period, they marketed the event nonstop and made a new JRDN post every day.

Fast forward to the night of the pub crawl, I arrived and had music on for 10. Around 11, the group arrives and the club is fully packed. Everyone's having a great time singing and by 11:15, it was empty again. I don't think the owner realized that they would just be coming by briefly because he looked shocked. JRDN arrived with his crew around midnight and we ended up talking for the rest of the night. He didn't end up performing and no one else showed up afterwards.

This was by far one of the saddest gigs I've ever had. The next saddest gig I had was for a birthday party where the guy rented out a big ass venue and only 10-20 people showed up. In terms of sheer scale, this one was definitely worse. The owner just looked so defeated afterwards that I don't think he ever recovered from that night.

Anyone else have any similar experiences?

Edit: Dumpster fires are appreciated too! My buddy had a beer tossed at him by some redneck uncle and had some guy ram his finger up his ass when his assistant went to pee lol."
742,How often do you check on the crowd and interact with them?,57,DJs,71,"I attended a couple of gigs from beginner DJs and i notice that during their whole set they dont look at the crowd at all, they are burried in their cdj or controller. Whereas, when i attended gigs from more experienced djs i notice that they quite often look at the criwd to check if we are vibing to the songs, sometimes even communicate with the crowd thorugh gestures etc.

Then recently, i was talking to a friend i met on one of the events, and he was speaking of how important to him it is that the dj is ""communicating"" with the crowd, not only with the songs but also with looking, smiling, interacting .

What is your take on this part? Do you check on your crowd during your set and how? If not, why not? If you have any interesting stories on this topic, do share!"
746,How are you keeping up with the sheer amount of music today and staying ahead of the curve of what's hot?,47,DJs,64,"I'm an old head and haven't spun a club gig in over 10 years. I was mainly a hip hop/open format DJ. I was just talking to an old DJ friend and he told me he quit 2 years ago because he simply couldn't keep up with the sheer amount of music and requests for unofficial youtube/remixes/tiktok songs. 

When I was DJing, Billboard top 40-100 was the backbone of my entire night set. Whatever was at the top of Billboard was my peak bangers that would for sure get the dancefloor filled. So as long as I had all the top billboard songs, I'd be mostly fine for the night.  I'd have a crate my old school classics that didn't really change. 

Then I'd have niche crates for subgenres that were hot at the time like an EDM crate, a dancehall reggae crate, a bmore club crate. To keep up with those it took being in the club bar scene and just seeing how crowds react to these rarer tracks that you don't hear on the radio. It also took a bunch of scouring forums, record pools, and record shops to get my hands on these rarer tracks.

Now billboard is far less relevant. There's not really a singular chart, top 20, or MTV/BET/Radio countdown that you can follow to know what's popular. TikTok and social media dictates alot of what music is popular. Sometimes old songs all of a sudden become popular like Fleetwood Mac Dreams blew up because of that guy skateboarding drinking cranberry juice. There are so many avenues to discover music that it's overwhelming. How are DJ's today keeping up with all of it?"
747,[How-to] What to do when your SoundSwitch autoscripts are suddenly empty after syncing your (Denon) Engine DJ library,6,DJs,2,"I recently had a bit of a nail-biting experience where I spent a long time autoscripting 100+ tracks on SoundSwitch for use with Engine Lighting on my Prime 4, only for the contents of the scripts I made to completely disappear. I thought I had lost a few dozen hours of work, only a couple days before my next gig. I couldn't find any definitive (working) answers on other forums, and support is rather slow given they're on the other side of the globe from me. I figured I'd share the dumb mistake I made and how I fixed it so that someone else may benefit down the road.

\---

**Here are the symptoms relevant to the situation:**

1) You have gone and autoscripted some tracks for use with SoundSwitch.

2) After syncing your library with Engine DJ, your autoscripted songs now show up blank, as if they've never been analyzed or scripted.

3) The ""SS"" logo may still appear in SoundSwitch next to the songs you previously scripted.

4) Clicking ""Rebuild TrackMap"" does not fix anything, and if #3 was true, the ""SS"" logo is now gone as well.

5) When you look in the directory for your SoundSwitch project, you still see plenty of .ssfile and .ssa files.

\---

**Here is what happened in my situation:**

I had foolishly been creating autoscripts \*directly on my Prime 4's internal SSD\*, not on my computer. What this means is that rather than accessing my music library on my computer, which I then sync to my Prime 4's drive, I accessed my music directly on my Prime 4 from SoundSwitch.

*Why this is a problem*

The way SoundSwitch identifies tracks is by inserting a custom metadata tag on each song you create an autoscript for. As far as I can tell, Engine DJ does not sync track metadata back to the library on your computer. Therefore, even if Engine DJ says ""new data to sync"" from your controller back to your computer, it's not going to copy over the custom metadata SoundSwitch inserted when you created a script.

However, when you sync from your computer over to your controller, Engine DJ \*will overwrite\* the metadata for your library, including the songs you created autoscripts for. Since the tracks on your local library don't have the custom SoundSwitch metadata tag, that tag gets erased on your controller during sync. At this point, due to the TrackMap, SoundSwitch will likely still show an ""SS"" logo next to the tracks you created scripts for, but clicking on those tracks will show you a totally empty file as if you haven't done any work. Clicking ""Rebuild TrackMap"" will ruin things further because SoundSwitch will examine your music library, search for its custom metadata tag in each song, find none, and then wipe out all ""SS"" logos because it did not find any music file with the tag indicating it has a script.

\---

**How I fixed it:**

Based on what I've already described, you may have an idea of where this is going. After figuring out how SoundSwitch works with music files, here is what got me back on my feet:

1) Open your song or library directory with a music tag editor such as [MP3Tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/).

2) Click on the track you want to re-attach an automation to and press Alt+T.

3) Click to add a new tag with the name SOUNDSWITCH\_ID. The data field should contain the \*precise\* name of the .ssfile (found in your SoundSwitch project directory) which corresponds to that particular track. For example, if I know that the file {D65B6572-A50F-4C5F-AD6E-8FE1E6546102}.ssfile corresponds with the track in my library called ""I'm Good"", I'd open up ""I'm Good"" in MP3Tag, click it, press Alt+T, add a new field with the name SOUNDSWITCH\_ID and the data {D65B6572-A50F-4C5F-AD6E-8FE1E6546102}.

4) Repeat this for every. single. track. Tedious? Absolutely. Better than losing dozens of hours of work? Also absolutely.

*However, this begs the question... how in the world do you correlate .ssfile names with their respective tracks?*

This is where things get really tricky, and where I honestly got really lucky. I had created a playlist for my gig, and had gone down the list from top-to-bottom creating a script for each track. Therefore, I was able to sort my SoundSwitch project directory by ""Created At"", start with the earliest-created .ssfile, know that correlated with the first track in my playlist, and then move down from there. 

If you created scripts at random, things are going to be much, much harder for you, and you may spend more time trying to match up tracks to .ssfiles than you would just completely re-doing the scripts altogether. Do note, however, that correlating the wrong .ssfile to the wrong track doesn't hurt anything as long as you don't save. You can open it up and it will be very obvious that things don't match up. Looking at the script itself may also help you to know which track it actually belongs to!

\---

**After all was said and done...**

It took me a couple hours to correlate metadata tags to the 100+ tracks. This time, of course, I made sure to create the scripts while navigated to the library on my \*computer\*, NOT on my Prime 4. Things looked good, I synced using Engine DJ from my computer to my Prime 4, and everything finally, finally worked.

Hopefully this helps someone at some point, or even better, helps someone to avoid making the same dumb mistake I did. Needless to say, I've been thoroughly enjoying SoundSwitch / Engine Lighting despite some quirks and needed improvements, and look forward to what they do in the future."
751,Guidance needed from vets: hi end corp. client acquisition in NYC for mobile gigs / how to get paid more,3,DJs,25,"So, this appears to be borderline a r/beatmatch post, but hear me out, it‚Äôs more nuanced.

Hey. I‚Äôm Roman. I live in New York City, and I‚Äôve been a high level nightclub DJ for about five years here. Played in just about every club in NY. people tell me I‚Äôm one of the best. I don‚Äôt have a big head about it, but I know I do pretty well, and I‚Äôm looking for further opportunities to grow, progress, and make money.  I‚Äôm feeling stagnant after running laps around the circuit and not getting any further ahead financially. (I‚Äôm a full time DJ). I want to devote more of my time to music production, but am in a weird place.

I‚Äôm well aware that the real money is in corporate events, traveling and private events, though I have a great website and great visibility in the city, I feel like I don‚Äôt have the contacts for this type of work.

I do advertise myself as the cool club DJ on my site -Romanchappelle.com, because I didn‚Äôt want to be seen as a birthday party DJ or cheap mobile DJ.  I wanted to be seen as underground and club cool, and am ultimately an artist. it worked out, I built my brand well, and I‚Äôm trusted at what I do at many high-end clubs and hotels as well as the underground.

Now I still want to be cool. I produce music, and I travel, playing in aspen next week- but I‚Äôm also aware that I feel I‚Äôm leaving money on the table by not pursuing more of the right mobile gigs. I have got a few inbounds on my website for events, but not nearly as many as I‚Äôve got talking to people.

I have some equipment I would like to do more high end corp/brand gigs, consistently.  Nike, fashion, Google parties etc. 



I‚Äôve signed up for bark and thumbtack, but I don‚Äôt want to do 16 year old birthday parties for 300 bucks. That‚Äôs not worth the money I spend on gear and transportation. I can also make that during a club night not bringing any gear, usually more.



I‚Äôm looking to work with higher end clients- $1500 and up. Do you all have any experience with PR companies, and larger event producers? Goals are gigs for fashion week, large corporate events, and industry conferences. As a New Yorker I know these things happen every single day and have done work for Tissot, IMG, soho house, etc. The frustrating part is that I am in touch with agents annd agencies, the gigs are just so infrequent that they‚Äôre almost 1 a quarter. 

I haven‚Äôt broken in consistently yet.

Being vulnerable here, as a full-time nightclub DJ, I sometimes feel like I am struggling to survive financially, even while I am doing the flashiest gigs, and playing the best clubs in the city, and do make $300 an hour more than occasionally.

At this point I‚Äôm well aware that my mathematics are in need of more consistent high end clients, and nightclubs just don‚Äôt pay the bills. Do I need to be signed to an agency? Should I start my own? Maybe it‚Äôs a marketing issue- and if you look at my Instagram, I have removed a lot of my nightclub work because I‚Äôm starting to replace it with artist cntent, my own music, and better branding, because I no longer just want to be seen as a nightclub guy.

I‚Äôve already received the basic guidance of check out agencies, network more, etc.  looking to ask for some experienced perspectives. I don‚Äôt want to leave any more money on the table. I eventually plan to be able to sell tickets at more major venues, and be more of an artist doing big numbers, but getting there, I have to pay the bills.

  
I am also a copywriter on the side, so I know how to do a bit of marketing. Looking for any smart guidance, preferably from people who‚Äôve done it before. "
762,DJs who don't party,5,DJs,201,"I was inviting people to my party from a Facebook group. As it turned out, some of the group members were DJs and as I sent them my invitation, they replied that: ""Thank you, but I don't go to parties unless it's work and I am getting paid"". It was not a one time incident, and I saw a pattern emerging.

Well...
In my opinion it's quite sad when someone only go parties when he has to. Just imagine a porn-star who is at home with their partner: ""Sorry, I only have sex if I am working and getting paid"". Or a photographer who only opens his eyes to see the world when he works, otherwise he is wearing a blindfold.

Talking to these DJs was an instant turn off for me. I would not invite them to play at the events I organise if they have this burnt out attitude.

I am a DJ, and when I don't have a gig, then I am often going to parties or festivals where I even pay entrance, instead of getting paid. Am I the minority here?"
764,Day before gig have been told I am now going b2b with another DJ who has a different genre style. Tips?,8,DJs,30,"For context, I am a beginner DJ and producer who plays a lot of upbeat house music. Mainly tech house and deep tech/underground stuff. Things that don‚Äôt have many vocals but a lot of groove and nice bass lines.

Been booked in for this gig for over a month however 1 day ago the organisers told me a new DJ will be starting and therefore has told me I‚Äôll be having a b2b set.

The guy I‚Äôll be going back to back with is a friend of mine, but his genre is super melodic, happy, slow house tunes that you‚Äôd expect at a Martin Garrix show. Not ideal. 

I told them to change it but they say nothing can really be done. I had the closing slot (2nd best slot) and prepared a great hour long set with my music. However now being told I‚Äôll be going b2b with him, I‚Äôm worried about how the energy flow will go. Obviously I can‚Äôt play 3 deep tech house bangers for him to turn to 3 festival like David Guetta tracks. It‚Äôll just sound awkward. 

I told him to dig out some beats, and that he can use some from my USB, but I‚Äôm just annoyed really that the full 1 hour has been taken from me. I guess things like this happen, but as a semi-beginner DJ I really wanted the full slot to showcase my skills. I don‚Äôt want people in the crowd discrediting the set because the flow of the music is weird.

This is my wedding and I don‚Äôt care! Make it ratchet!‚Äù So of course I obliged and played the requested rap songs. I like all of that stuff but felt it was too explicit in that situation.

781,How to deal with burnout when taking a break is not an option?,10,DJs,21,"Every once in a while, we all get burnt out and need to take a break. But I'm in a situation where I'm studying during the week days and playing pretty much every Friday and Saturday in the weekends.

I have a feeling that I'm kinda burnt out at the moment. I don't get excited to play, I barely spend any time on finding new music above the bare minimum, my energy during gigs is through the floor, usual burnout stuff you know. I really want to take a break and don't even drink, network nor go to afters anymore.

The thing is, my gigs pay my rent and put food on my table, so taking a break isn't really an option for me in the next couple of months, because the job market here kinda sucks. When I get a chance, I'm definitely taking a break. Until then, is there something I can do to reignite my previous excitement and motivation to play? Try to focus on something or any advice for this? Because I feel my performance is taking a hit and I don't like that.

I know I'm incredibly lucky to be in my position and I'm in no way ungrateful or anything, but burnout kinda sucks

3)Sold off my old club gear, when I fell out of DJing years ago. So all I have is my flx4. I don‚Äôt mind buying/renting a mixer and gear. But technically I would be losing money based off the pay"
793,First DJ gig went absolutely terrible! I need your advice!,11,DJs,228,"So, a bit of context. I‚Äôve been a bedroom DJ for almost two years now and I consider my DJing abilities to be quite good as of now as I practically master stuff like beatmatching, transitions, etc. I also have a music library that‚Äôs quite large (I ONLY play EDM, so mostly House, Trance, Techno, etc.). Up to this point I‚Äôve only played for myself in my own bedroom as a hobby (always having a blast), and a few times on very small gatherings with friends (not so much to play entire sets for them, but mostly to show them my controller and my music), but I consider my abilities and music library to be good enough to play at a club or festival anytime without any issues, or so I thought until last night. 

The whole thing was a shitshow, let me explain. So yesterday was my friend‚Äôs birthday and she decided to throw a party at her lake house. She asked me if I could bring my stuff and play a set at her party, and I accepted (for free). I‚Äôll admit that I didn‚Äôt prepare at all as I hadn‚Äôt practiced for days, hadn‚Äôt sorted my new songs, hadn‚Äôt even analyzed them on Rekordbox or set up hot cues (which I always do), etc. I was aware of all of this but I didn‚Äôt give it much importance as I had come up with killer sets on the fly in the past even with songs I had only listened to once, and people at raves are usually too drunk/high to even notice small mistakes. 

But there lies the problem, this was no rave, this was a house party. At most there were perhaps 12 to 15 people, AT MOST. Mostly distant ‚Äòfriends‚Äô and acquaintances, people who‚Äôve known me for years, and for most of them this was the first time they found out I‚Äôm a DJ. When I arrived the atmosphere was practically nonexistent, just a bunch of dudes and a few girls just sitting down, talking in small groups separated from each other or looking at their phones. I was even surprised and I thought I had arrived way too early, but turns out the party had already been going for like 3 hours. And the thing is, I know these people, and I know that they don‚Äôt listen to any EDM at all, so when I saw them while coming in I felt worried, but I didn‚Äôt make too much of it and said hi to everyone and had a few drinks and a few laughs. 

A couple hours later my friend asked me if I could start DJing and I said sure, thinking I might be able to maybe cheer everyone up. While setting up I started to feel a bit nervous (normal, it was my first gig after all), and as I started to DJ the people approached and some of them started dancing a bit but literally after like 2 or 3 songs most of them just walked away, I wondered if perhaps I started too strong as I opened with some light trance, but perhaps that was too much for them and I should‚Äôve started with some generic house instead. Either way, I tried for a much funkier direction instead (nu disco, funky house) but none of them came back, there were only like 4 dudes left who weren‚Äôt even dancing, just staring at the visuals on the screen (I think they were high). And then there were this two drunk assholes who would constantly approach and start ""cheering for me"" but like in a derisive way while also mocking the way ravers dance and then they would leave laughing, or they would approach me and start playing with the jog wheel or twisting the knobs without my permission basically fucking up my beatmatch. 

I reached the breaking point when two dudes just straight up started harassing me. One of them would constantly approach me telling me that I had been playing ""techno"" (it was house, but whatever) for like 3 hours (it had been ONE hour tops) and demanding me to play Hip Hop instead. The other one would just stand by my side and start telling me that he ""wasn‚Äôt feeling it"" and that I should play better stuff, or he would just stare at the computer screen and ask ""how much longer?"" or say ""you‚Äôre taking too long"". Everyone looked so fucking bored and I felt so pressured because I felt that maybe they weren‚Äôt having a good time because of me, like maybe I was forcing my music down their throats or something. At this point there was basically no one sticking around so I just unplugged everything and left the fucking party. 

I was so fucking angry and I felt extremely humiliated and embarrassed, and the thing that enraged me the most is that the birthday girl and the other 3 people who were asking me ""when are you gonna start DJing?"" the entire party just walked away after like 10 fucking minutes, so why did I even bother? Especially the birthday girl, she made me feel like a dancing monkey, a circus freak, a novelty to show to all of her friends that she can just throw away when she gets bored of it. I then felt extremely sad because when I got home I opened the IG story of a friend who stayed at the party and it looked like everyone was having a blast. It was like as soon as I left the party, they were finally able to play their Hip Hop music and have fun. I have to say that not everything was all that bad, the few actual close friends of mine that were at that party were actually enjoying themselves and dancing and asking me with real curiosity stuff about DJing or the controller or the software. 

So my first gig was a nightmare, and I‚Äôm left wondering what should I do. One the one hand I LOVE DJing, it‚Äôs my favourite pastime and my way to decompress and relax after a long day. I‚Äôve also considered having it as an actual job because I‚Äôm a producer and I think it would be a nice way to promote my music, and also because I love raves and because you can travel a lot with this job. On the other hand, I‚Äôm seriously questioning my abilities because maybe I‚Äôm not as good as I thought I was and maybe this job is just not for me, and also the thought of dealing with this bullshit every time (drunk assholes, song requesters, dead crowds) is just appalling, I‚Äôve always known that these are a DJ‚Äôs worst enemies (almost cliche) but having finally interacted with these people and these situations in the flesh felt way worse that I thought it would tbh. Also, what worries me is that this is a small town and word could quickly spread that maybe I‚Äôm a shitty DJ which could impact my career prospects (I don‚Äôt even live here anymore anyways but who knows, what if word reaches the town I‚Äôm currently living in?). Ugh, I don‚Äôt know what to make of all of this.

I‚Äôm sorry for this long ass rant, but I felt that if I didn‚Äôt get all of that out my head would explode. So what do you think guys? What should I do? Maybe next time I should prepare better and stick to a theme? I think I‚Äôve learned my lesson to NEVER DJ at a house party ever again unless its packed and I‚Äôm sure the assistants enjoy EDM.

Edit: Just to clarify some things for some people in the comments, I acknowledge I fucked up by not preparing beforehand, that was my mistake and I learned the lesson. To be fair though, the host knew I exclusively play edm (for the moment) and she said it was alright, that the guests would like that music, and I took her word for it. Also one of the reasons this didn‚Äôt work out is because the party was supposed to have more than 100 guests, and I guess she was expecting it to be like Project X or something, of course it didn‚Äôt go as planned. I‚Äôm not saying the audience was wrong and dumb and I was right and smart, they were right to be bored, it‚Äôs just that I didn‚Äôt have a good time during my first live performance, that‚Äôs all.

808,Practicing on a setup I do not own ahead of a Gig this month - Question,11,DJs,42,"Hi everyone, I have a quick question: 

I landed a gig this month, and the venue has this setup: Pioneer DJM 900 Nxs 2 mixer & two CDJs 2000 nxs2. 

This is a fairly big upgrade from the current setup I own (Hercules DJcontrol Inpulse 200‚Ä¶)

I started watching YouTube video reviews about the setup I will be playing on, but I was wondering whether you can suggest me any more tips or suggestions about how I could get anywhere more comfortable for playing/learning on a setup I do not own. 

Thanks for anyone willing to spend some time on an answer!"

I like the advantage of iTunes to ID3 tag, preview, shuffle and enjoy music without having to open up DJ software - so my thought process was that it's easier to organize a substantial library in there. And then while I'm flowing around, construct a set in iTunes itself in a playlist - and then sync the playlist with the Rekordbox/iTunes sync.

Recently I've been thinking more and more about doing this the other way around - just using iTunes as an aggregate for ID3 tagging + music listening, but actual set preparation and organizing things for gigging in Rekordbox. Is there a difference? Does it really matter? Appreciate any opinions."

It's a Nostalgia FB page and thought I might celebrate the amount of followers by throwing a party. So I hired a boat weeks ago and now there's a few days left and I've sold maybe 40 out of the 150 tickets I was supposed to. They say most people would buy tickets at the last minute but I'm obviously worried so now I'm trying to figure out what I can do to get a last minute boost in tickets. I don't care about the money even, so long as I can just pull a decent crowd.

The whole with promoting is most of the people you'd bring are closely related to you or people you've already interacted with, but I'm still trying to figure out what I can do to convert people and if there's any way I can push tickets without that.

What I really want is that turning point where I start getting more notice as a DJ and my mean starts meaning more but that comes with time, getting a break or some kind of opportunity that takes me to the next level where followers start building up.

Still working on the exact mechanics, but the general idea would be to give the AI access to your music libraries and let it learn what you like to play (possibly even what you've played in past sets) in addition to several inputs (e.g. moods, location, etc.) and it would output graphics in the form of GIFs and short videos you can control with a small touch screen.

Throwaway account.

I think I need a bit of a reality check to see if i‚Äôm justified at being mad at my local clubs or if i‚Äôm being ridiculous.

For context:
Club A (biggest club in my city) i‚Äôve been speaking with since October. The manager there originally said they would get me on within two weeks, but they never open my messages on insta. Every time i go into the club to speak to the manager they act all friendly and just say it‚Äôs been busy but they‚Äôll get me a gig within the month. Obviously this hasn‚Äôt happened and I feel like i‚Äôm just being strung along.

Club B recently opened within the past few months. I‚Äôve been emailing them and they were pretty keen to get me in to play and i‚Äôve even played there once. They originally said my music was too fast for them (they were playing house and I played techno) and asked if i could change up the vibe. I agreed and sent them a house mix. They then stopped replying and i‚Äôve heard nothing even after multiple follow-ups. This week I see that they‚Äôre now playing techno which has annoyed me a little after asking me to change and then ghosting me.

Also, just for more context, i have a small following and DJ regularly at Club C (2nd biggest club in my city) usually as headlining/closing act might I add.

Would love someone else‚Äôs thoughts on this situation."
876,How to find the ACTUAL key,5,DJs,47,"I'm playing a lot of drum n bass lately, and getting great reactions from the people who see me perform.. but when I go back and listen I hear a lot of minor mistakes and I can tell that some of my song picks are out of key.

I thought that doing this somehow would always be correct, but often times I'll mix in what should complimentary keys and they audibly clash, no matter which method I use. Is there any reliable way to find the ACTUAL key for my tracks?

My father used to be a DJ in his 20s, and a few years ago he bought some old Pioneer CDJ 200s (I believe).

915,Midi mapping question - NS6ii,0,DJs,5,"Hi everyone. I've been using Traktor for 15 years and was gifted an NS6ii some time ago, and it has been collecting dust in a corner, as I'm not fond of Serato and don't intend to switch over. I recently pulled it out and started creating a map of all the basic features (cue, play, volume faders, etc.).

I wanted to move on to the more complex aspects involving Midi Out. After a lot of trial and error, I mapped the volume of Decks A and B to the appropriate VU meter (ch01.cc.031 and ch02.cc.031 respectively). When trying to map the Master Volume to the controller's LED, I discovered, when checking the drop-down list of midi out options, there are 16 channels, each has 127 ""sub-channels"" and about 30 additional ""notes"" that can be assigned to a function. Meaning there are thousands of needles in the haystack when searching for the right one!

My question is as follows: is there any way, any software, I could use to find each function of the midi controller in question beforehand so that I can know what to map to it, instead of the reverse? For example (as dumb and science-fiction-y as it may sound), something that triggers each possible midi channel for half a second so that it lights up and shows me what the right midi address is?

Alternatively, any simpler way to find out how to map a Traktor function (specifically the Master Volume L+R) to the appropriate LED?"

919,Any other DJs out there who don't really care about playing live anymore?,129,DJs,194,"Hi all! Quick bit of background before getting into the question. I started DJing in 1999 and quit in 2008. Most of my gigs during that time were at afterparties, fetish parties and the occasional club appearance.

After a 15 year break, I decided to start up again at the ripe old age of 50, because I love the music and missed being creative, but I'm happy with just posting my mixes on my Soundcloud page. I really don't care about playing live anymore as I would rather work on my DJ and production skills (which I also started a year ago), than trying to hustle and promote myself in order to get gigs in the small city I moved to in 2022. I also find that this has freed me from dancefloor centric music. I've been branching out into ambient, downtempo and electronica which I would imagine isn't super marketable , especially in my neck of Upstate NY.

Just wondering if there are any other DJs out there who don't care about performing in front of a crowd.

And even then, the sound still sometimes cuts out or lowers?  On my pair I feel like I'm always having to mess with the left cable as the left side cuts out frequently, not the right.

What do you do with those tracks that never make it to banger or iconic status? Do you keep them or toss them out?

Fillers do have a purpose. Many of them copy a sound that works and just rearrange the melodies etc. They allow us to split the bangers and hits up and time their release. Many fillers are solid tracks, they just dont stand out from the crowd or scream 'keep me'. "
923,Getting a Kontrol Z2 in 2024 - is it a good idea?,5,DJs,18,"Hi all. I have moved to a new country, and finally saved enough money to transport my 2x1200 and my vinyl collection here, but there is no mixer. In past I used Numark M6 USB and was happy with it. Now I need to get a mixer, and I while checking for what's available on 2nd hand market here, I found few decent priced Z2's in good condition. 

I understand that this model is discontinued, and is basically more than 10 years old.  But in terms of outputs (RCA for Master output + TRS for booth monitor) and the presence of audio interface (*I've always been a Traktor guy, so NI stuff is usually perfect for me*) it is exactly what I need. And the size, too - I don't need a 4 channel mixer, and I prefer my mixer to be not too big (the table I'm going to build will be rather small, just for 2 1200 and a mixer). 

My only concern is Z2 being an old model, and if it breaks down, I will hardly be able to repair it. And also I am not quite sure if the modern Traktor Pro 3 supports it well. Anyone here using Z2 in their setup? How does hold up until now? I can get a used Z2 for ‚Ç¨250. "

The problem is, no one taking DJing seriously would invest in this. This is not for clubs, promoters, or anyone in industry. And no one casually DJing would pay that much for a toy like this‚Ä¶ unless they had disposable income. Nobody asked for this. If they wanted the rebrand to be taken seriously, they should‚Äôve come out with a more serious product. 

You‚Äôre gonna see content creators doing short form videos playing Losing It at the Eiffel Tower or Badadan in a fucking bodega on this thing. 

And don‚Äôt get me started on the speaker -_-

Anyway feel free to join my hate train lol, or even offer up some counter opinions. I‚Äôm interested and concerned to see what happens to this brand."
932,Big tempo gaps on vinyl without effects (Funk/Soul/Disco),3,DJs,17,"Context: I started out playing hardgroove and hypnotic techno digitally and I've transitioned to playing on vinyl and digital combined lately. My tempo and beat matching has been getting pretty decent so I have no problems mixing techno.

Question: Now I was asked to play an 80s funk/soul/disco set with tracks mostly in the range from 100 to 130 BPM. While doing my selection and testing the tempo and beat matching I noticed that playing most of these at plus or minus 10 percent or even more (my Reloop RP-7000s can do 8, 16 or 50) just sounds shitty most of time, especially on vocals.

How would you go about doing transitions from say 105 to 125 or vice versa? I use a Xone:92 mixer without any external effects so echo out, etc are not an option for me. I've tried literally ignoring the tempo and doing a crossfader transition and bass swap at the right moment and that sounds decent but not great and I feel like there has to be more to it."

There‚Äôs this stigma, that the DJ has to play what I like to call ‚Äúsurface level‚Äù music. Meaning what‚Äôs popular and what makes people dance and safe to play. 

AND THEN there‚Äôs the music you curate to deemed very creative, funky, and eclectic selection of music. Everything is mixed in well, in key and maintaining a nice groove. But you damn well if you played this set people would be like WTF is this I‚Äôm leaving this place. 

The genre of music I‚Äôm referring to is of course house music. But this can me related in any genre of music.

Anyone ever think this?"

943,Help me out guys! TIA!!!,0,DJs,20,"TL:DR need a set of speakers to mix with outside. Not for a party just for me with the speakers sitting in front of the decks. What should I get.

I‚Äôve done a ton of research on this sub and many other pro audio sub reddits but I have not been able to find a good answer for the exact situation I‚Äôm in. I often mix outside just sitting at a table with the speaker sitting in front of me. I‚Äôm not trying to play any parties & no people will be around me. 

  Would a studio monitor work to produce a good sound to practice my mixing outside or should I look towards a powered PA and turn it way down. I‚Äôve heard that studio monitors sound off if they aren‚Äôt placed correctly. If someone could steer me in the right direction that would be much appreciated!"
944,Recording in Pro Tools (or any other DAW) with Serarto/Rekordbox?,1,DJs,9,"Can someone please help an old school head out. 

I am familiar with recording into pro tools with 1200's, a dj mixer, mixing board and a digi 002. 

I have no idea how to go about doing that with a dj controller and serato or rekordbox (have not made my mind up which one I am going to use). I see people using both in my field but I know clubs favor rekordbox. But, probably not going down the club road again so not concerned with that. 

I assume the dj controller connects via usb to my mac m2 studio and the audio outs go into whatever interface (suggestions appreciated) I decide to buy? 

How exactly do I get music from the DJ controller into Pro Tools, Logic or Ableton? Does serato some how route it to pro tools and both software's run at the same time? Is that a recipe for crashes or not in this day and age?

I think Ableton is more straight forward in regard to connecting from serato with a bridge from what I read. But, I still don't know how to do that.  I haven't read any solid info about pro tools or logic. I favor pro tools because I am more familiar with it, but I have all three. 

A few side questions - can the dj controller and/or interface be connected to a hub or do I have to tie up two usb 3 spots on my mac? Is there a limit on cable length?

I tried reading a bunch of info before posting this but I want to make sure before I buy the wrong controller and interface. I was thinking between rev 7 or flx 10. BUT I really only have room (right now) for the flx 4. However, I read the sound quality sucks so I'd rather not go down that road plus it has rca outs. 

Would a flx 4 sound worst than my old set up? or do cheap sound cards sound worst than vinyl and a good set up?

Thanks in advance, sorry for the noob post. I am a little behind the times and playing catch up lol"

959,Latency Issues w Controller + Audio Interface + Speakers,0,DJs,18,"I produce music and DJ but am having trouble with my hardware connection routes / topology. What is the most efficient way to do this?

My current system:
1) DJing (RekordBox, DDJ-FLX4) PC -> Controller -> XLR Cables -> Studio Monitors

2) Music Production: PC -> Scarlett Audio Interface -> TRS Cables - Studio Monitors

My Current Issues:
1) I can't have the TRS and XLR cables plugged into my studio monitors at the same time without getting a loud buzzing feedback during production.

2) I can't plug my controller into my Scarlett Audio Interface without getting latency issues while DJing

960,How to transcend a niche?,2,DJs,6,"I've been DJing themed club nights for a few years now with one events company. My most recent gig with them is centered around a very popular popstar and the parties do very well, and more have been popping up in my city with other promoters and I am being asked to DJ them.

I am very grateful for the opportunities but I'm growing tired of this celebrity's music and am capable of doing much more interesting things. I would like to move beyond this, but I'm feeling stuck on how. I worry that if I message another promoter about an idea, they can just run with the idea with their existing network. I do try to set myself apart by making my own remixes that I exclusively play out at my shows, and they go over very well. 

I also feel like I don't have a name for myself in the genres I am personally interested in and I don't know how to expand my network. While my work is quality and expansive, it feels like it's from a different world.

16,PSA to clean out your playlists/collection (also hit me with your organization tips!),11,DJs,5,"This is obviously basic info, but I've been doing some housekeeping in Rekordbox and it's so rewarding! I'd love to get some insights and tips on how you keep things organized!

I play (very) open format and have been building my Rekordbox collection since I started in 2017. In the early stages I had the approach that it's better to have too much music for my 4hr set, and still I kept running out of songs to fit the vibe. So the collection kept building.

Some of my playlists have been big umbrella lists like ""Everything Hiphop"" or ""Everything 80s"" playlists. These last few years though I've been avoiding browsing those 1000 song lists while playing because they're just overwhelming and fruitless. So instead I stick to my newer, more specific playlists, e.g. ""Lo-fi House"" or ""Latin Disco"".

I realized there were an astonishing number of tracks I've never even played since 2017, which can be either reasonable or unfortunate. So I've started going through all the songs with 0 plays (then 1, 2 etc.) in my playlists and removing a whole lot of meh songs from the collection which were really just added in fear of running out of music. Some get to stay but in some other playlist, some get updated with new tags etc.

It feels so inspiring knowing that there are a lot less filler tracks in there and that the songs are in the playlist they belong! It's a never-ending work of course, but it's so worth it.

What are your tips for housekeeping?"
18,Study: Shifts in song lyrics in the last 4 decades,92,DJs,46,"My fellow music nerds, listen up:

This recent study analyzed a sample of 12000 songs spanning 40 years. The findings confirmed an ongoing trend of lyrics becoming simpler and more repetitive.

What's new and somehow not surprising: They also found shifts in the lyrical content. Mood wise lyrics became less happy, more sinister. And the use of self relating words (I, me, myself, ...) has risen, hinting at a more self focussing attitude in society.

Feel free to discuss. Or to nod slowly, murmuring ""I *knew* it"" because that's what reading science is really about."

20,"DJ‚Äôs who chose to obscure your identity, how/why did you do it, how did it go for you, and would you recommend it?",32,DJs,83,"Been making music for a while but want to finally release and perform live. Being around the scene, I‚Äôve noticed an uncomfortable number of ‚Äòdj‚Äôs‚Äô that give 0 fucks about the craft and only care about the lifestyle and making sure their socials make them look as cool as possible. 

I know it‚Äôs a tale as old as time and will always be a part of the industry/culture, but, for those of us that just love music and the craft and don‚Äôt need substances to find joy in sharing music you love with others, how did you differentiate yourself? 

To me, hiding my identity makes it more believable that I‚Äôm in it for the music and I don‚Äôt need to worry about always maintaining appearances/looking cool for instagram. Also I feel like so much of the discourse around music revolves around identity politics these days which to me (queer POC) still feels backwards. Music is one of the most powerful tools of unity we have as a species - it‚Äôs a truly universal language! Yet it feels like we often use it as a means of exclusion and ego/status. 

It‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôve always admired most about daft punk (I know their faces are out there but to most people who were unfamiliar with their faces but loved their music, daft punk could have been anyone) and other similar artists, although in recent times, it‚Äôs turned into a bit of a gimmick. What are y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts on this? 

But also wearing a mask every time sounds like it would quickly become annoying as F U C K so maybe that trumps all the sentimental bs above lol"
