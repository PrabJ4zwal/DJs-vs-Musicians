1,I earned over $100k in 2023 as an independent solo musician playing restaurants,744,18x0qi5,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/18x0qi5/i_earned_over_100k_in_2023_as_an_independent_solo/,268,"My situation: 
I live in a pretty large city (Atlanta) and I gig 5+ times a week.  I have 2 regular residencies at hotel lobby bars on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  I always try for corporate gigs on Thurs/Fri/Sat but will play bars/restaurants if not available.  I’m also sometimes occupied with family stuff on these days.  I have a steady (paid) church gig every Sunday and also sometimes brunch gigs. 

With the guaranteed $$ from the hotels  and church + tips + additional bar gigs + the occasional high paying corporate gigs, I average close to $2k/week.  I was a school teacher for 20 years and quit 2 years ago to do music full time.  This is the first year that I have grossed over $100k.  This is of course pre-tax but I am very diligent about saving 20% so I’m ahead of the game for tax time.  I also own/manage a party band (my day job) and I earned an additional $35k from that.  So, I am ridiculously grateful to be making a comfortable living in the music business in my 40s.  

I’ve realized I’m pretty introverted (another reason to quit teaching) so I really enjoy the solo musician thing, and because I do a looping one-man-jam-band kind of thing, I can keep myself pretty entertained at a slow gig.  So, I don’t feel burnt out at all.  

I feel like if there is any advice to give, it would just be all the obvious things: show up on time, regularly practice and work on your craft, play/sing well, have reliable gear, tip bartenders, treat people with respect… kind of all the obvious facets of being a professional and treating music like any professional job.  

Writing this post just to point out that this is a very realistic scenario and I would be interested in any discussion it provokes.",1704230515.0

I don’t want all my hard work to go to waste, but I feel like I haven’t really been living in so long. I’m constantly stressed out and overwhelmed and broke and feel guilty when I’m not working on my never ending to do list of working on writing songs or practices or video content or marketing or playlisting or merch or tours etc etc. Of course I know nothing worth while is going to be easy, but I feel so stuck in this loop of restless discontent all the time. Never feel like I’m doing enough and somehow always working on something. 

Wondering if anyone has any advice on how to keep following the path without burnout or trying a different approach that lets them enjoy life again.

I don’t want to give up my dreams, but I’m afraid the pursuit is going to make my life suck.

I know there’s a lot of people in the same boat, so saying it’s hard to have a day job and have not kill your creativity and time is hard echos true for a lot of people. 

For more context: Im 30, I’m a woman, I have a manager and a small label right now. A lot of people have dedicated themselves to my vision and I don’t want to let them down. Or my younger self who always wanted to do this and was too afraid. I don’t want to give up but I’m definitely having a little dark night of the soul right now.

9,Played my final live show,430,1b6hbx0,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1b6hbx0/played_my_final_live_show/,310,"I've been playing shows for the last 29 years including multiple tours throughout the USA, but last night was my final show.

When I first started playing shows, I fantasized about growing an audience, having been told that the more you do it, the better it gets. I played basements, rock clubs, art galleries, record stores, festivals, you name it. My band released records on a big indie label and has been reviewed in just about every magazine or website you can think of. We had a few really good, memorable shows throughout the years but our final tour was a disaster. If we had 5 people come to the show, it was a good night. When we got back home, we played a low key local show and exactly one person came.

In the early days, I thrived on playing to a few people in a basement. I had something to prove and cherished the opportunity to win over and connect with an audience, no matter how small. We even played a show to absolutely nobody because it was just fun to play! When we played that show to one person after decades of playing local and tour gigs, it hit me- I can't do it anymore. It hurt my feelings too much to continue. I shared my feelings with the other band members and we all agreed. We would continue to make records, but playing shows is a thing of the past.

I continued to play little tiny solo shows here and there, figuring that because it wasn't with my band, I wouldn't have any feelings tied up in it. Last night's show put an end to that. None of our thousands of fans wanted to come see me play, which wasn't surprising, but it affected me in a way that I couldn't shake. The opener had a few friends who were stoked to see him, but I had nobody except my wife and kid.

I'm old. I'm tired of being disappointed. It's time to close that chapter in my life. It's a bummer, but I still love writing/recording music, so I'll keep my focus on that.",1709574717.0

I invited her to an open mic on Valentine’s Day, 2018, where I would play one of my older songs and a new one that I had just written—for her.

The person who played before me was a crowd favorite, so that amped up the pressure. But no problem—my stuff is good too. I’ll get up there and prove myself. I’ll amaze this girl with the beauty of my music.

So I get up there…and crumble.

I couldn’t get accustomed to the mic. My pitch sounded bad—very, very bad. I had some false starts. I kept forgetting chords and lyrics. The best parts of these songs flopped badly. The audience was clearly unmoved and disinterested. By the end of the ordeal, my face was beet red and I was sweating. Of course, the audience clapped politely. I’m sure they pitied me and felt my embarrassment—which kind of made it worse.

And my date? She had to leave shortly thereafter. And then she ghosted me.

I think i have an understanding why. Guitar is seen as this cool rockstar thing when really its an instrument. You have to do exercises, study scales, learn to arpeggiate and solo, and many people think you can just do all these things right out of the gate. Guitar is seen differently because of how America and even the world has gone through phases with it. We have had people like Eddie Van Halen become sex icons with their guitars in hand. People see it as this sick cool thing when really its some nerd shit that takes hundreds of hours to get a smidge better at. People pick up the guitar for the first time, try to play a song far outside their reach, have no other motivation or inspiration than playing Infront of chicks and looking cool, and decide that its not worth the effort and give up.",1708829381.0

One customer was even present when the staff member told me to quiet down and actually told them off for me lol. I wouldn’t have been so direct myself. This is after I had closed the lid completely, used the soft pedal the whole time, and switched to soft easy listening music.
    
Seriously where to these people get off? It’s not the first time this has happened, it happens at restaurants too.
   
My dearest children, you set up a GRAND piano in an echo chamber, hired me after I sent in video clips and described clearly the kind of music that I play (Chopin, Liszt etc.), then complain about the noise? What do you want from me? Why waste money on a grand? Why waste money on my skills? Why have live music at all?
   
I know this is nothing new, but getting back into music after 10 years has made me much more aware of these things lately. The things we put up with for music.

Update: 
The mall manager who hired me responded. What she said: 
“What? Who said it was too loud? I loved listening to your playing from my office! Some of the store managers want you to come back every day haha!

However I did see a lot of people that are getting stuck on very tiny details regarding their songs, which is also understandable. 

Though, I feel like we as artists often get so consumed in the detail of our work that it paralyzes our ability to move forward.

The listener doesn't care about most the stuff a lot of artists are worried about. It might be an unpopular opinion but...

I think artists that actually want to do this full time at one point need to learn how to quickly create and move on to the next song. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.. The song you love, other people might hate.

Hence why it's better to put out work and discover what works along the way. Also, making music is one part, but marketing the music will be the most important thing if you ever want to make money from it.

For backstory, I have managed to gain a pretty large Soundcloud following of 23k people, sold many instrumentals on Youtube, worked with some ""big"" names in the industry out here in Europe and my music has been streamed 5-10 million times worldwide. 

The reason I really think this is important for upcoming artists that want to make a carreer out of it is because I have lost momentum at one point because I was a perfectionist, had I made sure to keep releasing and make content for Tiktok, IG etc. I would've been much further ahead right now.

Don't be your own worst enemy and try to get into the habit of releasing frequently and making Short Form content and improving on every aspect along the way.

He called me a month ago to say he procured a little gig at a community center event - four sets over two days with decent pay.  We could repeat a lot of material on the second day if we wanted to. 

I agreed because he and I still jam occasionally and we know a lot of songs together. 

First issue was that I’m drumming instead of playing bass.  That’s cool, I can hang with that.

At the first practice he informs us that he wants to do a bunch of new material.

We were having trouble getting everyone in the room at the same time.  No big deal, I’ve pulled off lots of shows with little to no rehearsal.

We’re all seasoned musicians who have been playing for years and the material wasn’t actually difficult.  

And I was told that the women who is running the event would come up and sing a few of the new songs with us so nobody bothered  to fully learn the words. 

As the big day approached it became more and more obvious to me that it wasn’t going to go well but I figured we’d pull it off. 

Then the two days became one, which cut the pay in half. 

This last week I’ve been coughing for several days and losing my voice.  I’ve been drinking hot tea with honey and lemon multiple times a day.

The night before the show we were still learning and arranging material. 

On the way to the venue I almost totaled my car because some asshole missed his exit and cut in front of me.  I found myself navigating between two cars heading right for a guardrail and a sign. All the while a semi and an SUV were barreling up behind me horns blaring. 

It was pants-shitting scary but I survived. 

I managed to miss every obstacle in my way and bobbed and weaved through the chaos while my drum set was flying around behind me performing a ghost drum solo.

It’s a RIMS headset and it wasn’t secured very well. (My bad) and a cymbal arm and the tom mount on the bass drum both broke in the near-accident. 

It’s a kind of rare drum set from the 80’s and the parts will cost me more than I made at the gig.  

I set the kit up anyway.  

Then there was no power on the stage.

And then there was but it kept tripping the breakers.

The portable stage was powered by a generator and something kept tripping the breakers. 

And nobody brought a PA.  I was assured that the venue had a system we could play through but it was just two powered speakers, no mixer, no monitors. 

The thing is, I have a PA and I offered to bring it and set it up. All four members of the band own PA’s that we could have brought but no…they have a system there…

After over an hour of fucking around we cobbled together one microphone going through one speaker.

And then one of the guitarist’s amps quit working on the middle of a song.

By this point I was rethinking every life decision I’ve ever made

The thing is, I saw it coming - the lack of rehearsal time, band members not familiar with the material, shitty equipment, crackly cables, wobbly-ass mic stands, guitars falling off of janky straps - you name it.",1695650988.0

Overnight, he went from having 3K followers to a staggering 200K on Instagram and half a million on TikTok, with his Spotify garnering 10 million listeners and reaching the number 1 spot on global charts. 

I am genuinely pleased to see my friend experience this success because his songs are great. I am just frustrated and feeling hopeless because this success seemed entirely random; his song went viral without much effort or consistency on his part - he made the song, hasn't really been posting much TikToks and doesn't know much about marketing; just posted a TikTok (nothing special) and it popped off. While you may suggest it's an attestation that his success means others can do it too.. it's disheartening seeing other artists including this friend who have some other OUTSTANDING songs, market them so much, put so much effort into writing/production/marketing... and nothing happens. 

It feels like success in the music industry boils down to luck so much.... leaving us feeling demotivated and overlooked despite our efforts.

Anyone felt the same? Any advice?",1712252711.0

43,Why are musicians so damn flakey? ,206,1bfghv2,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1bfghv2/why_are_musicians_so_damn_flakey/,191,"I’m a drummer that lives in Nashville and has a full time job, while drumming on the side for a side hustle.  I’m a part of a Facebook group where a lot of people involved in the entertainment industry in the area can network with one another, and I tend to offer to play for free to help out the artists. I’ve met people who I’ve done gigs with through that group, so I’ve long considered it a good resource.

However, the pattern as of late has been this:

1. I’ll see a post on the page asking for a drummer for a gig.

2. I’ll friend request the poster and send an inquiry on Messenger introducing myself and providing links to stuff I’ve played on.

3. They’ll respond and say “Let’s get together and talk/jam.”  I’ll respond with times I’m available, and they’ll leave me read and not respond.

I would think for a city like Nashville that people would be a lot better than this, and it’s starting to get annoying.  I just want to make some great music.

Has anyone else experienced this?

I have 7 years in the music industry and a master's degree in music business and audio engineering. 

If ANYONE messages you on your social media about promotion, interviews, radio play, submitting a demo, auditions, etc. Then immediately ask for money. It's a SCAM. No questions asked, it's a scam.

1. Labels don't charge for demo submissions.

2. Radio pays you to play your song, not the other way around.

3. Interviews are invitations not to be paid for unless you're staging one for a press kit or your own promotion.

4. Auditions are also invitations, if you're being asked to pay for a spot it's all bullshit. You could think it's the best thing in the world but everyone could hate it. You're gambling every time you post a song. 

Don't fall for them saying they can guarantee any to you. Music is never a guarantee. It's art, so it's subjective.

I am so sick and tired of seeing people get taken advantage of because they know how badly musicians want to be heard. I have clients ask me every week if a proposal from a fake Instagram is real.

I just read the third post this week, where someone that never really even tried is bitter and jealous of anyone having any success. Most don’t even realize that what they’re jealous of is some fantasy in their heads that doesn’t exist to begin with… Being a full-time musician is not some pie in the sky fantastical dream. If you’re willing to put in the work, you can do it. Move to Nashville and  play on Broadway 40 hours a week with the occasional weekend run in the van… it ain’t glamorous, but that’s being a full-time musician and you don’t have to be a virtuoso to do it either.

Many people live in this delusional headspace where they’re much better than they actually are, and are shocked when they put their music out online and get no traction and have no fans… Number one, you’re probably not as good as you think you are and number two, there is so much more to it than simply releasing music. 

I have many talented friends in Nashville that move here, do very little, and then are shocked that the world isn’t falling at their feet… The people that I have seen do some things work their butts off 24 seven are fully aware of and actually play the game… Admittedly that’s not for everyone but it is what it is.

What’s the game? From what I’ve seen it’s compromise, persistence, patience, a gimmick and money. I don’t know what order of importance those go in, but it takes all of them.

Let me guess you’re an artist and don’t have a  gimmick? Do you think John Tardy from Obituary uses his speaking voice 🤣? Everything is a gimmick, whether you realize it or not.  

What have you really done? Have you moved away from home? Have you put yourself out there? Ever been on the road? Ever been homeless? Ever played gigs with people you don’t like and music you don’t like? Have you played 1000 gigs yet wherever you are? I guarantee had you done any of that you would have a lot to be proud of when you look in the rearview mirror… So many outcomes are beyond our control, but I bet you wouldn’t feel bitter and jealous if you had actually put the work in. 

In my opinion, what keeps people up at night is knowing they never really tried not lack of perceived success by the outside world.

Hope this doesn’t come off as obnoxious, but geez people need to get over themselves a little bit and be proud of themselves for what they’ve done and be happy for others for what they’ve achieved..

I'm white, from a super small, protestant evangelical town.  My family was very loving, and discouraged me from this pursuit out of a genuine fear of poverty-- they had worked so hard to escape it and wanted to ensure I'd never endure it or my children.

I've done a lot, had some professional success-- I mean I worked my ass off to survive as we all do, trying to pay debts and have a decent living space. I did get a management position at a hospital, I created a language services department and created 9 new positions of interpreters-- something the hospital desperately needed.  I was too overwhelmed to continue, had a nervous breakdown...

I never had kids.

My boyfriend called these ladies hags the other day, and inside I died knowing that it'd only take post pregnancy or some 5 more years for him to see me that way.

And I know I'm conflating a lot.  I feel like I have been so busied by so much work, so much fear of the economy, of economic stability, that I didn't live.  And now that I'm making music, the person whose opinion means the most to me in the world says I'm boring, safe, and don't push any limits.

And that's been the case my whole life.  That's why I am where I am.  I think I was always a coward, I must still be, and now my music just reflects that I am.

This must sound like a white woman cry-- because it is and I am and I wish I could disappear.

Even though I enjoyed playing out it was draining and I also worried it would reflect poorly on me. I'm not perfect but I recognize when I mess up and practice. He didn't seem to do this and actually would get annoyed we didn't know the songs he had just come up with. So I stopped playing. 

He's reached out about playing again. Apparently he's had trouble finding backing musicians, so I feel bad. But I am wary of being in more bad shows.

I played the guitar since being a teenager and I can truly call it a passion. Then bad luck hit hard and I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in my mid-twenties. Since then, playing guitar was impossible because I could not use my left hand and wrist as I would have needed to play. I tried some other instruments (no music has never been an option), but it just never was ""my"" instrument. I play a quite good Blues harmonica now, but still.

Some days ago I bought a 3 string cigar box guitar out of couriosity and IT IS POSSIBLE! I'm sitting here playing my first songs and riffs since 12 damn years and have tears of joy running down my face. 3 strings don't get that fiddly for arthritic fingers and a small neck helps too. What's happening here is finding a possibily to do what you love after you more or less thought it to be impossible and that those days were gone forever.

Sometimes you need to tell the world how you feel. Today I am the happiest guitarist alive, my friends.

An astonishing number of acts featured one or more musicians who found themselves unable to play because a battery or a cord failed, etc.

In most cases, I was able to bridge the gap because I brought extra batteries, cords, picks, strings, etc., for exactly this scenario but there were a few cases that I couldn’t save. 

So, if you’ve got a gig, please take a moment the night before or the morning of to check your rig, make sure everything works, and maybe think about bringing along supplies and tools you might need in the moment: strings and a winder, picks, batteries, cords, drum key, etc.

And most importantly, don’t be a dick if your gear fails. Much more often than not, it’s nobodies fault but yours.

Yeah that rapper kinda sucks and has millions but he also is himself and took his music and art seriously and went and learned the professional route to producing and marketing a record.

Even your favorite great artists or underground artists, they didn't get traction until they got professional help in some shape or form and they invested thousands and thousands into even the earliest records

Get references, and inspiration, plan hard and invest into a more professional route, to the rappers out there, even Kanye has to have his beats go through multiple people and levels of mastering

But, I do make my own music and will most likely eventually get a band together and do the DIY music thing like make records and merchandise and play local shows or whatnot. I used to play in a couple of bands in my 20's but it was nothing serious.

My buddy used to be in a couple of bands, but they never went anywhere or got big. One of the bands I thought was pretty good. He keeps telling me that there's no money in music, even for production people and that me starting out at 43 is late and that I should stick with video. He's saying that even roadies with big touring bands that run the house mix or set up audio or the A2's don't make diddly squat, and being just a supporting musician for a big star or big act, or decent act for that matter pays next to nothing. Not to mention streaming doesn't pay anything.

Am I wasting my time on this music thing? I just love music, I think it's great and I wanna be around it and make a living. I'm over doing video, there's nothing that cool for me anymore in it. Music is cool and fun to me.

Went to the bar  talked the the man behind the bar turns out he was the owner opened this place coz he just loves live music and then he gave me a free beer! 

Quick sound check and then we were up there doing the thing jumping round like mad, I was quite nervous coz I’m not a gigger, but I thought to myself fuck it man I wanna look back at this when I’m older and think yeah I really did that. Everyone was dancing and hooting and hollering and then I stepped on my lead and pulled it out of the amp during the song and guess what, no one noticed hell I even forgot about it till this morning coz my mate reminded me and we laughed. 

Anyways we walk off stage and the venue was like a long hallway so we have to walk down the other end to pack our shit up. As we were walking past and everyone was like that was amazing you guys are great and hi fiving us asking for our socials (we don’t have any still :S) all complete strangers giving compliments.

I said I bet you say that to all the bands and he assured us he didn’t and says especially if they are out here coz he shouldn’t leave the bar unattended.

I’m a drummer in an indie/emo/altertnative ish band. We’ve been putting on quite a few free shows at one of our band members houses. We haven’t done many shows where we charge.

You can’t even get a meal at McDonald’s for $2. A lot of our shows where we have had people have to pay to see us, there’s been a big chunk of their friends who ask if they could get sneaked in, and the band members have complied.

I was driving past a skate park a few years ago when I noticed a dude with fantasticly curly hair ripping it on the bass with a band. I got quite a few blocks away when I had a thought ‘if I don’t turn around I’m gonna regret it.’ So I turned around and watched the gig. I wanted to talk to the lead singer after the show and I was shitting bricks nervous. While waiting in line to talk to him I turned over to the curly haired bass guy and made conversation with him since he was standing there quietly. And shockingly I wasn’t nervous, I was able to represent myself authentically and relaxed because talking to him was a relief compared to the big scary lead singer. 

Never ended up talking with the lead singer much but I did get the bassist’s socials and Spotify. And holy shit I was floored- he only had 9 monthly listeners (for his solo work) but something about his music resonated with every atom of my being. At the time I discovered his music I was in a major mental health crisis and all of my creative abilities were 6 feet underground. I also had no grasp of my creative voice. His music helped bust the coffin door off. I was upset he lived 14 hours away because I felt like I needed to know him. 

Fast forward a couple years to now and I still admire his work so much. I asked him to be a producer on my record and he gave me an enthusiastic yes!! 

So far it’s been unreal. I feel like I can speak so plainly to him and I don’t have to translate or filter myself. I feel like I can be my authentic weird self and have strange ideas and he’ll embrace them. He’s sent me back some of my stuff after he worked on it and I’ve genuinely gotten teary eyed. He’s had a hand in bringing me so close to my creative voice and the stuff he’s done with my work is exactly what I’m looking for!! It’s cool seeing my music come to life and I trust him with my precious musical babies. He also told me that he finds that our voices work really well together. 

I’ve been curious if there’s such a thing as people you are destined to collab with? Or people who were supposed to make music together? Maybe I’m off my rocker, but it just seems so whacky that he happened to be in town that day so many years back when I was driving by and I had that feeling that I needed to turn around or I would regret it.

120,15 years of music marketing taught me this:,121,13fnsag,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/13fnsag/15_years_of_music_marketing_taught_me_this/,58,"Every campaign, artist, and goal is unique. Therefore, every marketing strategy should reflect that simple fact. That's why most music marketing services out there are empty carbs. 

They aren't unique or customized. They're too often generic and sketchy systems that don't build what an artist needs most...a fan base that engages with the artist's work and wants to explore more of it.

That's because these bs systems don't focus on relationship building between fan and artist. They focus on inflated stream numbers and follows that don't translate to long-term engagement.

It takes time to build strong and deep relationships with people and the same is true for loyal music fans. 

Anyone selling a strategy that gets fans or streams fast or only costs a few hundred dollars is probably cutting corners and not worth an artist's time/money.

Their sketchy system or ""proprietary audience"" is also going to hurt an artist’s algorithmic scores on social media and digital streaming platforms. Their AI algorithms know the difference between legit fan engagement and inflation tactics.

I see a ton of artists wasting their shoestring budgets on “plug and chug” methods like ""follow for follow"" and ""stream for stream"" schemes, third-party playlist placements, and simple ads/boosts.

They're too generic to work and likely to do more harm than good.

Artists don’t need a simple hack or “get streams/followers quick” scheme. They need a real long term strategy and the system that both grows and and nurtures their existing audience.

Quality marketing is customized, consistent, and moves specific listeners in a unique, meaningful way, so they become excited fans.

Commercial success is achieved from building relationships with fans and industry professionals over time—using many pieces/forms of content. 

An artist must build a rapport with a listener before the listener actually cares enough to become a fan or the connection that unlocks an artists career.

This is precisely why quality is always more important than quantity. Artists, agents, and managers have to think less about scale and more about deepening connection.

- Unfortunately, social media isn’t very generous with organic reach, even to people already following. So artists need to learn how to use paid ads to retarget people engaging to get seen.

- Playlists are nice when they’re reputable, but it's often hard to get on the good ones. While they might increase streams, they have very low fan conversion rates.

- PR isn’t relevant for indies the way it was 10 years ago. It’s really expensive and hardly ever worth the time and cost anymore. Most fans discover new indie music on social media and streaming platforms, not blogs and magazines.

- Online courses are most often teaching an oversimplified hack that doesn’t work for most artists. Some can be useful, but it can be hard to decipher.

- Touring is a ton of work and energy, but a great way to connect with listeners and sell merch. Performing cities a few times a year can go a long way with deepening relationships and artists success.

- By far the most beneficial and cost effective way to market music is with solid content, targeted conversion ads, and a keen eye for data analytics.

Live performance, frequent organic posts to socials, and an effective ads system can go a long way.

The average artist isn’t going to be able to hop on a stage and wow an audience after taking an online course and the same goes for marketing their music.

An effective music marketing campaign is as sophisticated as any piece of well produced music. So thinking an artists can “pick it up” quickly is compete bs.

For artists looking to work with an ads expert, BEWARE of services that don't include a 1-on-1 consultation with a person and run ads on their own Meta or Google ad account, rather than the artist’s.

Far too often, ad managers or agencies that don’t set up the ads on the artist's account are intentionally harvesting the artist’s ads data for their own gain, concealing sketchy practices, and overcharging because the artist doesn’t know better. 

Owning your own data and demanding transparency is paramount. It’s your business and they’re contractors. Keep your own data in-house.

At the end of the day, difference between commercially successful artists and everyone else almost always comes down to their branding, marketing, and how they interact with existing fans.

Most of the 4 main ways to make money as an indie artist require engaged fans, not casual streamers:
- live concert
- merch
- crowdfunding
- sync

For the past 15 years, I've been a professional musician, artist manager, and music biz consultant.

These actions have gotten me in a bit of bother. A great guitarist and good friend of mine was this kind of player who didn't practice.

1) I’m 27, I’m not “kids-these-days”ing

2) In my experience older musicians exemplify this problem even more so, in general - obviously, nothing is black and white.

3) I’m levying this criticism at myself, too.

**Anyway,** I’ve been in many scenes in my time, I have attended and gigged all the gigs, and something I’ve noticed is that very little of the rock/blues I’ve heard *or played* has scratched the rock/blues itch I’m aiming at. This is maybe especially true of house bands at jam nights. 

The issue isn’t really musical, it’s vibes. So much of the rock/blues scene is so *sterilised*. It’s safe. It should not be safe, the heart of this music is *the opposite of safe*. I don’t care how good you are at guitar, I don’t care how flashy your fills are, I don’t even care how good a voice you have. I want to walk into a disgusting basement club and have your kick drum punch me in the throat. I want grit, I want sex appeal, I want gross, unwashed bohemians screaming because they’ve been singing for eight hours and their voice has given out. I want to see sweat running down the walls of a room that could safely hold 20 but somehow has a hundred waiting at the bar.

Give me the hamburg Beatles, give me the early Stones, give me the Sex Pistols, give me pre-fame Nirvana. Walk up on stage like you own the place and scream a song you wrote yesterday about how you want to overthrow the government or screw your neighbour’s mom. Just please hit your guitar like you want the strings to break. No more classics, no more 48 bar solos, play like it’s 1959 and you’re on an ungodly amount of speed.

I’ve played in a bunch of bands. I’m most often the guitarist, but I’ve also been the bassist, drummer and vocalist.

A lot of people (pretty much only non-musicians) think it’s surprising I play more than one instrument.
Like, the first instrument I told my coworker I played was bass, and she always assume I play bass in my band when I’ve told her multiple times I’m the guitarist in my band.

I’ve been in my city’s music scene for most of a decade, and easily the majority of musicians I know play more than one instrument and like myself have played different instruments in different bands.

It seems like a lot of people have this idea that a person dedicates themself to one instrument for life.

The only musicians I know that only play one instrument are either drummers, or they’re like a classical or jazz musician with formal education/training.

I see my peers go viral, get playlisted, get radio play and playing gigs every week. I constantly stalk their numbers and see how mine are barely existent.

I truly believe my art and music is good enough, but I lack the willpower and nerve to put myself out there enough. I have tried my best to network but due to not being a conventionally attractive girl in the industry I struggle immensely to connect on a authentic level as they are superficial. 

This is no excuse but I am very alone in the world as I only have my brother and friends (my family isn’t in my life). I have never had a stable place to call home and I long for a peace and love I lack right now feeling like a failure next to my amazing peers. I don’t know if I should keep going or accept that I don’t want to give more of myself as it’s making me unhappy as of now.

EDIT:
Thank you for all the lovely replies. This morning I started missing the fun of writing songs and remembered why I even started doing music to begin with. All the different opinions and stories you have commented reminded me that being born with a creative drive is something beautiful, and regardless the outcome it’s a talent we should celebrate wether it’s alone in the rehearsal room or in front of a big crowd. I finally sat down and made a new playlist (it’s been 1 year since my last) and suddently I feel a little more alive again. I had forgotten how amazing it feels to discover new music…

In two weeks I have my final exam concert, a 40 min set with all my original work. I worked so hard and made a team of my band, strings, sax, dancers and a choir. I’ll cherish the performance and be proud of doing what I always longed for.🥹",1712061983.0

I've been writing and producing music for about 10+ years, but stage performance has always petrified me. It was fine to be able to record and tweak everything ""to perfection"", but I've always just been crippled with nerves and haven't ever performed publicly, beyond my family.

I turned 30 this year, and whatever possessed me, I sucked it up and I sang/played one of my original songs at an open mic in my city.

I know full well if I saw a recording of my performance I'd be mortified, but I'm still feeling kinda high from it. Thankfully everyone there was super nice anyway, and I already can't wait to practice for the next one.

I also didn't tell any of my friends or family I was doing it, so I was there totally solo. They'd have been supportive and I'm lucky to have them, but honestly it just felt like a thing I needed to do on my own.



Sorry for gushing, but.. since I hadn't told anyone I know, and I plan on doing at least a few more solo, I gotta unload here!

Rock bands and live music people - please continue to work on phasing out floor monitors and switching over to IEMs.  - especially for rehearsals.  

Venues/promotors - provide ear plugs to anyone who needs them when booking loud bands.  

We all love live music. Let's enjoy it as long as we can!

Guitar players / singers who don't like using ear plugs because you can't hear yourself - you need to get over it and buy yourself IEMs.  It's not worth losing your hearing just so you can personally hear your own tone.  The house never hears what you hear on stage anyway.  Learn to catch a vibe without making others uncomfortable.  

I honestly don't understand why singers don't exclusively use IEMs.  You can hear yourself way better than in a monitor and never have to stress your voice ( unless you want to creativity).  Stop relying on venues to provide you with loud monitors.",1702925179.0

Would you rather they leave your show wanting more, or leave your show feeling glad that your set is finally over?

I've definitely noticed this myself seeing bands that play longer sets - if I don't really like them, it's painful to sit though a long set. If I do like them at first, if they drag the set on they tend to lose me towards the end. It's only if I really really like them will I enjoy the longer set, and that's like 5% of bands. Not saying that 95% of bands suck, they just don't align with my tastes that I want to listen to their music for 45+ minutes straight. And that's gonna be true of most people.

something like a 30 minute set is a lot better IMO. First of all, you can pick your best songs and so there's a better chance more people will like you to begin with. You have more wiggle room to pick songs that would fit the vibe of the venue / crowd. If people still don't like you, they don't have to sit through that long of a set and they're not going to associate you with a negative memory. If they do like you, you're gonna leave them wanting more, and they're more likely to look you up after the show to hear more. 

Now, I'm not saying that you should play for 20 minutes if you're getting paid for 60. But you really should err on the side of less is more.",1694615831.0

170,Does Your Music Suck?,96,14n7teb,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/14n7teb/does_your_music_suck/,155," 

For the past three years I’ve been running a podcast interview project focused on underground/undiscovered/or otherwise unknown musicians.  
 I began this project because I wanted to give something back to music after decades of my own personal relationship with music. I found that most mainstream podcast/music shows focus on big name artists or industry recognizable names. I wanted to go the other direction, to find people recording in their bedrooms, or people playing instruments on the street, or just people who learned to play an instrument for the love of music.

Over the past three years I’ve conducted over 200 interviews with people all over the country and world at various levels in their career and with various levels of participation in music. It's been a truly humbling experience and infinitely motivational.

What I’ve learned from everyone I’ve interviewed is that although we all have our own passionate relationship with music, everyone has a unique perspective on what that means to them and how they’ve allowed it to interact with their lives. Some people have casual participation that allows them to express themselves, and that is their concept of being successful. While others are driven to reach into the stars and have a definition of success that puts the bar so high they may never reach it, just to keep themselves motivated to keep going.

Although everyone has their own relationship with how they define success, there is a consistent message that resonates across these interviews. You are never too old, too young, too inexperienced, too incapable, or too “successful” to begin learning an instrument or making music. All you need is motivation.

As with anything subjective, sometimes you won’t like what you make, sometimes others won’t like what you make, but the consensus is the same. If you want to do it, you should, and do it unapologetically, you should feel empowered to explore your own creativity to the very depths of what that means to you. That may seem like an obvious trope to some, but some people need to hear that, and need to be told it's ok to make music that only they like. Not all music is made with the intention of being a commercial success. In fact most music is made out of catharsis as a form of therapeutic release. It is all valid, and it is all “music”.

This project has truly been amazing! To speak to so many talented musicians, and hear how music has impacted their lives has been an honor they all trusted me with.  I’m not very good at social media postings or podcast marketing, but I wish I were so I could get more traffic to these people that have taken the time to participate in this project.   
 I’m not adding any links to this post because I don’t want it to be viewed as self-promotion and get flagged. So, if you want to listen to these interviews, you can find them pretty much everywhere. There are links on my profile to Youtube and Spotify. I also post them to r/ManifestBrutality  
 With that being said. I intend to continue these interviews with musicians who wish to share their stories and experiences across the world. It really has been an amazing journey since I started. My goal is to be able to work on this project full-time, and I’m hoping to make that a reality.   
 If you have any questions about this, or anything else. I’m happy to have a discussion.  
 In closing, keep making music, keep exploring what music means to you.   
 Don’t give up, don’t let anyone tell you you’re not good enough or to stop.

I'm a 39-year-old female and I have a great singing voice, I live in a  vacation town that has a high rate of working musicians (live music for tourists). After my divorce a year ago and leaving a high-control religion, I vowed to myself that I would one day go out and perform. The day has come! But how on earth do I get started? 

I'm not a stranger to performing, I used to lead worship at a mega-church (smoke machines, in-ear monitors, $1mil sound equipment - the works) but I haven't done the type of live music that my town is known for, and I'm also completely an outsider to that community. I'm also an outsider to my former church community because I no longer follow that religion. 

I have a lot of excuses, and it's time to stop making them. 

I am ready to make this happen.

184,Important Advice for Musicians,91,zzkvc1,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/zzkvc1/important_advice_for_musicians/,33,"If you're looking into the new year and thinking *""I would like more gigs""* or *""I need to maintain the number of gigs that I get""* obviously practising your musicianship and perfecting your ability on your instrument or voice is critical*.* Still, I'm going to pass on some key advice that requires no practice at all. 

If you ever feel like you want to criticise or bitch about another musician who is playing in the same scene as you just tell yourself to **SHUT UP**. If you want to get booked, **NEVER** be that guy that constantly has to have something to say about other players. 

&#x200B;

**Main Reasons Why**

&#x200B;

1. **If you choose to bitch about someone it's always going to get back to you.** The music world is very small so even in a large city, your comments will always come back to bite you. I have come across players losing out on great opportunities just cause they decided to be music critics after challenging gigs. The scary thing is, no-one will tell you why your phone isn't ringing as they are not going to confront you. People will just start deleting your number when you bitch about their close friends. Even amazing musicians at the top of their craft lose work just because they come across as judgmental arseholes. Gigs are so challenging when you play with someone who is judgmental, you won't believe the effort that people go through to avoid working with certain individuals. 
2. **No good musician actually wants to hear your opinion.** If you try to strike up a conversation with a good musician about how a guitarist soloing is ""too samey"" or that the drummer on a gig is ""not tight enough"" you need to remember t*hat they honestly don't care and would rather not hear what you want to say*. All of the great musicians that I have worked with practice modesty and they are extremely humble about their craft. They know that you will always be learning as a musician and any attempt at learning should be supported and encouraged. The only appropriate setting where you would criticise a fellow musician is in a lesson or masterclass, but it's constructive criticism. When you give your opinion right after a performance you just sound very stupid. 
3. **It's a major red flag that you are insecure.** When you observe a musician laying down weird ""hot takes"" about the performers after a gig it's almost always coming from a place of insecurity. All they're doing is comparing themself to the performers on stage and they are jealous that they can't perform to the same level or thinking *""I'm better than all of those musicians on stage and that gives me some fulfilment.""* These guys have their own issues to deal with and you wouldn't want to work with them if you had the choice. ALSO, going to gigs should be an inspiring experience. Your musical training should enable you to appreciate live performances more than a non-musician. Like an artist going into a gallery and being inspired by each painting, you should be embracing live music without judgment. 
4. **Eventually, your inner critic will make you hate** ***your own musical practice.*** I've sadly witnessed this too often. Musicians that tend to bitch and criticise others burn out faster as their inner voice becomes too critical of their own performance practice. Daily Practice becomes harder when you are constantly battling with an inner dialogue that you apply to people that you don't respect. If you don't approach listening to others with compassion, mindfulness and appreciation then how are *you* going to *PLAY* in a way where you can inspire that in your own music? If all you think of are ways to shame musicians then you're going to constantly shame yourself when you perform. That's never fun. 

&#x200B;

This post comes as a reflection after having this conversation with many very talented and wholesome musicians, they all preach the same thing. Don't be stupid and negative toward other musicians. Support your fellow musicians and encourage them to reach their potential, this career is fucking hard enough. People will flock to work with you when you approach any interaction or gig with compassion and kindness. If you feel triggered by this post and carry on to do the opposite... good luck.",1672459474.0

I’ve been thinking about this for a while. Almost every guitarist and musician that I really like is also focused heavily on something else. Music might be their number one thing, but they also do a lot of other things. Maybe they have an interest in another type of art like painting or acting, or maybe they love history or sports, and they seem just as comfortable doing those things as they do with music. Even if music is their number one thing, then it’s still possible that it takes up the greatest percentage of their mental bandwidth but still uses up less than the combination of everything else. For example, 40% music, then 30% history and 30% exercise. I feel like I rarely see interviews with musicians I love where they talk about music like it’s literally their whole personality.

I think this rings true for a couple of reasons. One, it’s good to take breaks. Doing so often makes you come back with a clearer head and stronger motivation than obsession ever could. Two, I believe that in order to output art, you need input. If your only input is other art, then you’re going to make a lot of derivative art. Art is always derivative in some way, but it’s always more authentic sounding to me when I can hear the personal interests in the music either lyrically or some other way, like progressions that sound inspired by something outside of just what the artist usually listens to. I know there are more reasons that this makes sense to me but I can’t think of them right now. Probably need to take a break.

The point being, it may seem like making music your whole thing is a good way to excel, but I’d argue that it will end up limiting your ability and creativity.

To those of you this seems obvious to, that’s good! To those of you who disagree, I’m happy to discuss this further. What are your thoughts?",1707500269.0

A bit of context: I joined a blues rock band over a year ago as a singer. It's a group of four friends from the same village, all in their forties, and I'm the newcomer, the youngest, the girl... 
I got back into music after a long break and I really clicked with the atmosphere. We don't have any ambitions other than having fun. At first, I was finding my groove, no problem, but the more we progress, the more I feel limited.

Well, they're not great musicians, they know it, but I don't hold it against them; playing for fun is also good, and I have another more serious project on the side. I won't dwell on all the problems, because ultimately, they'd probably all be solved if we had a decent drummer.

But our drummer is a nightmare. Can't keep the beat, gets lost in the songs, and is very (very) limited technically. It's awful. I've put in a lot of effort to help him improve, but everything I try fails.

I know that without him, everything would be better, and in fact, I took advantage of a day when he wasn't there to suggest to the others to play along with a drum machine. They played better than ever and they noticed it. 
But here's the thing: as bad as our drummer may be, he's also a good guy. And especially, he's the mega buddy of the two guitarists. So, I don't come out as a winner if there's ever an open ""conflict"" except that...

...They've also all noticed that I push them to do better. Let's say that my outsider perspective encourages them to challenge themselves more than they did before, just among friends... And I can see that they feel inspired to try more complicated things. They would definitely be capable of it with another drummer, once again.

So, the question is:
How do I convince them to say goodbye to the drummer?
Or from your experiences, is it a lost cause, and should I leave the ship or keep my mouth shut? (Which would be ironic for a singer...).

Edit: thanks so much for all of your thoughtful comments. I was feeling depressed after the show last night and I guess I needed to be reminded that its not the end of the world when you have a bad gig. We've been playing as a band for 10 years and I gave up on ""making it"" long ago. I was just frustrated, because we play mostly originals and it always seems to be the cover bands playing the same two dozen classic rock songs that get the big turnout. We're good at what we do and I feel sometimes we deserve more of a reception, but I need to stop feeling entitled and just enjoy the music we play.

230,What 20 years of playing in venues has taught me:,77,153wc40,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/153wc40/what_20_years_of_playing_in_venues_has_taught_me/,53,"Gigs are fun, yes they can be stressful at times but knowing what to do and what to expect always helps. It's all about being prepared and leaving a lasting impression.

Over the last 20 years I've been played in countless venues and over that time I've learnt what makes me feel at ease,   
 what's help me become more professional and importantly what's helped me secure more gigs.

**So on that note, here's my top 10 of unwritten rules that only experience has taught me.**

&#x200B;

1. Remember you're working and representing the venue you’re playing at. It’s important to act professionally and create a friendly atmosphere within the venue. Stay focused and keep safety in mind at all times.
2.  Although things can sometimes go wrong (it’s not always in our control), it’s always important to not show stress. Even if you’re not feeling that confident or perhaps you’re feeling a bit nervous, try and maintain an enthusiastic and positive attitude at all times.
3. Be considerate and humble. You’ve been chosen to play at somebody's venue. Appreciate the opportunity and always treat the staff and customers with respect. This won’t go unnoticed and leads to getting rebooked. Leave your ego at home!
4. Further to point 3. Remember that you were booked to play, **not** your friends. Equipment is expensive and venue owners can get nervous with others around ‘their’ expensive equipment. It’s great to bring friends along to support you but they also reflect on you and the venue if seen as being part of the entourage! Respect the venue's rules.
5. Be prepared! Organisation is key to being professional. Check what equipment you need to bring before you arrive. Does the venue already have equipment? Do you need your own microphone? What time can you arrive to set up? What is the fee being paid or that you’re requesting for your services? These are all key questions to ask BEFORE the gig, not during the night.
6. Check the timings. What time will you need to start playing? How long will you need to perform a sound check? What time will you need to finish playing? If playing with others then check the set times and that you have adequate time to move, unplug, set up your things.
7. Being open minded and humble. It’s always good to learn more skills, if you’re playing with others then embrace the different styles and approaches others have. You may learn something new or even pass on some tips to other people.
8. Be helpful and proactive. Should you bring other supplies? Can you assist fellow musicians and the venue beyond the ‘normal’ responsibilities? Sharing social media posts, handing out flyers, leaving reviews after your gig to help promote the venues. The more helpful you can be, the more respected and popular you will be with the venues and others.
9. A big one! Handle requests from customers/staff diplomatically. Always be polite, let people down gently if you’re unable to play their request. Sometimes it’s easier to say ‘I’m really sorry , I don’t have that’ or 'we're unable to do that one I'm afraid' rather than ‘That song’s terrible’ or ‘Yeah, I’ll play it later’ and then never playing it.

10. Not every gig will go as imagined, things can and will go wrong. Remember it’s always best to address any issues/problems at the end of the night with the relevant person. Don’t moan to the venue staff or cleaner. Take the concern to the management or booking manager directly. This helps maintain professionalism.

So I hope this has helped and it would be great to hear your thoughts and perhaps any other tips you have which have helped you in the past.

I have practiced guitar for 10 or 15 years. I consider myself myself intermediate.

I practiced scales and a few songs and have written one. That got me interested in recording.

I am 33 and live with my father and work part time as a delivery driver. I have a few bills to pay and take care of a lot of cats. 

I took the risk and bought a laptop and basic recording equipment (headphones, microphone, and interphase) which I owe on credit. 

I don't know what my prospects are. I think I could join a band but I'm going through a stage in my life where I'm becoming aware of my limitations. It sounds embarrassing, but I like a lot of my dreams are impractical. I'm just doing this to do it then.

That's me. Any advice would help. 

Oh yeah, and I live in Houston.

233,Never meet your heroes,78,16exy1b,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/16exy1b/never_meet_your_heroes/,91,"My experience with a band I looked up to.

I'm a death metal drummer first and foremost, been playing for a long time and started honing my skills in the last 4 or 5 years. My band I've been playing drums in has slowed down immensely so I've been looking for a new band to jam with/perform in. 

There's this one band local-ish to my area. Not a huge by any means but they do have a significant following. Signed to a major metal label, put out two records on said label, did some touring in the United States and played some underground festivals in Europe. Their guitar player put out on Instagram that he was looking for bassists, drummers, and lead guitarists that would want to perform some shows in the band.

Now this band I've looked up to a bit, especially from a drumming standpoint, but also from a guitar playing standpoint as well with their intricate rhythms, mind bending melodies, and fretless bass. Their original drummer is still currently a big influence on me currently, but he went on to play in other, much bigger death metal bands that I'd also consider to be huge influences on my drumming.

Anyway, I sent a message saying I was interested in playing drums, looking for a band to get more serious with. I wasn't expecting a response honestly at all but then he did, saying some really weird shit.

First message he sent was ""Hey I just listened to your bandcamp, you are absolutely unskilled, what made you think you'd ever join -name of band-, is this a joke lol.""

I'm like what?? I know I'm not the greatest drummer of all time but this response was way too outta pocket and we ended up getting into an argument that lasted roughly an hour and a half. He kept saying weird shit. 

He asked me if I wanted to make a bet, if I could learn one of their new songs in a week and play it flawlessly I front of him id get a CD copy of their new album. I was tempted on doing it not even for the CD, but to just flat out prove him wrong.

He even made a very vague threat that read like this.

""I don't have time for this, I'm from the hood.""

Like what does this even mean lol.

After all this, he eventually just said that he already had a drummer anyway. When I asked him why didn't he just say that in the first place instead of starting an argument, he just said, ""I wanted to have some fun, who said bands always had to be serious?"" 

That was basically the end of that conversation. 

Seriously what the fuck just happened lol. I was never rude to him at all, just responded to his Instagram post and met with immediate hostility. I don't think I've ever actually experienced anything like this before. Hell, no response would have been better.

We never got really ""big""/made it a full time job but practiced, and gigged, regulary. Cut a handful of EPs, but always had troubling getting everykne to focus on doing a full album (plus money, we were all broke in our 20s haha).

Except for a few months way back at the end of HS, I have been in at least one band since I was 16 (30 now). Nearly half my life, and the entirety of my adult life.

Some years ago I took on mixing and audio engineering pretty seriously, out of necessity at first, and out of love for it after a bit. I keep a small but steady flow of work in that field so it's not like being without a band removes me from working with others in music. Though it's obviously way more removed feeling.

Feels almost the same as breaking off a long term relationship. There is a sense of freedom that is neat, but more consuming is this weird lost & empty feeling.

242,Why do music schools still push going for orchestra jobs,78,154w8uj,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/154w8uj/why_do_music_schools_still_push_going_for/,93,"I (23F) have been studying music for the past five years. I'm just always taken aback how so many music schools and professors keep pushing the agenda that the only two music career options are an education job or an orchestra job, which is far from the truth, especially in 2023.

Music schools additionally keep pushing the stigma to train day and night for orchestra jobs that rarely have opportunities and openings. It is arguably the most promoted career option in music school, yet one of the worst paid positions with little to no job market.

Only 50 orchestras in the US are full-time, only 20 of those orchestras pay an annual salary of 50k or more, and the AVERAGE age to land any kind of orchestra job is 38.

To do this math, let's just say there's 3 oboe positions in an orchestra. So, that would be 60 oboe positions in the country offering an annual salary of 50k+. 1,795 institutions in the United States have degree-granting music programs. Let's just say one oboe player graduates from these colleges each year.

If someone gets an orchestra job at 38 and keeps it until retirement (67), these oboe positions only open up once every 20 years.

That is 35k people with oboe degrees over a span of 20 years. Of course, not all of these individuals are looking for an orchestra job, yet it is heavily pushed we strive for these positions that are underpaid and almost unattainable.

After I got my first full-time job in a separate passion, I just fell back in love with my instrument because the financial stress isn't there anymore.",1689871584.0

If you're just making music for fun, then don't worry about this post :)

Also! this post is mostly meant for those in instrumentalist genres (no vocals), but a lot of the principles will also apply to vocal genres.

**Why you should read what I have to say:** I've put in hundreds upon hundreds of hours into *researching and applying* how us instrumentalists and composers can gain traction in this over-saturated music world. I'm by no means amazing at marketing but I never give up and keep learning and applying, and *it is showing in my results.* I've gotten 200,000 streams in the past 9 months with no label, no promotional service, and almost no budget. *Just my music, a vision, and me.* By end of this year, I'm hoping and aiming to be around 50-100k steady monthly listeners and getting 100-300k streams a month (This factors in exponential growth. Majority of growth will always be at latter stages of an artist's career).

\---

**Bit of backstory:**

With that said, Hi there! My name is Edin Kaso and I've been playing piano and making music for almost 15 years. It's been an on-and-off hobby of mine during this long period, but recently last summer I decided I would start releasing piano compositions regularly. Now here was the problem...I'm a HUGE procrastinator, always coming up with tons of ideas but never finishing anything. So at this point last summer I had not finished ANY piano compositions (except for just one I made back in 2012 which was quite mediocre in my opinion). I did write finished music in different genres - pop, musical theatre, jazz etc, because I had to for deadlines, but I never had a deadline for any of my piano pieces...So I decided June 2022 to start putting deadlines on myself to start finishing my piano compositions and started with my first release in July 2022.

Since then I've learned so much about marketing music! It's a whole world in of itself, but I'll try to consolidate what I've learned down below.

**INTRO:**

Before we start, it's a given you're already composing decent music (the key here is *objectively* good, not subjectively). Solid composition, Solid performance and recording (If MIDI it NEEDS to sound like a real person playing the instrument), and decently mixed and mastered. **Because none of this will work if the music is not up to standard in each of these areas.** So this means you or your family and close friends' opinions cannot be considered here. You'll have to hear it from mostly strangers if possible (even on the internet). There are a lot of music reviewing websites where you can get your music reviewed. Also, just posting on the internet on places like reddit or forums etc, will tell you. Don't be afraid to ask for feedback from composers/artists/musicians you admire too (and make sure to ask for honest critique here). Just don't be too spammy!

\---

**1.** **Your #1 Goal is to gain favor with the Spotify algorithm**

Now people might say the organic route through social media and TikTok works better (posting viral content) and it definitely is! ...but the problem with instrumental genres (especially original music), is it's VERY VERY hard to gain traction compared to vocal genres. It is definitely possible, but you'd have to really nail your content down, approach, and audience (something I personally am still trying to figure out)

*You still want to use social media though because it's going to help fuel the Spotify algorithm.*

***Always remember this: Spotify is built like a social media platform. You give it good engagement and it will push out your music to more people, you give it bad engagement and it will stop promoting your music. Spotify itself will do much of the work for you in getting your music to new listeners and getting ""viral"" on Spotify.*** What this means is you DON'T want to give it tons of random engagement. Stop pitching to random playlists genres and trying to get on every single playlist. Stop sharing your music to audiences that have shown to not like or engage with it. Stop buying ""promotional services"" or botted streams or playlists (and bot streams have the worst engagement you'll ever give to the system, so you can kiss your sweet Spotify algorithm goodbye if you do this).

**What constitutes good engagement and bad engagement is fairly simple.**

**Positive:**

\- A listen (over 30 seconds of play)

\-Listening to full track, and re-listening

\-""Liking"" a song or adding to personal playlist

\-Following artist

**Negative:**

\-Skipping a song (THAT'S IT!)

You want as much positive engagement as possible, and as little negative engagement as possible. You do this by putting your music in front of audiences that will like it. Bots DO NOT count (even if they don't skip and they ""like"" your music) because Spotify has no sensical data on these fake listeners (because they're fake!) and Spotify needs real positive engagement to form YOUR ideal listener's profile. If you bot, your algorithm WILL be screwed up.

Everything we talk about below will connect back to the Spotify algorithm.

\---

**2. Importance of Playlisting for Instrumental Genres.**

Playlisting is a huge part of instrumental genres. For the majority of listeners, instrumental music doesn't tend to be in the forefront and is usually in the background while they are doing something. As it result it fits more into dedicated playlist with certain themes. The good news is many people seek out instrumental music when doing activities (studying, reading, sleeping, work, etc) and these activities make up most of people's days, which means there is a huge demand for instrumental music in these ways!

\-**Pitch to the right playlists.** Pitch to playlists in your genre and artists with similar sounds. This will give you good engagement. There are some credible and some lesser credible playlist submission sites. Make sure the playlist is not fake or botted. You can do this by using playlist analyzing sites or services. Any huge spike in follower growth or loss is a huge sign it's a fake playlist (not always the case for growth though because it could be from as shoutout from a big influencer etc... but whenever it's a loss spike, 100% run the other way. This is Spotify cleaning up all the bots in their system and it'll show in that playlist's sudden loss of followers. Hundreds of people will not suddenly unfollow a playlist all at the same time). If you can't use such a service, you can still tell by looking at playlist size (botted playlists will usually have far less tracks than non-botted ones), user profile who created playlist (if a lot of their followers have random names and letters, be wary), or if they ask for PAYMENT, this is a DEAD giveaway. Also, random genres in a playlist is concerning too.

Remember, even if you pitch to a real playlist with a mix of random genres, you're going to get a lot more skips on your track (which is bad!). So choose wisely which ones to submit to.

**-Network with playlist curators.** This is a very fundamental part of instrumental genres. Get to know the curators in your genre, and don't be spammy. Curators usually are musicians themselves too with their music on Spotify. So take an interest in their music. Also, make your own playlists and add similar artists and sounds. Work at growing your playlist followers through ads, reddit, social media, sharing, SEO. *This will not only help your own engagement, but will also help in networking with other curators.* You can add their music in your playlist and often times they'd be happy to add yours to theirs. Over time, this will keep re-enforcing good engagement for Spotify.

\---

**3. Brand awareness and targeting your ideal audience.**

**You need to know exactly who your audience is, and you can't say ""everyone"".** If you make jazz music and you promote it to K-POP listeners in their teens YOU WILL FAIL. Everyone has their tastes and preferences. Even if you were Jesus making the most heavenly music and you released to Spotify, it still unfortunately would not appeal to everyone. Find YOUR audience, and think of similar artists with existing audiences you could target. For me, it was targeting people who loved Studio Ghibli music (as a lot of people say my music is similar) and it's been doing wonders.

**Also have a clear and consistent brand and vision.** I ended up clearly developing mine only months after my first release and even have a clear aesthetic to go with it, so it doesn't happen right away...but make this one of your goals too. Now when people discover my music, they know what I'm about right away. You want clarity in your vision. So this means you can't be making jazz music and then all of a sudden making heavy metal for your next release. You WILL fail, no matter how good the music is. **Clear and consistent image is key, so when new listeners find you they know exactly what you're about.**

**Promoting live, on social media, ads.** I personally prefer not to promote live as I want to remain anonymous. But there's so many options...busking, events, streaming, etc etc (I can't say much about these since I haven't done them though). But for me what has been working is engaging with communities where my potential audience is. Discords, subreddits, social media, etc. This does not mean spamming my music, but it does mean actually talking with these ones and then when there is a rapport, then sharing my music. Also, I will occasionally share new releases when appropriate. I have experimented with reddit ads, Facebook and Instagram ads, and Spotify ads. The only good results I've experienced with is Spotify. I will say though, because I don't have much of a budget I just didn't give the other ads enough volume and data (since these are self-learning algorithms) to start to show results. For me, Spotify Marquee seems to be much better this way, since it lets you target the audience of another artist (in my case I just targeted Joe Hisaishi's audience).

**4. Building momentum and few more tips for Spotify algorithm.**

**Make sure you release regularly. Once every 4 weeks is best.** Spotify is just like a social media platform. So the more active you are and the more engaged with it's systems, the more it will prioritize in promoting you. The most important way is to release regularly. Also regularly update your bio, artist pick, add Spotify canvas, add artist playlists etc. These help too.

The two biggest ways Spotify promotes you is through algorithm playlists. You get on these playlists by giving Spotify enough *good engagement.* Release Radar is especially crucial. You can get on release radar for up to 28 days after a release, which is why I personally recommend releasing every 4 weeks. This will ensure you're always on this algorithmic playlist being pushed out to new listeners.

Release Radar gets pushed out to all your followers, but if you want it to really push out to new listeners, the first 24 hours after release is the most crucial window, and the 2nd most crucial is the first week after. *You want to give it as much positive engagement as possible within this timeframe.* Ask friends and family to listen and save. Post on social media (use smartlinks to keep track of data and CTR) right after release! Release videos of you performing etc etc. This is the main way I've been using social media, to kickstart a release's momentum and algorithm. If you do this every release, momentum WILL build for your artist profile, and **SPOTIFY ITSELF will be on your side doing A LOT of the promoting for you.**

I’m a proponent of the law of attraction. I got a book on it a decade ago and the first thing was to ask the universe for a gift, so I did.

At some point during our set, I hit a flow state deeper than any other time, where I was so deeply focused on listening to the other instruments I wasn’t even aware of my movements playing, but could hear them lining up perfectly. It almost felt like an out of body experience because it was like my conscious awareness was no longer within myself, but in perfect unison with my three band mates as we formed a single cell amoeba to move forward through the music in the physical reality we live it.

251,"Classic rock audiences can't even tell when the shows they go to have ""computer music,"" ""use autotune,"" and ""are lip-synced""",76,16oppha,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/16oppha/classic_rock_audiences_cant_even_tell_when_the/,159,"Not a musician, but my dad's friend gave him two tickets to see ""The 80s Rock Tour"" a few months ago. It was basically a ""greatest hits revue"" with Lou Gramm, John Payne (former Asia lead singer), and Steve Augeri (former Journey lead singer). My mom has no interest in concerts, so my dad gave me a ticket.

The whole car ride there, my dad's friend went on and on about how ""music these days is so fake, everything has autotune, and everyone lip syncs."" When we sat down, I heard at least 3 boomer couples echoing similar sentiments about ""computer music."" This would turn out to be extremely ironic.

At the show, all of the instrument playing seemed to be real since I heard them mess up and play weirdly out of sync a couple of times, but during choruses where the whole band sang backing vocals, there were some really embarrassing moments. I'll just share two, but holy shit there were so many.

During ""Lights,"" there were audible harmonies during the first ""whoa-oh-ohohoh"" part (probably to hide the fact that Steve was struggling massively to sing) which the band apparently missed. It was kinda funny to see the two guitar players rush back to their mics to make it look like they were singing, but they completely missed their cues and had to wait for the next ""whoa"" part. They looked pretty flustered and sheepish after that.

Then, during ""Jukebox Hero,"" which was supposed to be the climax of the entire show, Lou barely squeaked out his really high ""jukebox hero"" lines at the end, but suddenly you couldn't hear the ""jukebox hero, stars in his eyes"" backing vocals anymore even though the band was singing those words into the mics. This time, they all looked embarrassed, then suddenly the last ""stars in his eeeyyyyyeeees"" line of the whole song blared out of the speakers, which the band missed the first part of in their embarrassment. You could see them rushing to their mics again.

An extended minutes-long standing ovation and boomer screaming followed that last prerecorded line, and my dad's friend said on the way back ""see Diligent, this is real music, no fake shit here"" I tried to tell him what I saw during ""Jukebox Hero,"" but he vehemently insisted ""Lou would never allow that.""

It was funny.

Don't even get me started on the Eagles concert we saw last spring. Way more expensive and vocal and *instrument* tracks somehow even more blatantly obvious.

You post your stuff on IG, Tiktok, etc and the people who actually comment and LISTEN to it are people from all over the world who have never met you.

One theory I have is that, it has to do with some sort of “fame” mask in the sense that because your friends/acquaintances actually DO know you, it’s like, not as cool. The people who don’t actually know you have a completely UNBIASED opinion of you and maybe get that illusion of “fame” from you. Trust me I’m not famous, that’s not what I mean. I mean that like you’re mysterious. I hope that all makes sense.

Another thing is comments/likes/shares. Like even some seriously close friends I’ve had won’t take the time to support in those ways. But that random person from Russia will make a whole post about you and be SUPER supportive. Which makes me think they ACTUALLY like the music. Just like I said earlier, even the friends actually do think the music is good, and would probably actually listen to it if it wasn’t you making it.

It’s all just really interesting to me. Please share your opinions, thoughts, concerns (:",1690594077.0

I’m so sick of small local / regional acts who have a hint of success acting like they’re too cool or too important to communicate with smaller or newer artists. It’s beyond stupid and so childish. I’ve been in the scene locally on and off for like 15 years and it never fails. Some band gets big headed over landing a few cool gigs or doing really well with engagement on socials or streaming, then they start ignoring messages, acting like they’re too cool to talk to you at shows you’re supporting them on, not taking the time to promote the smaller bands at shows or online, etc. 

I’m not bitter about it or anything, but it’s so beyond disrespectful and I swear every time I’ve ever seen it the band is riding a wave of momentum that doesn’t last. My band has had big successful runs locally where we just crushed show turnout, streams, engagement, etc but we would never do that to some other band just looking to book a gig or say hi at a show. Just remember if you’re in a comfortable position and you feel like you’ve had a lot of success, you had to start near the bottom too and it’s hard. Be nice to people in other bands.

When I was roughly 18, I had just been kicked out of college and lacked purpose. I tended to find my purpose at the bottom of a bottle, whether a bottle of liquor or pills. I was in need of something and I wasn’t sure what that was. March, 2005 some friends and I were at Tybee island for the weekend, drinking partying, doing beach things. Late one night we walked out on the beach to go on the prowl for something….other night owls, fresh air. Maybe a fight. Who knows. We walked up the side step to the pier to go to the bathroom and that’s when I heard music coming from the front part of the pier near the road. I followed the sound and there sat a gentleman, case open, sitting in the bench attached to the pier, strumming a guitar. We sat for what seemed like hours and listened to him play. He informed us that he would be playing at a bar the following night and was just out busking for practice. He played a lot of 90s tunes, classic rock stuff. The song that still sticks out to me is, “Turn The Page” by Bob Seger. It was amazing! I asked the guy how long he had been playing and he told me “8 months”. 8 freakin months! Right there in that moment a lightbulb went off and I knew I was going to buy a guitar and learn to play. 

The following week was my birthday. I was turning 19. My Gf at the time bought me a cheap, shitty pawnshop guitar and proceeded to play every second of everyday. I had found my purpose. I wasn’t working as I had been kicked out of school, as I mentioned before. I’m positive I annoyed my parents to death with my beginner guitar, but I was hooked. The first song I learned was “Turn The Page” by Bob Seger, believe it or not. Quickly followed by “Let Her Cry” by Hootie and the Blowfish. Both relatively easy beginner tunes. 

This was in 2005. I was 18. It is now 2023, I am 37. I have 14 guitars, a degree in music production and a passion for music that I may have never happened upon had I not met a stranger, on a pier, in Tybee island, playing simple tunes who had only been playing guitar for 8 months.

I did theater when I was younger and though I had a lot of stage fright I still always had other people on stage with me so it’s much less scary. Not to mention my fears gotten worse so I guess I’m just asking if anyone else with bad stage fright or anxiety has any advice for playing the first time? I’ve always had this mindset of not showing people stuff until you know you’re really good and though I’m progressing, I’m not great. Also does anyone know what it might be like? I’m taking lessons at gc. Thanks.

  
Edit: Thank you to everyone who commented didn’t expect this much. A lot of very useful tips that have definitely made it seem much less scary. I have another question just in case someone sees this, i live in Wa and the music scene in the part I live In is pretty bad. I mean I don’t know much but I know there’s really not much going on here. So I was just wondering how anyone else with similar experience approached finding places to play/ open mics. Just a question for the future:)",1713393257.0

I’ve always wanted to learn guitar. A couple months ago it was like a switch went off in my brain and I picked up my dad’s old guitar and started learning some chords. I’m making my way through learning country roads. I reconnected with a singing teacher from my childhood and started a trial month of classes. I now have the choice to sign up for a year of classes and I’m not going to lie it’s not cheap. I mean it’s not cheap to learn anything. Especially if you’re trying to learn to do something with competence. I’m conflicted. Reconnecting with the music side of my life has been so nice on so many levels. I distanced myself from music for so many years for so many complicated reasons. I won’t go into it all, but distancing myself from music was influenced by religious trauma and grief. But I guess seeing the price tag made me realize how much I’m asking for. Like am I an idiot for wanting to do this for myself? Am I selfish for wanting to spend this much money on something? I feel like I’m asking for too much from my husband. I’m also worried that it will be a waste of time. My husband and I are looking to have a baby in 2024. I’m worried that once that happens will I even have the time? Will it turn out to just be a waste of money? Will I not be able to keep up with it and just toss everything to the side? Has anyone had any luck finding that balance? Even now I struggle and am not able to practice daily like I would want to. Any advice is welcome.

311,Music theory is not a set of rules. This is not a subjective opinion. It is a fact.,65,11oyvt2,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/11oyvt2/music_theory_is_not_a_set_of_rules_this_is_not_a/,15,"If you already know this, this post is not for you. I’m going to say the things that I wish someone had said when I both started studying music more formally and when I got to a point where I felt boxed in by the way it was taught.

Music theory is descriptive. It is not prescriptive. Playing non-diatonically is not against music theory. Not following some interpretation of the circle of fifths is not a violation of the circle of fifths or music theory.

Music theory is more like a language than anything else. You take the major scale and base intervals on it because you have to start somewhere. It isn’t grammatically incorrect to play something outside of your key. Jazz, blues, punk and death metal aren’t genres based around “breaking the rules of music theory”. There are no rules, only explanations and terms to describe something so that you can communicate with other musicians and recall options to try certain chords and intervals when you’re stuck about where to go next.

There are examples where theory can be used as guidelines. Say you want to play something that sounds like a certain band, or you want to understand what makes that band sound the way that it does. You can analyze that band’s music and you can do “ok so there are a lot of chromatic mediants, and they play the flat 2 a lot despite most of their music being diatonically in the standard minor scale”, and then you can apply that to either writing your own music or writing something that sounds like something they might write. Still, though, in this example, there will be plenty of examples of even that particular band “breaking its own rules”, because, again, they are no rules, and music is made by people and people crave variety, so even when they write four songs with one scale or similar scales, there will be variation, and there will like be four others on the same album that use a totally different scale.

Music theory is great. I love it. It’s something I think about a lot, but only recently did I get my head around fully understanding that its purpose is not to put is in a cage, and it isn’t about “learning the rules so that you can know when to break them”. It’s just about understanding all your options.",1678577900.0

316,Rant: I'm a longtime musician whose struggling not to hate even the very concept of music anymore,64,1bzbp8g,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1bzbp8g/rant_im_a_longtime_musician_whose_struggling_not/,231,"So I've been playing music my whole life, and guitar especially since I was in middle school. I've loved it and enjoyed it my whole life. Music has been a major part of who I am. I've played for fun, played gigs for money, played just for the sake of it, etc. I enjoy all genres, country, math rock, metal, gospel, everything. I just loved music.

Writing music has always been my favorite part of music, and composition is the main driver for why I have continued to play. I can't listen to songs without ""hearing"" new parts, so as a result I've never really listened to much music, plus I get more obsessed with whatever new earworm popped into my head. Moreover, I sing my own made up melodies in church (we do acapella only) since I can express the music I feel like should be. I can't even walk around without getting my own made up melodies stuck in my head, and the only cure has always been to learn the part on an instrument. As a result, I've made a lot of great songs, some fading into obscurity and some gaining some traction, though I only ever did it for its own sake rather than that it would be appreciated--like if a song I kept hearing against my will didn't exist and I didn't actualize it then it felt almost like the world was not right and thus I must actualize it. Music has become such apart of my life, my son's middle name is a pun for music (that I can't share since this is a throwaway).   


Lately, though, I just look at all my gear, all my skills, the time I've spent on its vanity, and I just find myself filled with disgust and resentment. I hate that I spend time playing music rather than learn a practical skill like wood working or being with my family. I hate that I am so drawn to an instrument, and I hate that I can't bring myself to rid myself of them as many were gifts. I find myself now even hating everything about the concept of melody, harmony, rhythm, the fact its intelligible, the fact it manipulates emotions for better or for worse rather than what the person genuinely feels without modification. I hate that it distracts me, I hate the fact that I can't be free of it when I sleep at night and a melody comes to me against my will. I hate that I can't go to church and worship without hearing music, that even when I try to ""shut off"" and just focus on the Lord. I hate that I can't escape the unheard melodies plaguing me as a lock up my house at night, nor can I walk around listening to a podcast without some made up sound tormenting me. I hate that I can't sit in silence in my car without an old song coming to mind, or a conversation with someone reminding me of a song I once heard and the melody embedding itself into me. I hate that I can't listen to other people's music without wanting to join in or appreciating it as it already is. I hate the idea of monetizing my music to the extent that I live off it, but I also hate the idea of not monetizing something I've spent so much time and effort refining. I hate the feeling of shame of playing instead of doing something else, and I hate the shame of feeling like I wasted my life refining a vain skill.  


I don't feel burnt out; I feel cursed. I love music, I think, but I am becoming overwhelmed with disdain and hatred for it. Honestly, I **never** want to hear another note again in my life again, questioning if I would be happier deaf, but I also shudder at the idea as I doubt I could escape my curse of creativity.",1712615636.0

I am also being told that 'Monarch' and its regal connotations are just not suitable for someone like myself, who is.. well.. not royal.

I can see their concern (and I appreciate it), however I can't help but feel like they're overblowing the issue. If people like my music, surely they can look past a name?

Music Generators. He's not a musician at all - he can come up with some decent melodies sometimes vocally, but can't sing or play an instrument to save his life. He knows I've personally been writing and performing music seriously for the last 20+ years - I'm not even that great at it, but I've worked hard, and I love music as a release and a hangout with my band members.

I get it, this A.I. stuff is going to be part of our world for the forseeable future, so do what makes you happy in your own home. The problem I have is, he's sending me (bragging about) all of these A.I. songs via DM and I don't know how to respond. I'm kinda just like, ""Cool man, technology is pretty neat"", and leave it at that, pretty much ignore the rest of his messages rambling about how hard he worked on these songs of his. He's a really insecure dude, so saying something shitty to him would probably set him off bigtime.

Look, the songs are just horrible, as you could probably understand. Not even that it's not my style of music, but just has that lifeless, robotic, generic sound. He plans on releasing dozens of these songs ASAP.  I'm still OK with this, I can ignore him for the most part.

Now he's turning this into a whole ""project"". He has new artwork, press releases, and even merch...all from A.I. Generators. Not a single ounce of effort other than pressing a few keystrokes. He's on top of the world in his mind making this fake music and blasting it all over his socials as the next big thing that's going to revolutionize the music industry. I could post some of the PR, it would make you gag. People are lifting him up saying how proud they are of him and his brilliant efforts (non-musicians, I'm sure).  My friends and I are sitting here like, hmmmm, really?

Am I being petty about this? Should I even care? I'm not losing sleep over it, but I don't know how to gently let him know that it's pretty damn annoying that I'm out here creating multiple times a week and he's pumping this garbage out with the click of a button. I'll probably just let it fizzle out, though.

Maybe I just needed to air it out and see if anyone here is dealing with a similar thing in their world.

EDIT: Thanks for all the great suggestions and experiences.I've gotten a handful of requests to hear the A.I. songs. I figured at this point it would be OK to upload the songs anonymously to a public Dropbox and Google link if you're curious and want to hear what these sound like. (I'm kinda new to Reddit, so I don't know of there's a better file server I should use).

It's a bunch of songs in one file so you'll have to skip around. You'll get the idea. Obviously some quality loss from downloading from Youtube to MP3, etc.

I just need to hear that I am not crazy and alone because, although I acknowledge there is some talent and good things in these artists' music, what is it that is “so good” that they rule the music industry? I look at any other era, and I see better pop artists and much better themes in their songs. The theme nowadays is apparently the “sad girl music.” Now people will tell me I am misogynistic, but I am a woman too, and I don't have to necessarily enjoy this much of a girly concept. This does not mean I don't support equality in the music industry for women. In fact, it's nice to see many women at the top, but as an independent musician, seeing the same names promoted is frustrating. People now call Taylor Swift the “music industry” itself and enjoy this. Don't they see this is not a good thing for providing equal opportunities to musicians? People tell me Swift is an excellent songwriter. I cannot see it though? Is writing the same chord progression all over again with auto-tuned vocals and not showcasing any instrumental genius considered as good songwriting nowadays? I like John Mayer's songwriting or Jose Gonzalez or Steve Lukather. They use some interesting chord progressions and lyricism. Also, I feel like there is an aggressiveness in these music's fans. They do not want to accept someone might not like it. They try to dominate the trend and thats why her camapaign was so successful.The music actually reflects all of these peoples personality. It is always about a girl who thinks she is right and everyone is wrong. What's wrong with the new society? Can we please be better and try to appreciate more indie artists instead of religiously supporting mediocre pop music without meaning? I know I will get lots of hate for this post and my frustration might have blinded my view in some points like generalizing so much or overseeing some good songs billie and rodrigo has but this whole thing just doesnt look like its going for better.",1701650272.0

They hated that. And told me I was ""ruining the market"".

373,Yes! You should use your gift!,59,18ofrci,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/18ofrci/yes_you_should_use_your_gift/,34,"I see a lot of posts here about musicians wondering if they should just give it all up and stop making music. There are a few reasons for their angst, and many are well founded, and I see where they are coming from. But let me just add my two cents worth by stating the obvious truth:

You have a gift, the ability to play and create music. Never let that part of you go.

I know that sounds easier to said than done when it seems like no one is listening, you have no online followers, you're broke and need to get a paying job, etc. But that misses the point: you have the ability to make music and fill the world with beautiful sounds. So you should even if it seems it's just for your own pleasure. You love music so much you took the time to learn an instrument, and you love it so much that you're having a crisis about not doing it.

Ever since I was a young kid, I was making up poems and songs. I decided I wanted to be a ""real poet"", got an MFA and tried to get published in literary mags. So I spent quite a few years submitting to everywhere I could, only to pile up rejection letters. At some point I realized that I vastly enjoyed doing poetry readings instead of banging my head against the wall trying to get published in a magazine with less than a thousand subscribers. I've read in front of some big crowds, and as people came up to tell me they liked my poetry, those dreams of little magazines just faded away. I also altered the dream by leaving my part time college teaching to get a full time job teaching high school English and coaching football.

I also started playing guitar in my early twenties, a little over thirty years ago, mainly to play three songs: Tangled up in Blue, Melissa, and Eyes of the World. I am the original Uncle Strummy, and for about 15 of those years I was a less than mediocre fire pit singer. But it was so much fun. Soon my guitar playing got good enough to create original music, and there was the joyful confluence of my two dream streams, poetry and guitars. Now I play in a couple bands with sporadic small crowd gigs, and am having the time of my life in my late fifties. It's absolutely worth the work and the wait to be able to play music. 90% of the music I play is out on my picnic table under a wild cherry with only the birds, cats and assorted varmints as an audience. But it is my joy just to play and have my music be part of the Great Stream of Music.

Don't give up your gift because you struggle with your own version of success. Art is struggle sometimes. And often it's the struggle that leads you to a deeper understanding of your gift. Remember that we've only had recorded music, and the fame and fortune it brings, for a little over a hundred years. Before that, most every musician was fairly anonymous, except for some famous composers. They played for small crowds and at best had a local notoriety. I mean, who was the best harpist of the 13th century? How much money did that virtuoso lute player who could shred make in the Court of King Arthur?

Don't give up your gift! The world needs you to create beauty and joy with your music. Be part of the Great Stream, even if it's only you and some yard varmints.",1703254146.0

(Or drums or whatever your instrument is, I'm just picking on guitarists because I am one and they're most likely to also be the singers) Like not to be a douche but no one in the audience is gonna hear the difference between a squier and a fender, but they will notice if they can't hear you singing or the PA is squealing. I'm just saying it's priorities. Buy yourself whatever super expensive nice gear you want, but maybe put some thought into what is actually going to translate into the best experience for your audience.

I knew I didn't do well, my videos are far from flawless. And I know I'm the one to blame.

I always start so late with everything, not just with this audition; but in the past I always start practising my repertoire intensely only a few weeks before a recital/performance/exam. I'm crying my eyes out. I don't know why I'm like this, I feel like I'm just screwing myself over and over. Maybe I just don't have the discipline and talent to be a competent classical musician?

I have been reading rejection posts online, and I see a lot of comments saying 'if it's your dream/passion, don't give up!' honestly, at this point I don't even know if music is my passion anymore, or has it ever been? Sometimes I think maybe I identify myself so strongly as a classical musician only because I'm pretty much useless without my instrument. I have never worked a 'normal' job in my life, and I don't know anything other than music (and classical music is the only genre I'm familiar with anyway). I have imagined myself having a different career, a more 'real-world' one, but then I get the feeling that I'd rather be dead.

I think I wouldn't have taken the rejection so hard if I was younger, but I'm turning 25 soon (The audition was for a masters programme) and I feel like I'm running out of time. I feel absolutely useless because I have achieved nothing. I feel sick thinking about auditioning for a different school not because I don't want to try again but long-hour practice sessions are starting to feel like a privilege. And even if I get in, I would be approaching my late 20s...

I feel so stuck, and my mental and physical health are also going downhill...I feel so ashamed and like I have failed my teachers and family.",1644845382.0

I just wanted to share how my first gig went. I’m lead guitar in a metal band and we released our first single almost a year ago followed up with 4 other singles since then. We’ve held off doing a gig as we wanted to get as polished as we could and utilise in-ear monitoring which has taken a bit to setup. The longer we put it off though, the more nervous and in my head I got about it. 

I had two guitar solos to play, one of which is very hard and I can only play to about 50-80% accuracy each time I practice 

Well we hit the stage last night in an opening slot to about 70 people and had an amazing time! Myself and another member were counting the minutes and getting really (good) nervous as the minutes passed. We played really well, kept on time, I nailed my two guitar solos, and all and all had a great time. The crowd were singing along and some strangers were throwing down at the front!

Which is another thing to consider, because despite their touting they have publishing deals to allow tabs, it seems the opposite is the truth. **They are allowed to operate because being in Russia allows them to ignore royalties and publishing rights.** I'll quote from an article in the New York Times:

""Doug Osborn, an executive vice president with Ultimate-Guitar.com said his site violated no laws because its headquarters were in Russia, and the site’s practices complied with Russian laws.""

https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/technology/21ecom.html

I've been vocal in the past about UG and it's poor practices. I think it's time that we as a community came together, even if it's just some small part, and stop using UG.

Edit: I bolded the part musicians need to understand. No matter what you think about the war Russia wages with Ukraine, UG resides in Russia to order to break copyright law. And screw over musicians.",1647111599.0

# 1. Practice your songs to a click

Unless you are recording a LIVE album, practicing your music to a metronome makes overdubbing or any sort of correction in **Post-Production** incredibly easy. I know many engineers that will not record without a click simply to avoid the headache. If your musical group has music (*or a drummer*) that fluctuates between tempos, you need to rehearse the music to per-determined **BPM** before showing up to your session.

# 2. Show up Prepared

My opinion is: A great studio session is one that runs quickly and efficiently. If you and your band mates are pressured into last minute problems or troubleshooting (*such as vocal delivery, guitar melody, or rhythm section misalignment*), it can be a real strain on the recording process.

If you are looking to become a session musician, remember this saying: ***You might not be the best player in the room, but you can certainly be the most prepared.***

# 3. Recording a Song is like building a house

Before you even get to work on the house, you spend hours designing and planning. This is the **Pre-Production Phase**. Finally, you are ready to bring a construction crew to your site of choice… This is your arrival at the Studio. You put down the foundations first, within the context of the greater plan of the house. This is why drums and bass are the first to record, within the context of a scratch guitar or melody track. Next, you put up walls and a roof, essentially closing off the creative box in which you will work. This is the main identifying characteristic of the song (or house), such as lead melodies and vocals, or lead guitar. From there, you add finishing touches — nice railings on the stairs, windows, drywall, insulation, and paint. These are finer details that reinforce the greater creative goal of the song, such as vocal harmonies, horn lines, solo sections, time-based effects, percussion, and texture.

### From my experience, I like to organize my **Recording Process** like this:

1. **Drums + Bass**
2. **Pad** (Rhythm Guitar + Keys) — OR
3. **Melody** (Vocals, guitar, keys, whichever instrument is playing the melody)
4. **Harmony** (Horn section, backing vocals, etc)
5. **Texture** (ambience, percussion, overdubs)

And then of course at any time, any and all of these elements can be re-recorded (*exception here:* ***drums***), edited, moved around, spliced, played backwards, etc.

# 4. You can always add reverb and delay, but it is impossible to get rid of.

Most likely, your mix engineer will add reverb and delay properly. However, some artists are adamant that they know best:

### Scenario 1:

Let’s say you are in a Dream Pop band that has vocals running through a highly saturated vocal effects pedal. Your singer absolutely nails the take of the chorus, except for one thing: the singer accidentally smacks the microphone with their hand because of their \*sick dance moves\*. If you are only recording the vocal signal **wet** (*with effects*) as opposed to **dry** (*without effects*), not only are you recording the physical smack of the microphone, but you also are recording the 2 seconds of reverb that comes after. If you recorded Dry, you can easily edit out the hit and saturate the dry vocals with effects in Post. But if you recorded Wet, this becomes a brutal challenge for even the best engineer.

Mixing Engineers agree that it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove any amount of reverb or delay on a recorded instrument. Which is why we record dry signals and send the performer a wet signal in their monitor mixes. We make separate tracks for important, time-based effects like reverb and delay, and give those effects their own adjustable levels and parameters for real-time monitoring without affecting the integrity of the dry vocal track.

### Scenario 2:

You are the keyboard player of an indie rock band and you are playing a Rhodes. The built in tape delay on your Korg SV1 Keyboard is pretty great! So, you slap it on. Turns out, your delay timing is too long and too prominent in the context of the mix. Unfortunately, in this scenario there is nothing the engineer can do to fix that. ***With any and all time-based effects, you want to start small and build big, or use none at all***. You can always re-amp the clean signal or re-record the instrument with effects to taste.

# 5. Re-amp your guitars for the perfect tone

### Scenario 3:

You are in a Heavy Metal Band. Your guitar player take a 4 bar solo before the Pre-Chorus Breakdown. The amount of Gain and Distortion on this solo must be absolutely Perfect — and while your effects may be incredibly dialed in to your ear, the Engineer always has a different perspective. So the Engineer will split the recording process into two parts:

**Re-Amping** is a non-destructive process of recording a clean tone (usually through a DI box straight from the Guitar) and then re-recording that clean signal into a guitar amp & Pedal effects separately over top of the song at a later time. This gives the band and Engineer the opportunity to fine-tune the gain, distortion, compression and any other effects to perfection without compromising the initial take.

[DI Box](https://i.imgur.com/Fmr88Jt.jpg)

Many engineers split the initial guitar tone and record both a **wet** & **dry** signal, especially in genres of heavily affected guitars (*like Metal, Rock and Roll, Pop, & Psychedelic Rock*). All musicians hold a bias towards the sound of their instrument as it appears to them *while they play*. Which is why when a guitarist hears their own wet take played side by side in context of the full mix, they many times choose the engineer’s.

# 6. Understand the Concept of the “Mix Space”

1. ***Kick Drum*** — center bottom
2. ***Snare*** — lower center, left side
3. ***Cymbals*** — Shimmering over top, spread wide
4. ***Pad*** — fills in the stereo image
5. ***Lead melody*** — loud and proud, center center
6. ***Rhythm guitar*** — center, panned appropriately
7. ***Bass*** — sandwiched between the Kick Drum Low and High

# 7. Make a recording schedule

What days do we do this? What days do we do that? Making a schedule allows you to keep track of your timeline and your budget!

It also helps to keep the recording engineer prepared. Here’s an example:

1. Wednesday = Load In, Set up
2. Thursday = Drums, Bass, Rhythm Section
3. Friday = Vocals, Melody
4. Saturday = Solo Sections, Re-Amping
5. Sunday = Textures, ambience, transitions, finishing touches

# 8. Agree on who wrote the song.

This is important for two reasons — 1. Publishing rights (who takes credit and royalties for the intellectual property of the songwriting) and 2. Who has final say on any creative and technical decisions in the studio, on that song. Knowing who wrote the song will help the Engineer appropriately direct questions and concerns in a 1 on 1 style, instead of towards the whole band (which can lead to time-consuming debate.) This is not a huge deal, but I personally like to be aware of the creative dynamic of whose input is more valuable than others. I’m really only adding this because part of being a recording engineer is working within the dynamic of a group of creative individuals, and you don’t want to accidentally disturb it. And I’ve seen some arguments for sure… moving on.

# 9. No family members or friends while tracking

Please leave your parents and siblings at home. I generally welcome significant others (*because spouses/partners of professional musicians “get it”*) but if your companions in the studio are distracting an engineer while they are working (*or worse, distracting the musician while you are working*), the Engineer might ask them to leave…. its not vacation time for your Engineer. Its ***get-work-done-time***.

# 10 Leave the Drama (and the drugs) at the Door

As a general rule, keep your distractions away from the Engineer. Recording is a very stressful and methodical task. If you’ve got a joint, take it outside. If you’ve got beef with a band mate…

[Yeah, thats gonna be a no from me, dawg](https://i.imgur.com/7ZF9HxL.png)

# 11. Don’t steal our Gaff tape, that stuff is expensive.

\*guilty\*

# 12. Most performance-related flaws can be fixed in post

Miss a note on the solo? **Edit it in post.** Vocalist didn’t deliver that line quite right? **Don’t worry, there’s 12 other takes**. Not enough Reverb? **I Give it the ole’ Re-Amp treatment.** Kick drum is off beat? **Copy, Paste, baby!** Efficiency is the name of the game in the recording process.

*(also, click* [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrXfK9Osmvs) *if you don't understand the Troggs reference below.... GOLD)*

[The Troggs](https://i.imgur.com/wLu0tiv.jpg)

# 13. However, two things must be addressed immediately: Time and Pitch

This is an objective issue that can foil the recording process. If your engineer tells you that you are either: **Rushing/Dragging** or **Out of Tune**, be cognizant that this small flaw can jeopardize the track later in the Recording Process (when *you add elements like harmony, melody, and texture*).

Which leads nicely into the next tip:

# 14. Tune your instruments in between takes

Please bring a tuner to the session. In general, you should be ultra-aware of your tempo (*if you are a member of the rhythm section*) and your tuning/intonation (*if you are a member of the melody section*).

# 15. Do some exercise/stretches in between takes

This is really important — Exercising in between takes can significantly increase everyone’s mood and energy going back into the studio. You can actually hear the difference in the takes. Not to mention it can help relieve all that stress and any pent up aggression you have towards your band mates. Not only is exercise good for not having a heart attack when you are 50, it’ll actually make the recording process much smoother and make the takes themselves better (*in my opinion*).

[Relevant BoJack is Relevant](https://i.imgur.com/JEKZZed.png)

# 16. Show up prepared… to wait

1. 75% of your time will be spent sitting and waiting, or listening to your band mates record, so bring something to keep you occupied but that won’t take you out of the zone. I recommend a video game that you love but that is also something that you can put down in an instant and that you aren’t really invested in. Something simple, like Mario Kart or Super Smash Brothers, or even a Pokémon game.
2. If you want to stay in a creative vibe, I recommend bringing something to draw or doodle with. Put on some headphones and go dance outside. (We have a Rubix cube that sees a lot of love)
3. The most important thing is not to bring something that will remove you from the mindset of the studio environment. I certainly do not recommend bringing your day job! I’ve heard many times: “I’ll just bring my computer and knock out some emails for my Marketing job while I wait for everyone to finish tracking”. This is a bad idea — it will remove you from the headspace that you, the creative artist, need to be in to make the most out of your time and your engineer’s time. Unless it is related to the Band (*ordering merchandise, responding to Promoters, confirming show details*, *etc*), I would leave it at home.

# 17. Beware of Burrito-itis

Pretty self-explanatory.

# 18. Hot tea makes a good coffee substitute for long recording sessions, but water is even better.

Staying Hydrated is super important, it’ll keep you focused for the longer sessions, not to mention being hydrated is just awesome in general. Also, make sure your vocalist knows about **Throat Coat**, that stuff is the mamma-jammas

[Throat Coat](https://i.imgur.com/lhtmVV0.jpg)

# 19. The engineer is not your enemy

The Recording Engineer has one job: ***Be the bridge that transfers the highest quality version of your music into the physical world***. This manifests itself differently from producer to producer… some engineers are technical producers and some engineers are people producers. It’s a balance of therapy and tough love, tech savvy & emotional capacity, having the mental fortitude to keep going and the discipline to know when you’ve gone far enough. The bottom line — The Engineer is just doing what they believe is the best thing for the final product. So if your engineer delivers constructive criticism to you, such as “*That take was a decent take, but I can hear the energy level dropping a bit. Let’s take 15 and regroup*”… don’t take it personally.

# 20. Bring your A-Game

Aside from the mental discipline needed for an efficient and productive studio session, I argue that every musician should take their instrument to the shop to get “tuned-up” before you begin your session.

1. **Guitarists**: a tune-up can address problems such as: Buzzing frets, Intonation problems, and Electrical noise, and will usually set you up with a set of fresh strings
2. **Vocalists**: Don’t go partying the night before and lose your voice plz & thx — signed, everyone.
3. **Drummers**: Put on new heads before the session and tune your drums every couple hours. Double check the chains on your kick and hi-hat pedals.
4. **Producers**: Check that all your cables, sound cards, interfaces, controllers and adapters are working before coming into the studio. We may not have what you need!
5. **Everyone else**: Don’t make fun of the drummer for tuning their kit, just be proud that they showed up at all (kidding :P)

# 21. The #1 goal should be capturing the energy of the performance

There is an indescribable rush of emotion and power that arises from well-performed and recorded music. It’s like tasting your mom’s signature dish, or watching a group of fighter jets dance in the skies. Where just for a moment, you forget about all the technical barriers and frustrations and troubleshooting… you forget to monitor the faders on your console or the dB levels on your mic pre-amps… and you sit back in awe at the musical masterpiece crafted in front of you. And you look down at your computer screen and watch with a smile as that energy is grasped from the ephemeral and poured like concrete into your hard drive. It’s the absolute best part about being an engineer — Capturing the joy and energy and… well, the magic.

# 22. Don’t suck, Have fun

I’m gonna get a tattoo of this one day.

The day after our first post about it, the club emails us and says they’ve been informed about allegations against my band mate, and will no longer be allowing our band to play. I was blindsided, I had no clue about any of this. My band mate informs me that a few years ago, while he was involved in another group, that he was having sex with a woman who had a boyfriend. The boyfriend found out one way or another, and my band mate claims that to save face, she accused him of assault. The rest of the group took her side, and he resigned his position. 

Now I’ve known this dude half my life. I just can’t fathom him doing anything remotely related to sexual assault, but I also struggle with accepting that someone would lie about something so serious, although I know that’s happened. There’s no evidence in either direction other than the word of both parties, and I’m still vague on some things, including the exact nature of the allegations.

After living in my current place for a few years, a professional classical guitarist moved downstairs. He plays guitar very loudly for up to 6-8 hours (on and off) a day. He is quite successful in his field, as I can tell from his socials (60k followers, regular engagement, regularly traveling the world to perform). 

Unfortunately, it's driving me crazy. I understand that he needs to practice, and I am glad he has a space to do it. But given that it's a residential area where he knows he shares walls on all sides, and he's a successful musician, I'm very surprised that he doesn't have a studio or place to practice that is less disruptive to his neighbors. It's been a few years now, and I was hoping that I would get used to it, but I just can't. I often have to leave the house at odd hours to walk around just to get some silence. He recently went on vacation and I immediately felt a massive sense of relief and comfort in my own home again. Now that he's back, I am more on edge than ever.

Music is medicine. It can be used to treat diseases of the mind. If it has ever brought you a feeling of peace, relief, or well-being, it is because you needed medicine and got it. 

Some of us, through accident of birth or tragedy of circumstance, have great difficulty managing the internal experiences of being human that the majority of people are able to take for granted. We gravitate toward music because it is an effective medicine for our ailments. 

Practicing music changes you. It alters the way your mind processes daily experience. The effects are cumulative and overwhelmingly positive. Given time, dedication, and effort, the relationship a person can make with music is as enriching and life-affirming as one with a beloved person. Time makes this bond stronger, and the galvanizing effects on the mind increase. 

The bond can be broken. A diseased mind is a formidable thing, and depression wants to live. Depression recognizes music as a threat to its existence, and will conspire to come between you. 

I'm trying to find my point. I think it's that people need to recognize that for the legions of people who suffer from one mental illness or another, music and musicianship aren't necessarily hobbies. It isn't like playing a video game or sailing a boat (wonderful activities that I also love and respect). For some of us, music is an essential medicine. Neglecting our treatments can be disasterous. 

My depression simply outsmarted me. It convinced me that I was wasting my time with music. That my children would be better served by a couple of trips to the ice cream store than having a father who owns an instrument. So I sold it. I sold it all. Everything I valued that no one else would miss. Didn't even count the money I got for it. This was a symbolic but effective ritual of bond breaking. It was such a pointless, hurtful, self destructive act that I walked away from it feeling like a different person entirely. 

I do not know, recognize, or like this new person. He isn't a musician. I don't what he is, just that he has no music in him. The implications of this disturb me greatly. 

Hold on to your music. Doubts and frustrations are normal, but if you need your music to live, that is a real thing and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The increased emotional functionality that comes with the stimulation of a brain by music is as real, studied, and scientifically understood as that of antidepressants. Cutting oneself off from music can be as dangerous as going cold turkey on an antidepressant. I fucked around and I found out. Don't fuck around because it's not worth finding out. ",1694410177.0

I’ll try to keep this relatively short, I was in a band for around 4 years as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. In that time I had written a few songs for the band, like most of the lyrics, the guitar/vocal melody and structure of the whole song. 

Due to some very persistent creative differences and character conflicts, I decided to leave the band a few months ago, and before I did I made sure to ask each member if they were cool with me taking my songs and only what I wrote for them (so no taking their parts or anything) and they all said they were fine with it. Now I’m solo, and the 3 of them formed a new band.

Cut to now, I just finished recording my version of one of the songs we had worked on, different parts but it still kept the og Weezer/Midwest emo vibe I originally went for, and I hear from my ex lead guitarist that they are very unhappy that I am still using the songs. So I message them with a file of the mix, and after a few hours they finally tell me that they feel like all their stuff has been erased, notably, my ex drummer told me to just forget my songs and move on because they’re too intertwined, even if not the same exact parts. 

So that’s the impasse; When I wrote the songs I didn’t just intend to play them for a while and then forget they exist. If my ex rhythm guitarist never told me, I would’ve just assumed they were still fine. They know that I have full proof that the songs are mine, but I straight up just don’t know what to do, anybody ever had a similar situation?

# 1. Practice your songs to a click

Unless you are recording a LIVE album, practicing and your music to a metronome is essential for the studio environment. Drum takes that are “on-the-grid” makes overdubbing or any sort of correction in **Post-Production** incredibly easy. I know many engineers that will not record without a click simply to avoid the headache. If your musical group has music (*or a drummer*) that fluctuates between tempos, you need to rehearse the music to per-determined **BPM** before showing up to your session.

# 2. Show up Prepared

My opinion is: A great studio session is one that runs quickly and efficiently. If you and your band mates are pressured into last minute songwriting issues or troubleshooting (*such as vocal delivery, guitar melody, or rhythm section misalignment*), it can be a real strain on the recording process.

If you are looking to become a session musician, remember this saying: ***You might not be the best player in the room, but you can certainly be the most prepared.***

# 3. Take Your Time

The **Recording Process** is broken down into 3 parts:

## Pre-Production:

Before you even arrive at the studio, you are going to spend hours designing and planning your session. This is the **Pre-Production Phase**.  This process includes finding and communicating with your engineer about the expectations of the record and your budget. Some studios will want to do a day of Pre-Production in the studio to make sure that when it’s time to record final takes, every detail is hashed out. During this time you can put down the foundations of the song and provide context for the greater plan of the song. Foundational elements include final BPM, rhythms, instrumentation, and structure, as well as lyrics, chorus melody, lead lines, etc

## Recording

-  ***Scratch Tracks*** (guitar, vocals, melody, piano, etc)
- ***Drums + Final***
- ***Lead Instruments*** (Vocals, guitar, keys, whichever instrument is playing the melody)
- ***Pads*** (Rhythm Guitar + Keys)
- ***Harmony*** (Horn section, backing vocals, etc)
- ***Texture*** (ambiance, percussion, overdubs, Solos)

Now that the foundation is established, it is time to start building some walls! Drums and Bass will be the first 2 instruments to record final takes. The reason for this is that every other instrument needs to record along with the drums for a cohesive recording. Bass will record next to establish structure, changes, and rhythm. 

Now that these two rhythmic elements have been finalized, the rest can flow in accordance with the needs of the session and the genre. Hip hop groups would go ahead and record final takes for verses and choruses, while rock bands may elect to do guitars at this stage. In all cases, the next step is to record the main identifying characteristic of the song. After that, you add finishing touches — finer details that reinforce the greater creative goal of the song, such as vocal harmonies, horn lines, solo sections, time-based effects, percussion, and texture.

## Production

- **Time Based inserts** (Reverb & Delay) 
- **Gain Based Inserts** (Drive, Saturation, Compression) 
- **EQ**
- **Mixing** (Panning, Fade In/Outs, levelling, etc)

The production stage is often referred to as the mixing stage. Many engineers do not want the artist in the same room as them while they do the majority of the mixing as it is a tedious and focus intensive process. However, you will have many opportunities to provide detailed feedback on the mixes during the “Revisions” process. Make sure you have communicated your expectations about the mixing with your engineer and your budget before you et started in the studio!

If you have the budget, or you are working with a dedicated producer on the song, you may have the freedom to do what I call creative mixing. Creative Mixing is taking a more intensive, creative approach to the production process. It can push your track to the next level, however it is very time consuming. Creative Mix techniques include: Delay throws, risers, vocal effects, practical effects, automated effects, drum triggers, amp simulation, and so, so much more. Just make sure you work with your engineer and give them a heads up that you want to do creative mixing because it really does take a ton of time… speaking of mixing:

# 4. No time-based effects while recording!

You can always add reverb and delay, but it is impossible to get rid of when recorded. Most likely, your mix engineer will add an amount of reverb and delay appropriate for your personal mixes while **tracking** (recording) to assist the performance. However, some artists are adamant that they know best and go into the studio with the intention of breaking this rule. Let's look at some scenarios:

### Scenario 1:

Let’s say you are in a Dream Pop band that has vocals running through a highly saturated vocal effects pedal. Your singer nails a take of the chorus, except for one thing: they accidentally smack the microphone with their hand because of their \*sick dance moves\*. If you are only recording the vocal signal **wet** (*with effects*) as opposed to **dry** (*without effects*), not only are you recording the physical smack of the microphone, but you also are recording the 2 seconds of reverb that comes after. If you recorded Dry, you can easily edit out the hit and saturate the dry vocals with effects in Post. But if you recorded Wet, this becomes a brutal challenge for even the best engineer.

Mixing Engineers agree that it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove any amount of reverb or delay on a recorded instrument. Which is why we record dry signals and send the performer a wet signal in their monitor mixes. We make separate tracks for important, time-based effects like reverb and delay, and give those effects their own adjustable levels and parameters for real-time monitoring without affecting the integrity of the dry vocal track.

### Scenario 2:

You are the keyboard player of an indie rock band and you are playing Rhodes. The built-in tape delay on your Korg SV1 Keyboard is pretty great! So, you slap it on. Turns out, your delay timing is too long and too prominent in the context of the mix. Everytime you play a chord, your delay triggers half a second too late. It is unsettling and it throws off the rhythm section for the entire mix. Unfortunately, in this scenario there is nothing the engineer can do to fix that because the tape delay is recorded on the main signal. 

***With any and all time-based effects, you want to start small and build big, or use none at all***. You can always re-amp the clean signal or re-record the instrument with effects to taste:

# 5. Find your perfect Tone in Post-Production

### Scenario 3:

You are in a Heavy Metal Band. Your guitar player take a 4 bar solo before the Pre-Chorus Breakdown. The amount of Gain and Distortion on this solo must be absolutely Perfect — and while your effects may be dialed in to your ear, the Engineer always has a different perspective. So the Engineer will split the recording process into two parts:

**Re-Amping** is a non-destructive process of recording a clean tone (usually through a DI box straight from the Guitar) and then re-recording that clean signal into a guitar amp & Pedal effects separately over top of the song at a later time. This gives the band and Engineer the opportunity to fine-tune the gain, distortion, compression and any other effects to perfection without compromising the initial take.

[DI Box](https://i.imgur.com/Fmr88Jt.jpg)

Many engineers split the initial guitar tone and record both a **wet** & **dry** signal, especially in genres of heavily affected guitars (*like Metal, Rock and Roll, Pop, & Psychedelic Rock*). All musicians hold a bias towards the sound of their instrument as it appears to them *while they play*. Which is why when a guitarist hears their own wet take played side by side in context of the full mix, they many times choose the engineer’s.

# 6. Understand your position within the “Mix Space”

For many people, the first time hearing playback of yourself or your music on dedicated studio speakers in a sound-treated room is a shock. For our entire lives, we perceive music through “colored” stereo systems, as most consumer brand stereos adjust the audio that passes through them. Car Speakers, home stereos, Bose and JBL battery powered speakers, listening to music on your phone, through apple air pods, or Beats by Dre. The sonic characteristics are being changed and warped as the audio runs through each of these systems. Dedicated studio speakers, however, are designed to be *flat*, which means they add extra no characteristics to the audio source while amplifying it. The sound of studio speakers, or monitors as they are called (because they allow an engineer to *“monitor”* the audio in real time), can be off-putting or even described as harsh. The ears of the average listener are not accustomed to hearing the exposed and highly detailed audio of professional studio monitors. Our ears enjoy the warm and smooth sounds of a Bose or a JBL system, but for an engineer it is absolutely critical to working with the most accurate representation of the recorded audio, so that later in the mixing and production process of your music it will better translate into those other systems. 

Audio is energy in the form of sound waves. The **Mix Space** is a representation of how that audio (energy) occupies a room. It can be represented in a 2-D graph ( [like this one](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0970/0050/files/Seperation_In_The_Mix.jpg?v=1526997772) ) which helps us to understand the role of each instrument within a mix. 

The mix space is based on a few different parameters: Panning (Left, Center, Right), EQ (frequency spectrum, or ""height"" in a 2D representation), & Volume (gain based inserts, levels, depth). So if were to refer to an instrument (such as the kick), I would refer to that as being ""low"" on the frequency spectrum, and centered in the mix space (no pan)


Here are some examples of how different instruments sit in the mix:

1. ***Kick Drum*** — center bottom
2. ***Snare*** — lower center, left side
3. ***Cymbals*** — Shimmering over top, spread wide
4. ***Pad*** — fills in the stereo image
5. ***Lead melody*** — loud and proud, center center
6. ***Rhythm guitar*** — center, panned appropriately
7. ***Bass*** — sandwiched between the Kick Drum Low and High

Here is another graphic visualizer of a Mix Space. Hopefully this will help you make creative decisions about your music and your own parts by having a more cohesive understanding of the elements of a final mix.

# 7. Make a recording schedule

What days do we do this? What days do we do that? Making a schedule allows you to keep track of your timeline and your budget!

It also helps to keep the recording engineer prepared. Here’s an example:

- Monday = Pre-Production Day 1
- Tuesday = Pre-Production Day 2
- Wednesday = Load In, Set up
- Thursday = Drums, Bass, Rhythm Section
- Friday = Vocals, Melody
- Saturday = Solo Sections, Re-Amping
- Sunday = Textures, ambience, transitions, finishing touches

# 8. Agree on who wrote the song.

This is important for two reasons — 1. Publishing rights (who takes credit and royalties for the intellectual property of the songwriting) and 2. Who has final say on any creative and technical decisions in the studio, on that song. Knowing who wrote the song will help the Engineer appropriately direct questions and concerns in a 1 on 1 style, instead of towards the whole band (which can lead to time-consuming debate.) This is not a huge deal, but I personally like to be aware of the creative dynamic of whose input is more valuable than others. I’m really only adding this because part of being a recording engineer is working within the dynamic of a group of creative individuals, and you don’t want to accidentally disturb it. And I’ve seen some arguments for sure… moving on.

# 9. No family members or friends while tracking

Please leave your parents and siblings at home. I generally welcome significant others (*because spouses/partners of professional musicians “get it”*) but if your companions in the studio are distracting an engineer while they are working (*or worse, distracting the musician while you are working*), the Engineer might ask them to leave…. its not vacation time for your Engineer. Its ***get-work-done-time***.

# 10 Leave the Drama (and the drugs) at the Door

As a general rule, keep your distractions away from the Engineer. Recording is a very stressful and methodical task. If you’ve got a joint, take it outside. If you’ve got beef with a band mate…

[Yeah, thats gonna be a no from me, dawg](https://i.imgur.com/7ZF9HxL.png)

# 11. Don’t steal our Gaff tape, that stuff is expensive.

\*guilty\*

# 12. Most performance-related flaws can be fixed in post

Miss a note on the solo? **Edit it in post.** Vocalist didn’t deliver that line quite right? **Don’t worry, there’s 12 other takes**. Not enough Reverb? **I Give it the ole’ Re-Amp treatment.** Kick drum is off beat? **Copy, Paste, baby!** Efficiency is the name of the game in the recording process.

*(also, click* [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrXfK9Osmvs) *if you don't understand the Troggs reference below.... GOLD)*

[The Troggs](https://i.imgur.com/wLu0tiv.jpg)

# 13. However, two things must be addressed immediately: Time and Pitch

This is an objective issue that can foil the recording process. If your engineer tells you that you are either: **Rushing/Dragging** or **Out of Tune**, be cognizant that this small flaw can jeopardize the track later in the Recording Process (when *you add elements like harmony, melody, and texture*).

Which leads nicely into the next tip:

# 14. Tune your instruments in between takes

Please bring a tuner to the session. In general, you should be ultra-aware of your tempo (*if you are a member of the rhythm section*) and your tuning/intonation (*if you are a member of the melody section*).

# 15. Do some exercise/stretches in between takes

This is really important — Exercising in between takes can significantly increase everyone’s mood and energy going back into the studio. You can actually hear the difference in the takes. Not to mention it can help relieve all that stress and any pent up aggression you have towards your band mates. Not only is exercise good for not having a heart attack when you are 50, it’ll actually make the recording process much smoother and make the takes themselves better (*in my opinion*).

[Relevant BoJack is Relevant](https://i.imgur.com/JEKZZed.png)

# 16. Show up prepared… to wait

The majority of your time in the studio will be spent sitting and waiting, listening to your band mates record, or working through the mix with the engineer. I recommend bringing something to keep you occupied but that won’t take you out of the zone or take too much energy away from you. I recommend a video game that you love but that is also something that you can put down in an instant and that you aren’t really invested in. Something simple, like Mario Kart or Super Smash Brothers, or even a Pokémon game. If you want to stay in a creative vibe, I recommend bringing something to draw or doodle with. Put on some headphones and go dance outside. (We have a Rubix cube that sees a lot of love)

The most important thing is not to bring something that will remove you from the mindset of the studio environment. I certainly do not recommend bringing your day job! I’ve heard many times: “I’ll just bring my computer and knock out some emails for my Marketing job while I wait for everyone to finish tracking”. This is a bad idea — it will remove you from the headspace that you need to be in to make the most out of your engineer’s time. Unless it is related to the Band (and this could be any amount of managerial tasks such as *ordering merchandise, responding to Promoters, confirming show details*, *etc*), I would leave it at home.

# 17. Beware of Burrito-itis

Pretty self-explanatory.

# 18. Hot tea makes a good coffee substitute for long recording sessions, but water is even better.

Staying Hydrated is super important, it’ll keep you focused for the longer sessions, not to mention being hydrated is just awesome in general. Also, make sure your vocalist knows about **Throat Coat**, that stuff is the mamma-jammas

[Throat Coat](https://i.imgur.com/lhtmVV0.jpg)

# 19. The engineer is not your enemy

The Recording Engineer has one job: ***Be the bridge that transfers the highest quality version of your music into the physical world***. This manifests itself differently from producer to producer… some engineers are technical producers and some engineers are people producers. It’s a balance of therapy and tough love, tech savvy & emotional capacity, having the mental fortitude to keep going and the discipline to know when you’ve gone far enough. The bottom line — The Engineer is just doing what they believe is the best thing for the final product. So if your engineer delivers constructive criticism to you, such as “*That take was a decent take, but I can hear the energy level dropping a bit. Let’s take 15 and regroup*”… don’t take it personally.

# 20. Bring your A-Game

Aside from the mental discipline needed for an efficient and productive studio session, I argue that every musician should take their instrument to the shop to get “tuned-up” before you begin your session.

1. **Guitarists**: a tune-up can address problems such as: Buzzing frets, Intonation problems, and Electrical noise, and will usually set you up with a set of fresh strings
2. **Vocalists**: Don’t go partying the night before and lose your voice plz & thx — signed, everyone.
3. **Drummers**: Put on new heads before the session and tune your drums every couple hours. Double check the chains on your kick and hi-hat pedals.
4. **Producers**: Check that all your cables, sound cards, interfaces, controllers and adapters are working before coming into the studio. We may not have what you need!
5. **Everyone else**: Don’t make fun of the drummer for tuning their kit, just be proud that they showed up at all (kidding :P)

# 21. The #1 goal should be capturing the energy of the performance

There is an indescribable rush of emotion and power that arises from well-performed and recorded music. It’s like tasting your mom’s signature dish, or watching a group of fighter jets dance in the skies. Where just for a moment, you forget about all the technical barriers and frustrations and troubleshooting… you forget to monitor the faders on your console or the dB levels on your mic pre-amps… and you sit back in awe at the musical masterpiece crafted in front of you. And you look down at your computer screen and watch with a smile as that energy is grasped from the ephemeral and poured like concrete into your hard drive. It’s the absolute best part about being an engineer — Capturing the joy and energy and… well, the magic.

# 22. Don’t suck, Have fun

I love our music and I like the guys that I’m playing with. We’ve got music released this year, more on the way, and we’ve been playing a lot this year. 

The other guys in my group are 21, 20, and 19. 
A lot of their friends are under 21. 
An issue with our shows is that they want their friends to come in and watch us, which happens when we do backyard shows, but it’s more difficult when it’s at a bar. 

We just played a show at a bar, and one of the guys said that he doesn’t want to play there anymore because his girlfriend (age 19) can’t be inside watching us. 

I understand where they’re coming from, but in my opinion, it’s important for us to play to people that aren’t just our friends and peer group, we should play to as many different audiences as possible, and venues and bars are some of the best places to do that. 

I’ve expressed this to them before but, they still don’t like the fact that bars and venues have age restrictions.

I'm such a coward about it. I hate eyes on me in any setting. I can play well when I'm alone, but as soon as I have an audience I start screwing up when playing anything that's not simple. Even if I write something cool and tell my wife to come hear it I'll screw it up every single time once she is present, and then when she leaves I'll get it right again. I was in a few bands as a teen and luckily could play in front of the few friends we would occasionally bring to practices, but I was terrified to get on stage when the time came. I was gonna suck it up and deal with it of course because It would have been more embarrassing to tell my friends I was scared, but fortunately we never made it that far so I never had to.

I've recently been getting into singing more, and my buddy and I have been producing some songs with me doing vocals instead of guitar. I kind of dig it and I think I like the idea of singing. But there's even more expectation for a stage presence as a singer because now you're talking to the crowd and people are paying more attention to you, at least as a guitarist I could just hang off to the side and do my thing. We're not even a band, so there's no plan to play any shows anytime soon. But last night I went to a show, and idk it just seemed so easy.  All these casual people just got on stage, did their thing, had fun, and got offstage. I kept just feeling disappointed that I've let so much time go by and haven't just done it yet.

He said I can either record a fully polished Single or a semi polished EP with 3-5 songs with one song recorded almost as polished as a single and obviously we chose the EP. I’m so excited but I’m also nervous as hell. I hope it goes well and when it’s finished I’ll definitely make sure to upload the songs here!!

It's all originals, written/recorded on pianos across the world, scored with found sounds into 3 continuous narratives (this is the 1st in a trilogy). Mostly solo, some Rhodes, some in bass/drums trio setup.

The project centers around the idea that music can transport us to places and experiences. So, if a song evokes any stories or memories or emotions for you, I would genuinely LOVE to know -- the live show features storytelling and there's always possibilities for weaving in new stuff, whether real or fantastical. If you're curious about more background, there was an [interview in JAZZIZ Magazine](https://www.jazziz.com/qa-eric-pan-travel-poems/) alongside the first single, and an [interview on Public Radio International’s “The World”](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-08-31/travel-takes-new-meaning-jazz-pianist-s-latest-album) with song clips too.

Truly hope you enjoy!

You may have seen a post from me before, but the initial response across subreddits was so positive that I felt that I would (hopefully?) be forgiven for the repeat post. Over the last few weeks, a friend and I have been building [emerge.fm](https://www.emerge.fm/) \- a platform that allows musicians to promote their work, and build their audience.

We've set up a [waitlist system](https://www.emerge.fm/portal/) and have crossed over a 100 sign ups in just a few days. Our goal is to try and build an awesome community of musicians in parallel with working on building out the product (slated to be done by early July) and I would love to hear what you all think. Any thoughts/feedback/criticism would be appreciated and if you think this sounds cool, **please join the waitlist** :)

Things didn't go that well and now I'm afraid of ever touching my guitar or to play in front of people. In other words, I feel like now I have stage fright.

To give some prior context, I play guitar for a couple of years and honestly I'm very good at it, people really respect my skills and I put a lot of effort into it. Despite all of this, I feel like a fraud and I have a hard time actually aknowledging my real value. Everyone expects a lot from me and that scares me.

On that night when we played, there was some trouble and we couldn't do a good sound check. For instance, I didn't even get to check how my guitar sounded and just plugged my stuff on stage, tuned and went for it after a very little adjustment.

Turns out the rhythm guitarist volume was too low for us to hear, and so it was the singer. I was also positioned in a bad corner of the stage were I couldn't even hear clearly the drummer. The place had bad acoustics and sometimes it was a complety mess. I couldn't keep the tempo with the band, which was also speeding up more than usual and fucked up some parts because of how ""blurry"" everything sounded.

Despite all of this, I tried to keep a good show and move to interact with the audience, which had a great time and even told me that my playing was awesome and received a lot of compliments. I know that I fucked some parts of some songs but I tried to keep a good face and had a lot of fun that night anyway.

Fast forward, we talk about the show during the day after and although everyone got their mistakes, I feel like I'm being accused of being the reason it didn't go well for the others. At this point I'm writing this more as a rant but most importantly, this is bringing me really bad feelings and I'm having trouble sleeping. I'm afraid of next band practice where we're going to listen to the recorded mix and relive the situation. I feel like because of this, I will be targeted or undervalued from now on on the band, and that makes me feel so bad.

Anyone else has had similar experiences? How do you recover from them? I would love to know about your approach towards these situations.

TLDR; Played in a gig where sound was a mess, couldn't hear the other instruments well and screwed up my playing. Now I'm feeling accused of the show failure by my bandmates and I don't feel well to enjoy playing for a while.",1710161464.0

You're at the mercy of the algorithms, forced to constantly [make low-quality content](https://www.tiktok.com/@perpetualstumusic/video/7333319325186641195) in the hopes an extra couple dozen people might hear your track, and maybe worst of all – you have real-time metrics reminding you how few people have actually checked your music out. People act like the whole ""you get paid $3 for every 1,000 plays you get on Spotify"" thing was the worst part of the modern music industry but I assure you, it barely cracks the top 10.

I'm lucky because my new project is basically bedroom pop so I'm not paying any money to record this stuff, but it's still a time commitment and I feel more than just a little cringe putting myself out there as a 40 year old father of two. I simply cannot IMAGINE if I was still in a band, responsible for 3-4 other people, AND we were paying $10k (or more!) to record only to have the music land with a resounding thud.

I know it's always been hard to promote music, but it seems like a lot of the essential apparatuses (for instance blogs that people organically read or non-algorithmic platforms) have been either nerfed to uselessness or eliminated altogether. There has to be a better way.

I'm sure everyone on here feels the same, so thanks for letting me vent. If you've got 2:30 and want to give my new [music video a watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaFnnqB6x9o&ab_channel=CloutChaser) and maybe cheer me up with some words of encouragement, that would be great.

When it did, I contemplated everything about my life and why I felt depressed for so many years no matter what I did. I realized it’s because I wasn’t pursuing music – as a teenager, everybody thought I was going to become a studio musician, or go to Berklee for songwriting, and really make something of my music. But, I had some sort of identity crisis and ended up going to a preppy catholic college, studied journalism and didn’t think about music for a very, very long time.

Now, this is everything I think about. It’s everything I want to do and my goal is simply to make a living off of this (even if it’s a terribly low income living, lol). So, I decided to pursue the easiest career I could think of, and now I’m a social media manager (and I work from home - I don’t want to take any job that isn’t work from home so I have more time for music).

But even with a work from home job as a social media manager, I’m finding it EXTREMELY hard to focus on music. I’m constantly worried about losing my job, or not making good enough content, etc. At the end of the day when I log off the computer, the only thing I want to do is watch tv. I just wish I realized this when I was a teenager so I could’ve spent my entire college career taking lessons, releasing music and maybe I would’ve been somewhere with it by now. But now as an adult with all of these distractions, I’m worried it’ll be near impossible to become successful.

Everyone had a blast and the venue was super pumped (love it when the staff are into the band).

Afterward, we're out amongst the people who are leftover (we mostly play till the place closes, so just kind of the stragglers) giving out stickers, etc., everyone saying nice things, and this British couple who are clearly tourists to our very touristy city, come right up to us and do the thing I hate where they touch your arm for emphasis:

""Oh, you guys were just so fun! What fun! But I have to know: What do you guys do for day jobs!?!""

I find this question crushingly depressing. None of the five of us have day jobs. The band doesn't pay all our bills, but we have other bands and other little creative money-makers and do lessons, etc. We cobble it together. It's hard! And some of us have spouses/partners who pay a lot of bills, too, it's true.

But do people not realize how insulting this sounds (we don't get it THAT much, but enough to be a thing)? Like, ""I had fun, but you're OBVIOUSLY NOT PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS,"" or maybe they just think it's impossible in America to make a living if some of it involves playing restaurant gigs for tourists? Should I say, ""I'm just a loser musician, but my wife is a doctor!""

I was nice. Assured them that music and creativity is pretty much all we do, etc., and she seemed so disappointed by that. Like she wanted to imagine us at shitty cube jobs, getting to unleash our wildest dreams on stage in front of her before we return to our work-a-day misery.

I dunno. It just pisses me off and I wish people wouldn't ask that question. It makes me feel super shitty.

**EDIT:** To be clear, I don't think they were TRYING to be offensive or that they had ill-intent. That's sort of my point, that it's just thoughtless, not that they're weird for assuming we might have day jobs. I KNOW THAT MOST MUSICIANS HAVE DAY JOBS. Which is why, in the moment, I took it in stride. I just thought I'd find a community of people here who could empathize with not wanting to be asked about a day job after a successful gig. But, yeah, I get it, musicians don't make any money and, no, it's not crazy to think we might have day jobs. At no point did I imply they would be weird for thinking that; in fact, I offered that as one of the possibilities! I just personally think it's depressing that someone who enjoyed our show would think to ask what our day jobs are after enjoying it. Maybe ""pissed off"" is not the right way to put it.

I spend 80-90 of time with my wife, mostly at home, but I am often hassled about how much time the bands take ""away from our marriage"". Is there any answer to this being accused of ""rather being with my jam buddies"" than to spend time at home. I am with her 6 evenings every week. Music is my ONLY hobby. Both bands play my original songs.  The ""working"" band has a great singer where I get to sing backups. In the ""weekly"" band I am the singer.

Admittedly, the summer is high-season for my bands and we pack our gigs mostly between June and October, so there are some months that get pretty dang busy. It can get annoying. But that pace isn't constant. It still averages out to one rehearsal midweek and one weekend show a month plus a few other (like 5-6 a year) daytime weekend rehearsals. Summer is also high season for complaining about my hobby.

I say to her I have one band that practices every week but does maybe 3 shows a year and the other band only rehearses occasionally, like5- 6 times a year on weekends, but that bands does basically 12 gigs a year. So, to me it adds up to the ""time"" of one band. She does want to hear that. She says I promised her years ago that I would not be in two bands. Maybe I did. I don't remember the incident. I only remember the hundred times she has brought it up along with accusing me of lying. 

She wants me to choose one band.

Today she mentioned the possibility of divorce again. It was probably a lashing out to hurt me because of her resentment and because it gets a reaction. I offered to go to Counseling.  I doubt it will come to that but I'm willing.

I play in an indie rock trio. We're under no delusions of grandeur, we're not primma donnas and rarely have any drama in our band. We usually have grear sound engineers when playing live.

We played at a ski resort recently and I did something I've never done before - cut the show early and left due to an incompetent and rude sound engineer. 

It was crazy from the start. The soundy was way too aggressive, talked on and on about how he worked for some of the biggest bands, blah blah. When I first walked up, he immediately came up to me with some weird technical question while I was still huffing and puffing from the long walk up 6 flights of stairs. No hi, no introduction, just a pushy ass confusing question. Turns out he did the same with my bandmates. He set us all on edge from moment one, and never ceased making us feel inferior.

Here are some of the things he said, in no particular order: 

""Do you read music? No? I read music. I don't think you're a real musician until you read music.""

(After Bandmate joked with him that after working with so many big bands, it must be a letdown to work for a middling band like ours) ""Yeah, tell me about it.""

""Your guitar sounds like shit, dude, you should get a new one.""

""Listen, I'm not here to be friends, I'm here to protect my equipment from getting damaged."" (I retorted, ""Funny, I thought you were here to make the band sound as best you can."")

""You don't have a bass player? That's ridiculous. I'm a classically trained bass player. I read music. Do you read music?""

(After asking bandmate to give a complete run down of our stage plot, which I had emailed two weeks before the show, I told him we had already emailed it per his request): ""Yeah yeah, I know you emailed it but I didn't look at it, so I need you to verbally walk me through what you need.""

It went on and on.

Every time I asked for something simple, like more guitar in the stage monitor, he rolled his eyes and fought me on it. It took him 15 mins to finally get guitar into my wedge, then my bandmate started sound checking and I asked to have her instruments way down in my wedge. ""I can't seperate them out, they'll be at the same level the whole show"" he said. ""You CAN seperate them out,"" I said, beginning to lose my patience. ""I can't have her instrument that high in my wedge, it's too much and can't hear myself."" He rolled his eyes and got out a new cord, was done seperating the wedges in like 3 mins. (I know the board he was working with.)

The mains were just to my left on stage and I was getting WAY too much stage noise from them. I asked what could be done and sound guy shrugged and said, ""nothing."" It just sounded terrible on stage. Like I was playing in a hallway next to a gym. 

I finally stopped asking for things because it just got too awkward. When we started playing and the drums kicked in, I couldn't hear any guitar, could hear my vocals blown way out in the wedge and could hear my bandmate's banjo at top volume. And I could tell the mix was way too high for the mains. Some friends in the audience confirmed it sounded like shit and was way too high of a volume. There was steady feedback every song.

After every song, I would give him hand cues to adjust monitor (pointing to guitar, then up, pointing to mic then down, etc.) But he never understood them, or acted like he didn't.  He kept yelling over to us, in front of the crowd, ""What is it you want now? Can't you just deal with it? 

He was also a dial tweaker. Suddenly, without warning, my vocals would surge in the monitor and I'd have to back way off the mic. Then we kept getting massive  feedback, which he blamed on my guitar. I said it was my mic, and demonstrated it to him (this is all mid-show, mind you) and said the volume was way too high. He finally adjusted it.

Then, as if punishing me, I could no longer hear my guitar at all. It's like he cut it completely out of the wedges, not just for me, but for everyone. My drummer kept missing the 1 because he couldn't hear me. 

I could go on and on... this is just a sampling of that shitty night. After one set. We took a break and I went and had a beer with the manager, told her we were struggling with the sound guy and she said, ""Yeah, I can tell. I'm so sorry. Every band we've had this year has complained about him. I asked him to slow his roll, but he just said, 'this is how I talk.' If you want to bail, I understand.""

I told her she could pay us less if she wanted, but I didn't want to finish the gig. First time in 12 years of gigging live that I bailed on a show before the end. 

Sound guys: what do you think about his attitude? Isn't one of the duties of a live sound engineer to communicate with the band, not make them feel unwanted and stupid? How should I have handled this situation better?

We're just a group of dipshits who like to play music and have very little drama, but after this experience I felt like I was somehow missing something. Any thoughts?",1671901956.0

We have developed an app where you will be able to jam together and we are looking for people to test it! 

The app lets you upload videos of yourself playing an instrument. If someone else comes and likes your track, they can respond to it by playing over your base track. That will create a new video of the two playing together. If this keeps happening a tree of compositions will be created. Basically, like a reddit conversation but with music. We have also developed a way to explore this tree of compositions so anyone can join at any point they like!

We already shared the idea in this subreddit some time ago and got a really nice response from the community. We are looking for people that wants to try the app and get involved with the development by giving feedback. We are linking here our landing page where you can leave your email so we can send you the app and credentials. 

Please bare with us as the app is still in early stages of development. However, we want to have feedback from the community as soon as possible so we can shape Rifftr together.

I taught myself to play when I was a teenager because I was bursting with the desire to express my emotions. I’ve gotten a lot better over the years but I keep things very simple. My guitar playing is terrible, my piano skills are mediocre but people like the emotion I put into my lyrics and voice.

My vocal instrument got much better over time but I was getting positive reactions even when I was technically a terrible singer. I’ve gotten many compliments from musicians over the years, I even convinced a couple to let me be the frontman of my own band- musicians who were much much much better than myself.

I have gotten the biggest compliments and biggest criticisms days apart. Sometimes I wonder if I’m offending actually talented artists when crowds respond positively to me. I’m asking because I’m genuinely confused to what actually makes someone “talented”. I just consider myself to be passionate about expressing myself through music.

My wife and I go to this small restaurant and bar now and then primarily to hear the live music, though the food and drinks are not bad. 

This place brings in musicians regularly. It’s mainly 2 or 3 people, on guitars with a singer. There’s no stage, they’re pushed into a corner of the place. They bring their own audio equipment. 

Anyway I feel sorry for the musicians. The talk is overwhelming (like last night). They get applause then the background talk gets loud again. 

These aren’t up and coming musicians trying to make it; they’re typically older and talented; it’s more a sideshow gig I guess.

639,Today i learned something horrifying happened within my band.. (advice please),44,r7siqf,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/r7siqf/today_i_learned_something_horrifying_happened/,32,"Me and my band mates have been working together for about 3 years.. This is a simple (we do it the traditional way, without technology except to record and mix) and small band, only 4 four of us. 3 male(including me), 1 female, All of them are my best friends. A few weeks ago i was talking to Marissa, the female, (not her real name btw) and we have been super close for several years.

Somewhere in the convo she told me shes been having an extremely hard time feeling comfortable helping us with our music (usually when we write we all are in the same room doing it together, put this cuz it comes up later) and she is thinking about quiting and she was wanting to know if i was ok with that, obviously i was a bit upset because i would miss her creativity and bonding over making music but i told her she should do whatever makes her happiest and that if this band is no longer one of those things, then she should try something else..

I was curious though, why after all this time and why did it feel so sudden? why did she feel uncomfortable?? i havent noticed her acting off around us but i didnt question it because i was more focused on making sure it wouldnt damage our friendship. Fast forward untill now, shes still been working with us so i assumed she decided not to but i was still curious and we had planned to meet up today just to hang out and talk about life so i decided id bring it up then and see what it was about ya know....

when i brang it up and asked her what the deal was, it was an instant mood killer. She got really quiet... she almost didnt even talk to me, she just sat there silent for such a long time, i told her that we dont have to talk about it and after a few minutes of silence she started crying and obviously i was confused and i felt bad for bringing it up because whatever the reason it obviously made her very distressed.

She stared straight ahead at a wall and told me that she isnt comfortable being around a certain person in our band (she refused to say who) because they raped her..

""Holy shit"" that was my instant reaction. it just came out.

i didnt and still dont know what to think, i dont know if i shouldve but i asked her who and she wouldnt answer so i left it at that and i told her that i can help her find help, this is serious and trauma is no joke but she said that she doesnt want to talk to anyone about it.

we sat there for a while, her shifting from silently crying to a cold blank look and me sitting there trying figure out what to say or do.

WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO??? i feel so sick thinking about how a rapist is going to be sitting in the same room as their victim in just a few days... and how both people are some of my best friends... ANY ADVICE??? I dont know who and if i ask both would obviously deny it do i tell authorities the fuck do i do? this definitly most likely going to ruin what we have going.

&#x200B;

Long Edit:

Thank You guys for all the replies, you guys have said alot of things i didnt even consider, i assume due to shock. I havent totally decided what to do but im thinking about departing from them and hopefully that will help marissa feel better about leaving as well.

Bands come and go, and your right, in this situation the music is probably the least important thing to be worrying about. It was selfish of me to focus more on the ""oh no we cant make music anymore"" part.

(Im not saying im quitting music, far from it.. if i do this, im going to try to make a new band (with marissa of course..hopefully) but without the same mistake of letting someone bad in because i didnt know them as well as i shouldve before hand. )

I feel like this morning, the knowledge of what happened has settled in even more then when i posted this.  Im not going to pressure her into saying who or do the legal stuff for her without her approval because that can make distress alot worse when the persons not ready.. but im going to try my best to non suspiciously (to the other band mates) make sure she doesnt feel like she has to spend another day with the guy that did it.

Also, the writting/jamming/whatever you guys call it session is cancelled for me.

Thank you! again!",1638512764.0

Hey everyone. 

I have a day job, and I really don’t mind my day job. It’s low stress and pays the bills. It’s good work life balance. 35-40 hours a week. 

It allows me to spend 2-4 hours an evening playing guitar and working on my craft. 

I’m writing though because I’m feeling incredibly down bad about my service to music. Like I feel like in my own head I label myself a weekend warrior and that’s all I will ever be, because I don’t practice 7-8 hours a day. 

I’m a pretty popular local gun for hire. But just feeling down.

And I am in fact a metalhead and so typically the music I play is fast and, obviously, heavy.

I started out by playing rhythm guitar and got bored after like 2 years. I didn’t want to shred or nothing (at the time), but I wanted a challenge.

So I moved up to lead and had a hell of a time. I was having so much fun and it felt like I had a whole array of options to chose from.

But then I’m scrolling through TikTok and I run into a Metallica TikTok. Now, I’ll be the first to say, I was fairly snobby with the bands I listened too.

The video was a live performance of Creeping Death from like 1989 and it was the breakdown portion with Jason screaming “Die” over and over with James singing along with it.

I was very stubborn with Metallica but decided to give them a chance. And then I run into one TikTok that changed everything.

I see a TikTok of Jason Newsted playing a bass solo and I’m immediately intrigued in a way I haven’t been with guitar in a long time.

So I pick the bass up again and I start writing my own stuff. And holy shit, for the first time, I’m genuinely confident in what I’m playing and my capabilities!

I was actually capable of playing for people and not getting embarrassed, I felt I was doing it right! I didn’t have to play a cover of someone else’s song to feel like I was half decent.

Hell, I only play one song on the bass and I still have enough confidence to feel I’m a good enough musician! The rest I can play is my own stuff!

I did a course in Music Tech when I was in high school and that skill seems to keep on giving especially right now. *The course in music tech wasn't even that difficult* and I bet most universities/conservators provide electives that students can pick.

When we were all asked to do a video exams and lessons when lockdown started it became apparent that my **Music Tech skills opened more doors to solve problems.** I cringed at most student’s exam videos as they didn't have the means to capture sound properly or edit their recordings so that their bad phone mics didn't distort.

Also if you want to become a composer I would argue that *DAW skills are way more important than Sibelius skills* as you can harness a DAW to explore creative arrangements, record other performers playing your compositions or manipulating midi instruments to try out new things. It really helps with inventing musical ideas quickly especially if you know your way around a midi keyboard.

**You only need to learn how to record yourself** with proper techniques and know your way around a DAW to capture your best sound. Leave all the complicated mixing, multitrack, session recording, midi sampling and plugins to the sound engineering students.

I would say that there's no real negative to this apart from the price to own the tech and software;

&#x200B;

* *Scarlett - £132.00*
* *Rode nT1 vocal mic - £151.00*
* *Mic Stand - £30*
* *xlr cable - £12*
* *MacBook pro - £1348      (unfortunately I haven't found a windows alternative.)*
* *Logic pro - £199*

That £1872 is just really shit and is probably the only thing stopping lots of musicians exploring ways to capture their sound.

*By T. Perry Bowers*

This title is a trick. There is no door. There is nobody keeping you out of the industry and no\-one will open a magic door to let you in. 

If you wanted to get into the hardware business, you wouldn’t ask how to get in, you’d just start creating your business.  But for some reason there is a fantasy in the music industry about a guy behind a desk, smoking a cigar, pulling all the strings to let people in or keep them out.

While there are some powerful people pulling strings at the very highest levels, nothing could be further from the truth down here at the bottom.  However I have had two instances in the last few months that prove that the fantasy belief is still strong. 

In the first instance a young man came to me and asked if his song was any good. He played it for me on his iPad. It was absolutely terrible. It was a rap song, so it’s not a genre I consider myself an expert in, but I know bad music when I hear it. The rhymes were cliché. The rhythms were simple and childlike \(actually he was off rhythm most of the time\). His lyrics were unimaginative and his beat was like something from a speak and spell in the eighties. It was so bad that I had to keep myself from laughing. But then, the weirdest thing happened. I got angry. 

I guess I got angry because the kid was wasting my time. It had nothing to do with his music being so bad. It was his obvious lack of work ethic that irritated me. It was one of the first songs he ever created. He had some late night inspiration, programmed the beat, wrote and recorded the lyrics on some cheap audio program, and decided he needed to speak to someone who owned a studio immediately to “get his foot in the door.”  He hadn’t done any real work.

If you’re reading this, you’re probably a fairly serious musician. You practice your instrument at least a few times a week. You’ve been in bands that played locally or even nationally. You work on your craft a lot and have been for a long time. This kid records a stupid rap song and goes straight to a studio owner trying to solicit advice and accolades. Does it make you angry too? 

I asked him who his favorite rapper is. He said Eminem. So I asked him how he thought his song compared to an Eminem song. He said his song was good, but obviously Eminem’s song was better. I asked him how he thought his rap style compared to Eminem’s. He said he had a different style, but he was getting better. I burst his bubble. I told him his beat and his lyrics were at a kindergarten level compared to Eminem’s. I told him he would have to put in tens of thousands of hours of practice if he wanted to get close to touching Eminem’s talent and skill. I told him “go home and work hard for a year and see what happens.” Well, it’s only been a month and he’s sent me some new songs. They’re still awful. I’m still annoyed. 

Even though I do appreciate his persistence, there is another thing that bothers me about this situation. I told him to listen only to himself. I said if he likes it and he thinks his music is good, then it’s good. Why is he asking me then? He obviously didn’t listen to my advice, which was “don’t ask me if your music is good.” And he’s not listening to his own inner voice either. Listening to my inner voice is something I wish I had done a long time ago. It would have been really helpful in my twenties when I was really trying to “make it” as a musician. 

Your inner voice will tell you everything. It will tell you if your music is good and if a song is a “hit” or not. It will also tell you if you are delusional. It will tell you if you’re addicted to drugs, if your marriage is a disaster, if you’re a good person or a lazy one. You just have to cultivate a relationship with that voice and listen to it. Once you have a clear connection to your inner voice, you don’t need anyone else to tell you what you need to know. 

Which brings me to my second circumstance – another situation that reinforced my belief that people in the music business are mostly delusional. A young man sent me an email, saying he wanted to change his career and be a band manager. He was wondering if I could refer him to some band managers in the industry to give him some advice. The fact is, I’m not sure there is such a career as “band manager.” There are people who perform functions for bands. You can call it whatever you want.  These people book gigs. They set up tours, organize recording sessions and perform functions the band doesn’t have time to do for themselves.

I once worked with a very successful independent rapper. I witnessed how he put his own tours together, negotiated his own rehearsal space rent, paid his own rehearsal space rent, set up rehearsals with his band, booked TV show appearances, etc. He was his own manager. He was making millions of dollars but he was not outsourcing the role of manager to anyone. He may have had some folks who helped him do things, but he was managing his band. On his own. Period. 

So I have set up a meeting with this young man and I’m going to tell him that a “band manager” simply provides services for a band. The first service they might need is help hauling their gear on the road.  I was lucky enough to call Monty Lee Wilkes my friend. He was a very successful band manager and front of house engineer \(Nirvana, Replacements, Brittany Spears\). He was pushing road cases before he started managing anyone. 

This is how you get your foot in the door. You start doing the things that bands need. Hauling gear, booking shows, running the table, creating an email list, whatever they need. Don’t focus on the title of the job, think about what the job actually requires. My advice to this kid is going to be “find a band and do something helpful for them.” It’s very simple. Make yourself valuable to the artists and do something for them that they can’t \(or don’t want to\) do for themselves. Most importantly, do something that makes you and the band some money. If you can’t find opportunities to make money for your artists, you are useless as a manager. 

At the beginning it’s going to suck. There are a lot of road cases to be pushed and sandwiches to be purchased. If you want to be an artist yourself, there will be times when you want to cry because your own music is so bad. But, if you really want it, and few people actually do, you will persevere. It may take you a thousand hours, but it will happen. Start small. Provide service. Create opportunities for yourself or your artist. Repeat. Over and over again.

**my bio** \- I always make sure it's got the latest link to whatever I'm pushing - new tracks, gig tickets, you name it. also, throwing in my other socials because, why not? more ways to stay connected.

**carousels** \- to show off the journey of my songs, album artwork, and even lyric breakdowns or just random days making music. love Canva for this! makes it easier for me to curate my feed. (rumour has it that every time a user swipes on your carousel, Instagram considers it an engagement. so, even if that user doesn’t like, comment, or share, they’ve still engaged with your post.)

**stories** \- what i love about this is I don’t have to overthink this. dropping a new track? share a snippet. gig night? go backstage live. also a great way to get to know my audience!

**highlights** \- for new followers so they can flip through my past stories based on different interests. made one for studio times, one for rehearsals, etc. found these awesome cover templates on Boost App Social that really fit my style. they have story templates too!

**reels** \-  I post bits of my tracks, music video teasers, and some behind-the-scenes action.

**don’t forget to add your tracks to IG’s music library!** srsly, now you can slap your tunes on pretty much everything IG offers - reels, stories, carousels, and yeah, even notes now!",1709627310.0

I (25M) Am having the hardest time navigating around the area as a musician, it’s quite plentiful in the west coast, especially in the city. Everybody seems so full of themselves, “THIS IS GONNA BE OUR BIG HIT” and then it goes nowhere and nobody cares and they blame it on society for being out of touch or something. 

Years ago I put out a Craigslist ad to see if I could get any work as a piano player/keyboardist and I woke up to about 20 emails, some of them were kinda demanding and rude. 

I picked 3 of the bands and watched them all fall apart. I’m still wondering if I should spend my younger years being that eccentric keyboardist everybody seems to want or if I should just play music for myself and anybody who happens to be over.

678,You don’t need to be in a band to make music or play shows,42,16l7duo,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/16l7duo/you_dont_need_to_be_in_a_band_to_make_music_or/,24,"A lot of the posts on here are about band drama, people depressed because their band broke up, people struggling to start bands, etc. As a musician who has played lots of shows and never officially been in a band, I just wanted to share my perspective in case it helps someone.

I’ve always hated having to coordinate with other people to play music, so since I got into a music I’ve always been attracted to styles that don’t require other people—electronic music, classical guitar, folk guitar, free improv, and noise. Also composing classical music where yes you do need work with other people for your work to be performed, but often that just means submitting to a competition.   

Now that’s all well and good, but what if you don’t already have an affinity for a style of music that is well suited to solo artists or play an instrument that is conducive to solo performance? How do you craft a solo set, and how do you find gigs as a solo act? For guitar players it’s pretty easy. You could just learn a style of guitar playing that works ina solo guitar context. Or if you want to sound like a band, just get like a looper or sampler, maybe a pitch shifter, a drum machine, and crank it up. Or just use Ableton. As long as you keep in mind what would be interesting to watch as an audience member while you’re writing, you can create a pretty engaging set. But let’s say you’re a drummer or a saxophonist or something. What do you do in that case? Lots of drummers are creating awesome live shows playing an acoustic set and triggering events in Ableton or a sampler using a few pads. And for wind/brass players—you can use guitar pedals too, and also EWIs have come a long way.

Now how do you find shows? If you’re playing lots of rock shows, you might find that it’s hard to book a solo show. Well, you’ll find that alternative music scenes are actually a lot more accepting of different genres than you might think. You will see lots of solo folk or synth pop sets at like black metal and noise shows. I’m not advocating for a full scale gentrification of the harsh noise scene by Reddit bedroom producers. I’m just saying there are very accepting alternative music scenes out there.

But don’t you need to play with other people for like, your soul or whatever? Communing with your fellow man through the joy of song is magical and healing! I play in orchestras, I do one of improv sets and jams. I even do occasional collaborative albums. I play with other people a lot. And it’s good—that’s how I network to promote my solo work. But most of the serious music I make is by myself. So if you want the healing power of playing with other people without being in a band, just join a choir or something. Just wanted to share because I suspect there might be other people on here who work best alone but don’t know how many alternatives there are to being in bands.",1694973430.0

To clarify - I was brought in for rhythm guitar, so I couldn't get away with noodling leads. The songs were originals and pretty obscure covers. 

I tried out for a band recently. I asked what songs we'd be doing and they sent their entire setlist, without chord sheets. At the practice I asked about the chords of the songs they were about to start, and they'd tell me the key and then go. I had to basically follow along by looking at their fingers on the fretboards. I was able to basically work it out, with some leads, although I was shaky. I thought that was impressive, considering, but they sent me a vague rejection the next day.

I just find this really frustrating and unprofessional. I can't tell if it's them being unprepared or if it's some kind of hazing. Do bands really expect to find someone who knows every song in a genre or has perfect pitch allowing them to pick up any chord being played? People like that exist, but they're session players in Nashville, not people looking for something to do with their weekends.

Yet, English is not our mother tongue and I can hear that when we sing, we've got a French accent... we also hesitate whether to use one word or another... It just doesn't feel natural in practice.

What feels natural though, is to write my songs in English because basically all my influences are English/American/Australian bands. To me, music has been associated to English since I was a child...  It just comes out this way when I compose with my guitar... But I feel a little ashamed that I'm not using my native language - French - which I find sounds silly and naive when played in pop songs (I mostly write pop-indie songs).

Also, I feel like it could be perceived as stupid by English native speakers to sing with an accent. Do you ever laugh at accents in singers' voices? (speaking to English native speakers here). As a native English speaker, what would your advice be?

The other members of the band think this is a bad idea and that it will lose us gigs and that other bands in our area get recognition for having 100% original sets (though I've never heard anyone say this).

Hadn’t heard from dude since like 08, so it was a surprise, but coo to hear from him. They’re all doing well now. The recording was the first song ever written by my first band from when I was like 17-18. First song ever written, even as individuals. Someone rewrote it, recorded it, and mastered it. Unbelievable. The intro had pieces of our other songs in the which had this coo effect of tuning an old radio. We never had the money to record, so the kids could only listen to our crusty garage recordings from our MySpace (RIP🙏🏼) Anyway, I wasn’t expecting this. Somebody still finds our music relevant to them. They took the time to dig up this forgotten fossil of a song from the abyss and made a clean recording out of it and we always wanted that. The details and fills I did with my drums, even the way I hit the bass pedal was precise in the recording, along with the other instruments. How can somebody remember that? I find it incredible, really. But, more importantly, thinking about it let’s me know that I did something right for people, that all 5 of us did. We came together and collectively wrote music that people enjoyed. We actually played a part in shaping memories that these people found worth hanging on to. Thats a real good feeling and good feelings are good for you. All we were was a few teenagers with music constantly on our minds, few instruments in hand, ready to explain our hearts, through our art. We were the ones responsible for making the kids wanna tear down the basement of Jerry’s Pizza every time we played. We were the ones responsible and made music for the kids, by the kids.

I come from a family of musicians in Mississippi, and of course being both musicians and Mississippians we're ridiculously poor. 

For years my dad talked about how he used to borrow his friend's Baldwin guitar, and it was the best guitar he ever played. Well, I worked my ass off, skipped meals, and didn't spend money on anything but groceries or bills for a couple years, and three years ago I finally saved up enough to buy him one for his birthday - it was the most expensive thing I'd ever bought (I think it was about $500) and I was so happy to finally get it for him. I don't think he'd ever had a really nice guitar before - just a cheap acoustic, and whatever friends would lend him for shows.

I just found out that his roommate stole it and probably sold it. There's no way I could ever afford to replace it now, since I have health problems and can't work full time anymore (not to mention the quarantine.) It feels like a kick in the teeth during an already ridiculously difficult time in my life, especially since my dad has been sick with Covid-19 for over a month now. 

I'm hoping to save up for one of the newer Baldwins I've seen on Ebay, which are cheaper, but it could be years before I have $200 to spare, and my dad is in such bad health I don't know if he'll make it that long.

Just burnt out on doing just TV/film for the past 20 years, I feel dead creatively, my work is empty and boring,  it's just not as cool as working/being around music.

I sometimes can have really bad social anxiety and can suffer from panic/anxiety attacks from time to time, although this has significantly improved compared to many years ago. 

So yesterday I somehow gained the courage to attend an audition at a studio with a live band, they're a prog band looking for a vocalist and I adore metal and am very interested in being a part of a band; especially one that dabbles in prog or metal. 

Days before the audition I kept getting the urge to cancel the audition (anxiety does that to you) but somehow managed to soldier through, turned up to the audition and met the band members. This was my first EVER experience in my entire life singing alongside or even performing with a band, as well as massively venturing outside of my comfort zone by singing in front of strangers that I'd only just met that day for the first time. I've never had the chance or opportunity to do this before so there was many big ""first's"" on this day.

I'd been practicing two songs the band wanted to try out together in the days before the audition but had trouble keeping well timed with the live band. We tried playing and singing alongside the track and I found myself to significantly improve with the timing when we did that, the other bassist and guitarist also stopped multiple times for little mistakes (as is to be accepted when you're merely practicing or rehearsing). I was reassured that me making errors with the timing was okay and was to be expected as it was our first time jamming together.

I felt like I got on really well with the band members, there was a lot of banger and general funny back and forth, we all went home on our separate ways then I didn't hear from any of the band for almost 24hrs. Obviously after an audition you expect an update and I began getting a really bad gut feeling that I was about to be told no. 

Mustered the balls to message the bassist that I was in contact with and asked whether I'd be joining their ranks and if I'd be at the next rehearsal or not...

Then received a message saying I had a great voice was vocally in tune but that the problems I had with timing were a big issue and because of this they wouldn't be accepting me into their band. 😭😭

I'm absolutely devastated now. Not just because this was one of my first proper times putting myself out there as a vocalist but because I genuinely thought it went well when that obviously wasn't the case. 

I REALLY would love to be a part of a band but experiences like this are so demotivating and make you want to just give up. 

Has anyone else experienced anything like this before? And what did you do after or how did you handle the experience? Did you give up or continue and eventually find a band or something that suited you? 

Big thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this, it's really appreciated! 💜 Trying to not give up here and just take this as another learning experience but it still feels very 💩.

Edit: ****Oh my goodness, all of you are just so thoughtful, supportive and understanding; thank you so much for all the advice, tips, sharing of your own personal experiences and just in general, overall feeling of being heard and understood. 🫶

You've no idea how much I appreciate all of your comments, this is my first post on Reddit after a situation that really knocked my confidence but after reading all of your kind, constructive and judgement-free comments, I feel more motivated now to keep on with the path I've just begun on and not let one audition ending with a no stop me from making even more progress. I have a lot I can work on and with now and will definitely be taking a lot of the tips mentioned in this thread on board, especially buying and working alongside a metronome, I think that'll work wonders! 🥹

I've always been the kind of person who is always eager to improve and get better at my craft and after hearing that many people experienced the same with auditions in the realm of music, it's made me realize it's more common that I initially thought. Not just that but you shouldn't let one audition not going the way you want equal giving up on something you love *entirely*.

I've been making music for about a decade and I've never really had this problem until I started trying to promote my band this year. Tbh, things are going well for my band. We have regular gigs, people actually enjoy our original music (not just cover songs), and we're getting paid a decent amount for the shows. I have a lot of fun and I really enjoy playing with them and making music.

Everytime I get on insta I see other local bands playing venues I want to play at. I see someone make a post like ours and get tons of likes. I go to see other bands shows and they have photographers there and tons of fans online that actually show up to their gigs and it's making me become someone I never thought I'd be.

I catch myself complaining that we don't get shows at ""good venues"" or saying that we need to do better stuff on social media, when I know that stuff doesn't really matter. I want us to be sucessful and I know social media is a part of that, but I think it's making me a worse person and a worse musician. I don't really know what to do about it at this point. I feel like I've just become jaded and cynical and I really hate myself for it. I feel like that woman who got famous for saying, ""My life sucks... I'm an artists and blah blah blah...""

754,Landlord wants me to stop singing,39,jhi07i,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/jhi07i/landlord_wants_me_to_stop_singing/,46,"Hey everyone! 

I am new to this sub, but thought this would be a good place to post this question, as I am sure some of you will be able to relate to my issue. I apologize in advance for how long this is going to be. 

So I am majoring in Music Education, and my instrument is voice. I have been singing my whole life and I hope to one day teach vocal lessons to kids and young adults. I just started my first semester in the fall and all of my classes are online. This means my vocal instruction, applied voice, ear training, and ensemble class are all taking place via zoom. I have been taking these classes since August and I have not heard a single complaint. Neither my landlord or any of my neighbors have sent me any sort of messages or complaints about singing. I never sing past 9pm or before 10am because I am always very respectful about quiet hours. 

I am living in a small 1 bedroom apartment with my boyfriend. It's about 400 square feet and we do not have a walk in closet, or any space that I can sound proof. My boyfriend also works from home and he uses his the bedroom as his office so I do all of my classes and all of my practicing in the living room. 

On Wednesday, my landlord came and knocked on my door in the middle of my voice lesson (at 3 in the afternoon) and told me that I needed to stop singing. When I told him that I was in the middle of a voice lesson, he shrugged and told me that two tenants have moved out because of my singing, and that he has neglected to tell me because he didn't want to hurt my feelings. When I asked him what he expected me to do, he just kinda shrugged and kept repeating that two tenants have moved out because of my singing. I told him that I could move farther away from the windows (which were closed) and he kinda shrugged again and said ""I don't know if that will work"". This whole time my vocal instructor was sitting there on zoom listening to the whole thing go down. I told my landlord that I might have to move to a different apartment if I can't sing at this apartment because that's what I'm going to school for. He kinda shrugged again and said ""I don't know."" I still had to finish the second half of my vocal lesson feeling like complete and total shit and just wanting to die. 

From the tone of the conversation, it seemed to me like my landlord was trying to subtly suggest that I move out. That is what I assumed because that was the only solution that made sense to me. Also the fact that he told me two tenants have moved out because of my singing. (And repeated it twice even though he claimed not to want to hurt my feelings) That really made me think that he was suggesting I leave because it would be cost effective for him to get me out of the complex so that he will stop losing tenants. 

So later that night my boyfriend called my landlord to talk about the possibility of getting out of our lease early. My landlord told him that he wasn't interested in anything like that and that we would not be able to get out of the lease early. He suggested that I just ""keep it down."" At this point my boyfriend got kind of upset and told him that I'm going to school for singing and that it is completely unreasonable for him to expect me to stop. He then asked why we were never informed when people complained about my singing and he said that nobody has complained before and that he was actually in a bad mood and it was just annoying him. (My landlord doesn't even live in the complex, he is just here doing maintenance a lot) Which makes no sense because how would he know that two tenants moved out because of my singing if they had not complained?? Also why would he keep letting tenants out of their lease because of MY singing and then not let me out of my lease. It seems like he was lying about tenants moving out to guilt me enough that I would stop singing, but I'm not sure. 

At this point I genuinely don't feel comfortable in my home anymore and I'm upset that he would not let us move out after he basically just told me I can't do the thing I'm going to school to do. I'm supposed to practice every day and I have a vocal performance (via zoom) coming up very soon and I don't even have the courage to practice for it. I haven't practiced once since Wednesday when he came to my door because I just feel completely insecure. I am a talented singer, I know my voice doesn't sound bad but it can be loud. I try to sing quietly most of the time unless I am in a performance or a vocal lesson, but it's clearly not enough for him. I can't enjoy singing at all now, and I don't currently have access to a practice room or anything.

I am at a loss. I don't have any idea what I should do about this. Is there anyone out there who has any advice for me or who has been through a similar experience? If so please help me!!",1603578022.0

You are too loud. With a near certainty I can tell you that you are playing too loud, and you don't sound as good as you should because of this. Actually, you probably sound like shit. Think of the car next to you at the red light with the overdriven bass- does that sound awesome?

The acoustics in most bars suck, and being loud just makes it worse. If the people in the back of the club cannot talk until the song ends, you are doing it wrong. The best sounding bands are only loud in front of the stage. People should be able to have a conversation in the back of the venue without screaming into each others' ears.

Your mix is wrong. You don't need Todd Rundgren to figure this out. Have someone's girlfriend tell you whether all the members can be heard from where the people will be.  And, you all know who the better players are, and who the weakest link is. Dial down the weaker player just a touch, they make the better musicians sound bad. Duh. 

Loudness does not trump musicianship. As long as people can hear the drums, they will fill the dance floor. They don't need to go deaf to have a good time...

We initially connected last year at a wedding gig and this year, we’ve been doing more and more performances together and organizing some more events for later in the year. It’s been fun getting to know them and working with them. 

There is just one thing that I keep thinking of and I’m not sure if I’m being pretentious for this. Am I a diva for wanting a setlist and rehearsals? 

For the past few performances we’ve done, we would have one rehearsal and only go through a small portion of the setlist, by small, maybe 5 songs of the 12+ song setlist. We would then perform the show, and the artist would pick songs at random from the setlist, extend the songs and change the feel from the recorded versions. 

The more recent performances we’ve done, we don’t do any rehearsal, and we just follow what chords they start with and do our best to follow them. 

I love when artists improvise, however, I know artists improvise based off knowing the form of the songs backwards and front.

That said, everyone was there for the party scene at the bar, and were not traveling to see this person play.

Skip two weeks later he calls the cops again. Lying to the cops that we’re doing something illegal. Yeah. The cops search the apartment and tell us that it was not a noise complaint. And so they leave.

I have a small band, with 5 members (including me on bass). A few months ago, I wrote a song on my own, and wanted to produce it with my band. We recorded the song, took a little more than 50 hours of collective work (each instrument/ vocal, and the technical part). Since I had already composed the lyrics and the instrumental, each member only had to play their instruments, except for our drummer, who also took care of the recording stuff. 

The song ended up being very good, and everyone seemed to be satisfied with it. But the guitarrist said it was better if we made a few more songs before we released that one as part of an album. Everyone agreed.

Months go by, and no new song had been made. I express my thoughs about leaving my song gathering dust, and how I wanted to release it. The singer said he didn't dislike the song, but wanted to have the band linked to some more serious songs, and I respected his opinion. 

My guitarrist, on the other hand, said that he thought the song sounded bad, and he didn't want to have his name associated with bad songs, so I ""should release it as a solo artist, and don't cradit him"" (his words)

Since he made it pretty clear that he didn't want his name on it, but had no problem with it being released, I posted the song on SoundCloud. 

A little more than a week passes by, and he starts raging over the song being released with ""his parts"" on. An demanded that I recorded it without his guitar. I didn't have a problem with it, was only a little upset about changing it. (But I understand he has this right, despite saing it was ok for me to released it as it was)

This turns into a fight among the band members, because we were having a problem about his ego problems, and that was the last straw for them. 

He started saying that he was the only one putting time and effort on the band (totally not true) and that only he knew how to make a successfull band, despite never having one. 

After a few hours discussing, we agreed on him leaving the band, and thought that was the end of it. 

Later we find out that he had deleted everything on our instagram.

Sorry for the long post, bur I wanted to vent about this situation with other musicians. 

I forgot to mention that this guy was my best friend.

I’m a medium level musician playing in a small trio of original bluegrassy/jammy stuff. All of us are mostly casual/campfire players, no one is professionally trained. We have discussed doing some professional recording. My band mates have messaged the nicest studio around and gotten a quote. Obviously it’s pretty pricey but this studio has recorded a lot of high tier groups. The quote was per 12 hour digital days.

Soon after receiving the quote we discussed what we’d like to record. Here’s where I may be crazy. I’m thinking we’d be lucky in that amount of time to get five songs done. These guys are insisting that we can “go in tight and crack through a bunch”.  They’re talking about each one of us having three original songs ready for the one 12 hour session.  I think they are nuts, and that we’d be crazy going in like that, and that studio time needs to be intentional and we need to be prepared to listen carefully to the engineer we’d be working with and to have plenty of time to get things right.

so I've been organizing gigs for my band for a while now (we are still very unknown but do our best to play as much as possible wherever we can) and twice now I've had venues postponing/canceling gigs because no reservations were made by people beforehand.

the first time that that happened wasn't actually bad - they hit us up and asked if we and the other bands could shift the date to a few months later and then we played that gig. easy.

now, however, the venue in question is further away in a town where we don't know anybody. what's even weirder is that the organizer wrote that they love having small bands from outside of town playing there because of the diversity etc etc - in my first email I also immediately made clear that we are a 90min drive away from them and don't have any connections to there. anyways, their quasi sound guy just wrote me and was like ""well if you dont bring x amount of people we're gonna cancel the gig, sorry""

is it just me or is that actually a bit weird/shitty?

In fact it sounded so good that I felt inspired. I didn’t just want to get through the gig. I was looking forward to every note and chord. 

It was so hard to believe that I turned off the reverb on my amp. It made no difference. I even turned off my amp and my classical guitar still sounded wonderful just with less volume.

I was asked by a couple of childhood friends to join their band. We had always dreamed of finally jamming together professionally and even better that this band had a record label supporting them. So I joined, hadn’t joined before when they first started since I had another project I was working on. Immediately after finally WORKING with my childhood friends did I start seeing their work ethic. One was too strung up on the drugs and focused on scoring daily while on tour with a wife back home and the other was so talented (ambitious?) that he was constantly trying out for bigger bands every chance he got behind our and the labels back. The whole band in general had a “we’re the best musicians in the state (for this specific genre) and we’re gonna blow up and do drugs and be better than everyone else” 

As soon as I joined I saw no professionalism from anybody, pure individualism. Me having plenty of experience working with team members and strategizing in a professional environment, I did the best I could to try to get everyone on the same page. The band imploded, too many extremes for everyone to get along and I was caught in the middle of everything. Eventually the label ditched everyone after many egotistical issues and confrontations between the members and kept me as admin for insider help with their next projects. To this day I keep very little contact with my childhood friends sadly.

We are a newly established band ourselves, so we took on this residency as a way of refining our live performance and getting a fanbase started. 

From the start, we weren't promised payment but we were promised a PWYC bucket to be passed around where the proceeds would go to us, as well a free drink and discounted food of the menu. 

The first few weeks we didn't pass a bucket because the crowds were too small.  We enjoyed our free beer in the meantime. We started making some money at other gigs so it wasn't important to us. 

We found out more recently the establishment is having some financial difficulties. For this reason, they have stopped the free drinks and discounted food for the artists because they were losing revenue. 

At our last gig, the audience was large and the place was hoppin. We saw the event manager passing around a PWYC bucket. My band and I were stoked to finally be making a little cash. 

HOWEVER, I learned that the bucket was actually for ""donations"" where the proceeds would be going back to the bar and NOT the artists. 

I know from experience and from other friends that artists are often taken advantage of and I'm getting really sick of it. I know it's hard in the city for businesses to succeed but it shouldn't be done on the backs of artists that aren't being fairly compensated.",1579806468.0

And I figured that the rules have changed so much in the last 7 years, that a young person (such as I am; 24 y/o) may actually have more of an insight to the inner working of leveraging digital in music than my esteemed predecessors. I realized that if you are serious about finding success in this crazy industry - *as a musician, manager, booking agent, publicist, business manager, promoter, etc* \- you MUST stay educated about the modern practices of successful artists. We must use these new technique to build our dreams (*which, for me is to tour professionally as a freelance bass player*). So, while I was touring in 2018 I wrote a book about it. Since then I recorded an audio-experience/version of the book, which I am releasing today! It contains 5+ hours of Music Industry information and is almost 1 year in the making.

These episodes are available on **Spotify** and **Apple Podcasts**, as well as 8 other platforms.

This audio series explores 4 concepts:

* ***Publicity***
* ***Marketing***
* ***Touring***
* ***Album Release***

It covers basic music industry topics like **Record Deals**, **Copyright**, **Royalties**, and the **Responsibilities of Industry Professionals**, as well as more advanced topics like:

* *Actually making money*
* *Attracting Press and Publicity*
* *Facebook and Snapchat Advertising*
* *High-Quality Digital Content*
* *Paying Taxes*
* *Attracting a Booking Agent*
* *Advanced Marketing*
* *Landing Pages & Fan Funnels*
* *Branding*
* *Modern day Touring*
* *Album Release Digital PR Campaign*
* and seriously so so so much more.

I wrote, produced, and narrated this audio series by myself, and I'm sure I went a little crazy doing it. I'm so happy to release the darn thing. I frequently browsed Reddit, searching through forums like this one to find music industry related questions. Hopefully, I have presented this information in a way that will help answer those questions, and many more.

This Audio-Series is dedicated to all the teachers in my life. May it inspire you as they have inspired me!

874,Earplugs During a Concert (Rant),35,aczcdp,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/aczcdp/earplugs_during_a_concert_rant/,34,"I'm sick of hearing how wearing earplugs is ""lame"" or ""not metal enough"" when attending a concert, especially when you are up close to the stage.

Where did this even come from?

As a musician, my ears would be ringing for days until I started plugging up, especially during practice. It has been an amazing help and I feel like I am nowhere near tinnitus.

Yet I talk to so many guys that just accept ringing and permanent damage like it's a ""badge of honor."" It could be one of the stupidest decisions of your life especially if you are exposed to loud music frequently.

I've gotten a bunch of people over the years to wear plugs and they thank me for it. Others just go ""meh"" I'll deal with it later and sometimes I can even tell they have experienced what might be permanent hearing loss.

Yeah, it sucks that sometimes you can't hear the full spectrum but if you by the right kind of musician's earplugs, it actually works well and takes away the pounding. Example this page talks about it: [Prevent Tinnitus at a Gig](https://concertear.com/ears-ringing-after-concert/)

Or, you should simply where the plugs for some songs and maybe take them out for others, but overall I feel like they are usually necessary unless you are way in the back.

So what's the reason people are so against earplugs in many cases? Does it come down to the fact that they simply need to hear everything no matter what? A lot of old heads regret not doing it, guys in their 50s+ that never plugged up. I hear tons of horror stories...",1546728993.0

876,Five Ways to Sabotage Your Own Band,35,8gs5tr,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/8gs5tr/five_ways_to_sabotage_your_own_band/,28,"**Five Ways to Sabotage Your Own Band**

*By. T. Perry Bowers* 

I have a little over twenty rehearsal spaces in my facility in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota. The average turnover on my monthlies is about one per month. Bands are required to give me thirty days notice when they want to move out of their space. Receiving that phone call is always interesting \- I’m concerned about the way people experience my business, so I’ll ask them why they are moving. *\(I really want to know if it had anything to do with me\).* Nine times out of ten the reason is internal difficulties within the band. Here are some of the reasons I hear – just a few of the many ways artists sabotage their own band.

**Drugs/Alcohol**

It’s a creative endeavor being in a band. Creative people like things that inspire them and make the creative juices flow. Drugs do this. Sure, it’s an easy way to get into the creative mood. Just take a drug and suddenly you want to be at practice. You want to write a song and spend five hours working on a riff. The problem is that drugs wear off. And when the drugs wear off, you are moody, sick and tired. 

I watch guys come to their practice spaces with a ton of beer. It’s one thing to have a six\-pack. It’s another to bring in a few cases. I have a couple of bands that fill the trash cans outside their room with beer bottles every time they practice. They practice for a couple of hours at a time. I’ve been outside their rooms across the hall for their entire practice. After about an hour, the quality of their rehearsal is significantly reduced. They play poorly. They take long breaks and talk about non\-music things. Then, they literally come out of their practice space stumbling. Those bands aren’t going anywhere. 

**Not Prioritizing Music**

My band Silverseed has been looking for a permanent bass player for most of the time we have been a band! Sometimes bands are like that. One position just isn’t solid. I’ve come to terms with it and I am grateful for the members that are committed. Eventually we’ll find the right bass player, but for now, we get to experience a new guy every few shows. It’s interesting; the excuses people give to not show up to practice. At first glance, they seem legitimate. Their kids, wives, or parents spring something on them and they feel obligated. “Emergencies” like “my insurance adjuster needs to come and look at my roof today” happen. Or, “I need to get my oil changed”. Yeah, I’ve heard that one, too. It’s almost as bad as the classic, “I need to wash my hair!”

The point is that if music isn’t top of your list, then you’re going to have a difficult time making progress. Girlfriends will constantly pull you in different directions. Your kid’s baseball games will sometimes be scheduled during band practice. Your friend’s birthday party will interfere too. But, if you make music a priority and the people in your life who are important to you know that your music time is off limits, you won’t have to constantly negotiate. Your loved ones will know not to mess with your band stuff. It might seem juvenile coming from a forty\-five year old man who still has a rock band, but it’s what makes me happy. And, for other parts of my life to be good, I need my musical life to thrive. If I can’t make music on the regular, you might as well put me in the ground because life just isn’t worth living without rock and roll, right?

**Self\-Doubt**

You need a certain degree of confidence when it comes to making music. But there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Confidence is speaking up when you know something isn’t right. When it comes to song\-writing I know how the song needs to go, but I didn’t always have the courage to tell my band mates how I wanted them to play it. I know what turns the audience off, but self\-doubt sometimes stopped me speaking to band mates to tell them to stop doing certain things on\-stage. However I’m over most of that now. I will usually speak my mind. That comes from self\-confidence gained over the years. However you have to be tactful when presenting your idea \- which leads me to the next way to sabotage your band:

**Not Having Finesse**

I’ve lost band mates over the years by being too blunt! Often, I regret the things I say. I’ve spent many months searching for drummers and bass players because I lost band members due to something I said. Sometimes things do need to be said, but if possible, take a breath before you do something inflammatory. Being in a band requires perspective. Think of all the bands that are no longer together because of petty disagreements. Before saying or doing something rash, take a moment \(or a week\) to appreciate what you have. It’s a rare thing to have four or five guys playing in a band together and getting on. Don’t take it for granted. When you do need to confront an issue, use finesse. 

**Not Having Direction**

There are a lot of ambitious bands out there. Some spend hours on social media promoting themselves every day. There are songwriters who wake up before you to go into the studio to craft a hit song. No matter how hard you think you work, there are people in New York and Los Angeles that would put your work ethic to shame. On the other hand, there are the bands who think all they have to do is look good and play a show once in a while and everything will be handed to them. Don’t be that band. Take control of your career from the beginning. Decide where you want to be and how you’re going to get there. 

Be creative with your songwriting and with your business. Look for new ways to get your name out there and bring in revenue. Keep thinking about how to get your band in front of new people and capture their contact info while you’re in front of them. Be smart, be creative and be relentless.  And don’t sabotage your own band!

The gigs are regular, and the pay is decent.  The best part is I don't have to do anything - the band leader books all the gigs, does all the marketing, and even sets up and tears down the bulk of the gear - I only have to worry about my guitar and amp.

Given all that the band leader does, I don't expect to be paid an equal share of the profits, I see myself as more of an employee.  I don't care that he pockets all the money for merch, and I don't even care if what he's paying me is less than an equal cut of the gig proceeds.

But the tip jar somehow feels different, like he should be giving us an equal split of that money.  I know he probably has costs like web hosting and other marketing materials that the tip jar probably helps cover, but it feels like the whole band earns those tips based on our performance and engagement with people on and off stage.

It's going to be released soon, like a couple weeks.  This member did some things that made the band kick them out.  The ousted member demanded that their part be taken out of the finished recordings.  Are we obliged to do this? I want to get the part removed to be over and done with it, but it's going to severely effect the quality of this release. Does anyone know the legality or have advice on this?

UPDATE: I decided to try and remove the parts.  I don't feel obliged, since the former member was being extremely petty, but I think their pettiness will continue in other ways.  I just want to be done with them.
 I explained the situation to the studio who did the mixing and they'll fix it for free today (very nice of them). Luckily it's easy to remove and wasn't integral to the songs, just soundscapes. The studio is going to talk to the mastering company on our behalf to see if we can get a similar deal with them.  
This may delay the digital release but we'll do some physical copies so we have something to provide for our release show that we've already been planning for many months. 


Update 2: I was able to get to studio to remove the part and remix the songs, and the remastering was also done.  It looks like we'll make our timberline for our release! On a crappier note, the former member is harassing abs threatening us.  Had to buy home security :(.

883,I and many others have had unreleased songs stolen by a guy under the name Flash Sendric.,37,168gt1i,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/168gt1i/i_and_many_others_have_had_unreleased_songs/,30,"I wanted to spread the word and hopefully get in touch with people who have also been negatively impacted by Flash Sendric.

I've been enveloped in this nightmare involving an individual by the name of Flash Sendric combing through innocent music feedback Discord servers (and likely other places) and stealing unreleased/unfinished work from unsuspecting up-and-coming musicians, including myself. I've been in touch with a few others who have also fallen victim to Flash Sendric's schemes. What was once a fun way to communicate with other musicians turned into a seemingly irreversible mess that I'm struggling to clean up. The damage this guy has done to me and many others has been devastating. I can barely eat or sleep, I feel so violated and humiliated that this person swiped something I poured my heart and soul into without my consent and is making money off of me. I've been filing copyright claims and sending emails left and right, but have yet to see the work he stole from me and others taken down.

It's tricky because this person takes things and releases them before you do, under your nose. I do feel very bad for having shared my unreleased music to anyone, that is where I admittedly went wrong - the Internet is the Wild West and I've learned my lesson - but that doesn't make this person's actions justifiable, and they need to be held accountable and stopped.

This all appears to be financially driven behavior. What I've learned is that Flash Sendric will steal unreleased music and put it through different distribution services. Because they are unreleased works, they slip under the radar and are released under every platform. To get views, he adds other popular artists in the credits which places the songs in the public eye. Flash Sendric has made a pretty penny off me this way...

If anyone has any information on this person please don't hesitate to comment. I'm not afraid to take legal action if it comes down to it and every voice affected by this person needs to be heard for the sake of all artists.

Thank you.",1693696025.0

However, he's the youngest in our group and lately I feel like his lack of maturity has really been showing. On Saturday we were playing a tailgate and we started playing at 1 pm. At 12:30, we had no idea where he was. His phone was going to straight to voicemail, and according to his friends, they had last seen him absolutley shit faced at 5 am. Thankfully he showed up in time, but for a hot second we were seriously considering cancelling the show as we were all standing on stage and we were set up. We don't have any written expectations as far as call time before a show, but we all agreed that he was in the wrong. Additionally, we have regular Sunday rehearsals,  2 of the past 3 Sundays he has not shown. The most previous one he straight up didn't tell us until 30 minutes after it stared that he was in another city. 2 weeks prior he called 30 minutes before rehearsal ended that he had just woken up, and was very hungover. 

I feel like this needs to be addressed but since we don't have a clear band contract I'm not sure how to broach this. I also feel like most of my bandmates agree with me, but I don't want to go explicitly behind his back to address this with them. What do I do going forward?",1668524726.0

My band plays like 90’s-2000s esque alt rock music (think Smashing Pumpkins, very early Coldplay, Oasis). Our drummer is great and super talented, but the only issue I have is he overplays every song. He can’t go more than two measures without putting some crazy fill in. They don’t serve the songs and with me playing bass and writing the songs he ends up changing grooves and putting in these crazy new fills in every time we practice and it’s become very hard to predict what he’s going to do to try and time hits with him because he’s constantly changing the grooves and again throwing fills in random parts of the song. I feel like his playing isn’t serving the songs and he’s over compensating for not practicing by trying to show off the whole song. 

Sorry that was a bit of a rant. I just want to find a way to tell him that him throwing fills in everywhere and changing up his playing every time we practice isn’t serving the music, I just don’t want to hurt his feelings or come off the wrong way because he really is a great drummer and I know he can play the songs. 

I guess my question is if someone in your band were to say this to you how would you want to hear it? Again I don’t want to hurt his feelings or come off like I don’t appreciate his playing or think he’s not a good drummer. I just need him to play more consistently and in a way that serves the songs like everyone else is.",1660781100.0

I'm a 28 year old male and I've played left-handed guitar since I was 12. Last year I was diagnosed with cancer in the form of a sarcoma on my right riffing hand. 

The cancer made it clear that they need to cut off, my pinky finger, ring finger and initially the middle finger but that was saved. What remains is my thumb, pointer and middle.

This gutted me but I've come to terms. I was literally about to get on my first album, and also had another opportunity with an eagles tribute band to tour a couple countries for the first time. But this sarcoma ruined all that, and my dream.

However I'm a fighter and decided I may try to re-learn guitar right handed. My question is; since I've played for years left handed, will learning right handed come easier? Or do I need to put in the years all over again?

So, to start out with: I’ve been playing guitar, gigging, and writing songs since I was 10 years old. I later learned drums, keyboards, and bass.  I’m 19 now. I’m a massive fan of alternative/indie rock, folk rock, and psychedelic rock. My favorite bands are Wilco, The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Big Star, The Beach Boys, The Doors, Pavement, Elliott Smith, etc. 
 I live in Dadeville, AL, which is a small town in basically the middle of nowhere. The closest town is Auburn, AL, and we all know what that’s known for (War Eagle)! 
 I play open mics sometimes over at venues over there, and the audience somewhat accepts me. 
The main scene around here is country and pop. I don’t want to play what I don’t want to play. Plus, I sound horrible when I attempt country or pop. I have Asperger syndrome, and a bit of an eccentric/socially awkward personality. I’m kind of on the hippie/a little flamboyant edge in the way I dress on stage, though I often dress like your stereotypical college history or art professor when I’m not on stage. 
My voice is also not what would be considered a “great singer.” I can’t sing very loud unless I scream, and I sound like a combination of Neil Young, Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, John Lennon, and possibly even Daniel Johnston. I have a very nasal and “whiny” voice with a weird rounded/deep undertone due to my baritone/tenor range. 
I have a small cult following, and some of my heroes have heard my songs before and showed appreciation for them. However, no one wants to book me, and I have only a few monthly listeners on Spotify. 
What should I do to start getting out there and gigging again? I haven’t had a paid gig in two years because I went into reclusion for a while due to a decline in my mental state and I started at a community college. 
The next paid gig I have is on April 13 with my friend, who I have a duo project with. We get along great and have very similar music taste. Should I try to start gigging in a bigger city (which is farther away for sure) where I might have a more diverse audience? 
Peace out,
Ryan ",1711254334.0

I'm 30. I have light musical experience; been playing a decade +, vocals and guitar, but only jammed with friends in college (for girls, lol), or did open mics solo, or now mostly drop in with my GF's family and friends or at bluegrass festivals and drop in with strangers occasionally (GF's family plays a LOT of this stuff, fun, but not my scene to play).

I'm at a weird phase in my life.. I'm a doctor, and I make enough money in 3 months to cover my yearly bills (I'm very frugal; Live and travel out of my RV), and I don't have to work more than that if I don't want, although the jobs are all over the country, so I'm on the road when I am working (US). But I'm not satisfied with it.

I'm thinking the optional-at-least 6 months of downtime I have per year is a good place to restart that passion. And I'm kinda in a place where I can do it not for girls or for money... But just for me. Which feels good for me.

I'm wondering where I get started and talking this more seriously. I don't even need it to be profitable. Just have fun with it. Polish myself enough that I'm comfortable playing some local bars or any that I travel to when I'm on contract, etc. Either solo or with band.

Posting this on a throwaway because my real bandmates follow my account and I just need to vent about it for a minute. Also, this is a pretty long fucking thread so If you really care about what I have to say, please do so. And also If this isn’t allowed, I will gladly delete.

in 2020, I started a solo garage punk project during quarantine. In 2021 I was able to turn that solo project into a three piece band with my friends from high school. We’ve been going for about 8 months now and we’ve become pretty well known and respected in our scene and have played shows with some very amazing people. We put out an EP and an album and have another album on the way that was all home recorded by me. But within those 8 short months, playing with these guys has started to take a toll on me emotionally and mentally and has made me want to quit music and playing shows altogether because they are real douchebags.

My main problem is the drummer. At first, I thought he was really cool because he’s a good drummer and he’s the only drummer in town that I know of. But recently, he’s started to have a really bad ego problem after we won a local battle of the bands. His oversized ego has led him to back out of any show that aren’t paying over $300 and he flat out refuses to play shows friends of ours are putting on because he wants us to “make it” and “be famous” and often complains when I don’t wanna put up with his bullshit. Because of this, we’re slowly becoming disliked in the scene and seen as flakers by a few venue owners. To give you an example, we’ve been forced to back out of 8 different shows because of our drummer.

He also has a tendency to not take responsibility when he damages his kit and instead chooses to put the blame on me because he leaves his kit at my house for practice. Few Examples: blaming a broken hi hat on me when he dropped them during load up after a show, blaming me for his snare head ring coming loose after he was careless during another show (it was a shitty remo head). He often tells his lies to other musicians in our scene which makes me look like a dumb careless singer and I have gotten some shit for it.

Our bassist isn’t a huge problem, I get along with him better than our drummer, but that doesn’t mean he has his problems either. The main problem is that he has a tendency to be extremely rude to other musicians and bands from our scene. Often disrespecting other bands for no real reason. He also has an ego problem like our drummer and thinks he’s a better bass player than anybody else in the scene. But my major problem that I’ve had to constantly check him for is his tendency to make really insensitive and very unfunny “jokes” about other musicians. The worst was when he made “jokes” about killing members of other bands he didn’t like.

One thing they both collectively share, is that they only care about making money with the band, the only questions that seem to ask me at shows is how much the venues gonna pay us or how much we’re getting in donations and get really mad when we make less than $100. Me personally, I don’t give a shit about money because all I care about is playing shows for people who like my bands music and with bands that I really love and respect.

Another thing is that they’re extremely ungrateful to people who try and help us out. The prize for the battle of the bands contest that we won is a free studio session at a well respected recording studio (which would cost $2,000). I was pretty excited but the band wasn’t, they were mad that they didn’t win money or anything like that. Example 2: a musician I’ve been good friends with for years wants to get us a set of speakers, subwoofers, and stage monitors because I intend to start hosting DIY shows for local bands and artists. Instead, they were mad that they weren’t getting new guitars, Amps and drum kits. Instead, they told me that I should just sell the equipment so I can buy them new gear.

One more rant is about how they always complain to me about how our new songs should sound but they never take the time write their own riffs, drum parts, and lyrics, and whatever material they do give me, it’s stolen from other bands. Yes you heard that right, even though I have a band with me who claim to be very creative people, They instead leave me to do all of the writing for them while they just sit on their asses all day. I’ve tried telling them off a few times but it always results in them blaming me for not being communicative (our drummer doesn’t have a working phone number, a Facebook, and his only contact is instagram which he barely uses). 

I’m just really fucking frustrated with these absolute douchebags because when I started this band, I just wanted to have fun with my friends and play shows with fellow bands that I love and respect from my scene and slowly overtime build up our reputation and begin a tour within the surrounding states, but because of them and their constant monetary demands, they want a tour starting within January of next year despite both of them still being in high school, neither of us having licenses, and not even having a vehicle to transport us in.

Again, I’m sorry if this is really long, I just need to vent my frustrations to any musicians who understand my pain. If you have any advice on what to do, please tell me, if you want to critique me go right ahead, because I know I’m not a perfect bastard either.",1659783461.0

I'm a mixing engineer based in Liverpool. I've put together a quick guide to help artists record high-quality tracks at home. It's primarily written for artists without much audio engineering expertise (so I've tried to keep it as practical as possible!). Hopefully it helps you get the sound you're looking for.

I see how it can be an equal opportunity..I also see how people could take advantage because it’s free.  I feel like I’m giving and not receiving. It feels great to be a part of good music but if that’s all I get in return while these artists enjoy extra benefits then I think it’s somewhat unfair.

I was already a fan of the music and the leader/writer, lets call him Jim, was a friend of my parent and I had known him a while. They needed a keyboardist and I was eager to join so I asked, he said he wasn't sure as I'm in college and might be unreliable but I assured him it's no issue.

a few months in, we're gigging a bit and getting some attention. Jim has 'been in the industry' a long time and already had a lot of connections to labels, promoters, etc, or that's at least what he claimed. I started to notice that as I knew him better he was pretty arrogant and would be constantly name dropping, clearly trying to make me impressed or starstruck. he would also talk about all his label connections yet never offer to forward me an email, pass on one of my CDs (I make my own music) or anything and I really felt like he was only mentioning this stuff to maintain some influence. he also got comfortable mansplaining basically every part of the music making process to me, explaining my own synthesisers, explaining why he's a better sound engineer than the guy I'm paying to master my album. he would put down most music I said I liked or tried to share, he would bitch about all the other musicians in our town (it's not a big place). he just got on my nerves and I was thinking of quitting.

I guess they must've sensed this after we played a festival and although I was there with them the whole day we performed, did everything I should've, wasn't rude etc, I went off and did my own things seeing the bands I was into on the other days. after the festival I got a text asking if I was 'in the band 100%' because I didn't hang out with them, but honestly Jim never felt like a genuine friend not even due to the age gap but because he gave off such egotistical vibes. so I sad yeah, sadly I don't think it's working but I was grateful for the experience and wish them luck blah blah blah.

now I've heard through mutual friend of mine and Jims that he's been bitching about me to other musicians in town, saying I 'flaked' and I'm 'not ready to commit to music' which is not true, as I've almost finished my exams and I'm still gigging consistently and focussed on music as well as another band I've joined. I was also acquainted with a local label through Jim, and I've been talking to them about releasing my stuff with them but since Jim's band has signed to them they've just stopped being interested so I'm assuming he's said something. I was also acquainted with a popular radio DJ (in person) who said I should get in contact with but now Jims withholding his email address so I can't.

it just felt totally unfair that he was trying to inconvenience my music career and slander me to every music-related connection in the area. but now I'm guessing the reason is that I said I was committed and then left the band after about 10 months. should I phone him up and reassure him its not because of college, because I'm flakey, because I have better things to do, but because he's insufferable???

I’ve seen two major categories and everything in between - it’s newbies and guys with some experience in the past. Neither of both categories are capable of showing any promising results. It’s a bummer that I usually can't even see musicians playing their instruments or having at least something to listen. And usually if there is, this is 100% mediocrity due to lack of skill or taste.

I just can’t find people to make music with. I want to believe in people especially if they’re lack of skill, but I just can’t deal with this always at ease behaviour, absence of effort and casual ""looking for jams"".

One of the reasons why I keep looking and still not doing everything myself - I just need help. I’m not saying that I’m very talented or anything, but when it comes to music I’m doing, it’s a real struggle for one person. I actually kind of doing everything myself right now, but to get equally good at all the instruments, songwriting and sound takes a lot of time and I’m feeling overwhelmed and even burned out fair amount of that time.

I've been playing guitar ever since I got my first guitar when I was about 7 y/o and started singing when I was about 12 y/o. Music for me has always been a way to cope with a lot of shit I experienced, and like many other musicians it's my way to express myself.

But music to me was always just a way to cope and express, and I never really liked hearing myself play because I always lacked confidence. I did perform a lot these past years; but that's more because other people told me they really liked my music and wanted me to play, so I told myself to get over my anxieties and just play, still not enjoying my own music.

But the weirdest thing happened today. I was rehearsing for a gig I have tomorrow, and while I was playing I got goosebumps all over my body and I almost got a bit emotional (in a good way) by the music I was playing. I never experienced this before. I did recognise a kind of 'getting emotional' I used to have, but that never was a good feeling. That always felt more like embarrassment and wanting to disappear rather than getting goosebumps from joy.

Past 1,5 year I did work a lot on mental health issues I used to have, and maybe this is just step closer to getting some healthy confidence. 
But I was so surprised by this feeling and I want to know if other people ever experienced something like that, and if making music (or expressing in another way) changed after that. 

I hope I don't sound like I'm looking for attention, because that's not my goal at all. I'm just really curious and a bit overwhelmed.

I have also rarely played for other people, the very few times I did waaay back in my teens, I regretted sorely cuz all I heard was how nobody knew the songs I knew how to play, they were too slow/too boring/too downbeat, too whatever, people fidgeting two stanzas down the line, awkward curtesy at the end, an unpleasant situation for both parts. Fair enough, nobody has to like the same things as me, I'll keep my music to myself, we're all good. With the years I ended up with a very solid repertoire on my lap (I have easily lost sight of 2h+ just singing and playing, I really enjoy doing it) but that was just it: me and the guitar and silence in the room. 

A month or so ago, there's this couple I'm friends with, they're moving to the city to start gradschool, the two of them crash on my couch while they spend 4 long days looking for apts to rent and getting the feel for the districts, and so on. I was very pleased to have them here and help out with tips and tricks, they're both a pleasure to be around. On their last day I find out one of them used to be in a band, so I say there's a guitar in my room if they feel like playing something to kill the last few minutes before they go catch their train. Sure, why not!, the conversation gears towards cool indie bands and shitty venues to play at in their city. Then the unavoidable question comes: do you play the guitar too? I'm feeling comfortable around those two people, end up disclosing that I do, and so we pass the guitar back and forth playing cool pieces to each other, barely knowing the other's songs so no singing along but whatever, music is music. Then we stop, they have to go or they'll miss the train. Thanks a lot, when we come back here and settle down in our new apartment, you have to come over for us to play together some other time, this was really cool.

It was really cool, really exciting and fun, I would love to do that again. But something happened that night and it's been bugging me ever since, to the extent that I came all the way to write this post: I simply don't feel like I did half justice to my skills on that night, as compared to when I'm alone. Weak fingers, fumbling fingerpicking, shaky and low voice, hurried past some songs, didn't take the time for the outro, weird stuff like that that, again, pays no justice to the extent of my abilities. It was bitterly frustrating in a way, and I want to do something about it, because to me it feels like a crying shame that I can't honour (almost like?) this thing that sustained me for so long is just badly presented. Been really bugged and bewildered lately. 

Anyone out there willing to empathise with this random stranger and offer their two cents of wisdom? Would appreciate a lot. Have a nice day if you reached this line ;-)",1580927350.0
994,A Comprehensive Guide to Booking Your Own Tour (DIY Touring),30,ev88my,musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/ev88my/a_comprehensive_guide_to_booking_your_own_tour/,8,">**Erwin Schemankewitz**, owner of **Ever Upward Entertainment** Agency in Denver, CO has contributed to this article.

# How to Book Your Show: Hold, Challenge, and Confirm

When asking a venue promoter about booking a show, the conversation goes like this:

### Hold

A “**Hold**” is a verbal confirmation that the band would like to perform on an available date. The venue promoter will distribute holds on a first-come-first-serve basis.

If an agent wants to book a date at a venue to perform, the agent emails the promoter and asks for a hold on an available date. If another Agent for another band wants the date, that agent asks for a “2nd Hold”, or a “3rd Hold”, and so on. This process continues until an artist or agent decides to confirm their Hold or is challenged by someone else for the show.

It is not uncommon for a perfect weekend run of 2nd or 3rd holds to be ruined by an early challenger. For this reason, agents often have several holds in different markets or venues to safeguard their existing routing and to make sure the band can hit crucial markets. Sometimes the booking agent will even ask to hold multiple dates at the same venue. This happens when a band knows they want to play in a certain market (lets say, Atlanta), but they are not sure which date will work better for their routing or turnout.

When a booking agent is ready to confirm a show, the Agent will confirm/challenge a ***run*** (*shows in succession*) of holds at once with the promoters.

### Challenge

“Challenge” is the process of forcing the other holds on a date to confirm or back out within 24 or 48 hours of the challenge being issued.

For example: A booking agent with a 2nd Hold may Challenge an agent with a 1st hold for a date at a venue if they are ready to commit to a contract. Upon being issued a Challenge, the promoter of the show will give the agent with a 1st hold a 48 hour window of committing to the show or backing out.

If you have a 5th hold on the venues and you issue a challenge on the other holds, the promoter emails the other 4 holds and says “Your hold has been challenged, do you want to confirm?”

### Confirm

A “Confirm” is the verbal agreement that you intend to sign a performance contract and commit to a performance date and deal with a venue promoter.

## What happens if you back out of a Confirm?

Legally & financially, nothing happens. You have not signed a Performance Contract that would obligate the artist and promoter to certain terms if the show doesn’t happen. However, I highly advise to never back out of a confirm outside of an **Act of God** (known legally as a “***force majeure***”). The confirm is only a courtesy in legal terms, but it has a social weight — an obligation that you intend to sign a contract and bring legal and financial consequences to the performance.

The music industry is a small world, which means that word travels fast, especially among Promoters. So while you technically have not invoked the ***cancellation clause*** of a performance contract, that promoter might hold a grudge against you behind closed doors. A promoter will not go out of their way to bash the reputation of an artist that pulls out of a “confirm”, but as an agent you are putting yourself into a serious disadvantage when trying to perform in that market again.

Now, if the show is 4 months away and you pull out of a confirm because of some foreseeable event (wedding, birth of a child, double booking, etc), there is a reasonable amount of time for the promoter to find a new artist that night. But obviously, this is an inconvenience that everyone wants to avoid.

# Know Your Deals

### Guarantee

This is a Flat Fee that is guaranteed to the artist no matter the venue income (*tickets sold*) or expenses (*production, marketing, security*) related to the show.

### Door Deal

This is a % of the money made at the door via Ticket Sales. If you have an **80% Door Deal** and sell $150 worth of tickets, you will walk out with $120.

### Versus Deal

This is a Guarantee VS Door Deal, whichever one is higher in favor of the artist. This is in situations where the band want a guaranteed amount of money to cover expenses and secure their tour budget, but in the event that the ticket sales are high the band will make more money.

### Split Point Deal

Which is a deal where by the artist has a guarantee, but also has the opportunity to make more money based on venue expenses and ticket revenue. Lets say you are signing a Performance Contract for an **80% Split Point** Deal after $500. The first thing to do is to calculate the dollar amount of the Split Point itself.

**The Split Point** =(*Box Office Revenue*)-(*Expenses*)-(*Tax*)-(*Artist Guarantee*)

You sell 100 tickets at $10 each, so the Box Office revenue is $1,000. The venue expenses, including audio engineers, security for your show, marketing expenses and overhead, total $250. The sales tax on tickets sold is 5%, or $50.

**The Split Point** = (*$1,000*)-(*$250*)-(*$50*)-(*$500*) = **$200**

When you reach the Split Point, that is called “***Going into Points***”. Any overage past the Split point is then split per the previously negotiated Percentage. (which in this scenario, is 80%). You will be walking home with $160 from going into points plus your guarantee of $500 for a total of $660.

>The Versus Deal differs from the Split Point because in a **Split Point**, the Artist gets their guarantee AND some, while in a **Versus Deal** the Artist gets their guarantee OR some.

# How to Interact with the Promoter

### How often do you follow up with a Promoter if they don’t respond to your email?

*“For a cold lead, You can start reaching out to promoters as early as 6 months in advance of the show or hold requested. When sending cold emails, you should email a ton of venues all at once, like throwing darts at a dartboard. Most will be misses, but some will stick. And you can lock those in to build your route. Focus on regional batches. For Example, ask for holds during a 2 week period in Northern California/West Coast, and then the following 2 week period in Southern California/SouthWest.”*

*“After about a month of tricking emails and correspondence, you can send you follow ups to all the cold leads who did not respond (which will be most of them). Make sure before you follow up that you check the event calendars for these venues. Do your due diligence to make sure that date is publicly available on their end. Once you are in the 2-month time frame, you can begin sending follow ups once a week until a route is locked in.”*

*“90% of the time, promoters are appreciative that the booking agent is staying on top of the show with weekly follow up. They may have read you initial email, made a mental note of the show, but forgotten to write back. You never know if your emails are going into a spam folder or how busy the promoters are. Most likely, you will receive curt emails like “not available”, “no”, or “OK”, from promoters when trying to book a show. These people are very busy! But or the most part, a promoter will not be annoyed with follow ups about a show, as long as the show is publicly available, because that’s how the business works.” (Erwin Schemankewitz)*

## Keep your emails short and sweet

When emailing a promoter or venue, keep your emails short and sweet: Include pertinent information only!

[Hypothetical email looking to secure a Hold from a Promoter](https://i.imgur.com/ZjQHf6X.png)

They don’t need your bio, or a persuasive argument about why your band should receive priority on the show. Do not send any attachments on the email. Instead, format the body of the email with hyperlinks, such as to the bands website, social media, or a spreadsheet of their history in that market. Lastly, do not inflate you numbers! If you can only draw 50 people, that’s fine. There is room for you in the market to grow and promoters understand this. The deal structure will reflect those numbers, of course. But at the end of the day, the market decides. And if you tell the promoter you can bring 200 people and sell 40 tickets… you won’t be invited back.

## Make a “Market History Report”:

A ***Market History Report*** is an organized account of your touring history. Usually in the form of an excel spreadsheet or Google Sheet, a Market History Report should be searchable, organized, and regularly updated. The Best MHR will include:

* Show Date & Venue
* How much money you made
* Region, City
* Performance Fee
* Ticket Sales (#)
* Ticket Price ($)
* Scale of 1–5 on Quality of the Performance/Crowd (*subjective measurement*)

# How to Classify Markets:

In the Live Concert & Touring industry, markets (*cities*) are classified into three sizes: **Tertiary Markets** (*smallest*), **Secondary Markets** (*middle*), and **Primary Markets** (*largest*).

### Tertiary Markets

**Tertiary Market**: the smallest of the three classification of market size. This is a small city or town, somewhere with a population of less than 50,000 people. Doing well in these markets can be attributed to a limited nightlife and music scene. Or its the hometown of one of your band members and you pack the club out with your local friends. These markets typically do not have theaters, but small clubs or large bars. This market sells 50–1,000 tickets.

[Tybee Island, GA](https://i.imgur.com/AM8wYPu.png)

### Secondary Markets

**Secondary Markets**: The middle classification of market size. The majority of your touring will be spent in Secondary markets. These are small — large cities with populations between 50k and 1 million. These markets have large theaters, developed arts communities, and an active nightlife. This market sells 200–5,000 tickets.

[Asheville, NC](https://i.imgur.com/l9c4I3c.png)

### Primary Markets

**Primary Markets**: These are really big cities: LA, Atlanta, Dallas, New York City, Toronto, Seattle, Nashville, Boston, Chicago, etc. Success in Primary markets is crucial to a booking agent because these markets are the most scalable. An artist can grow from 500 tickets sold to 50,000 in the same city. Routing a tour through Primary markets is easier and more lucrative for all parties involved.

# The Deal is The Deal

You can assume that the venue is lowballing on their first offer, but generally there is very little room for negotiation on a Performance Contract. Especially in the areas of hospitality, the venue will offer what they are capable of up front. In the case of a larger food buyout or a paid-for hotel room, this isn’t something that can be leveraged against the promoter. If the venue has a runner, they will be upfront about it. If the venue has a loft for the band to sleep in, they will be upfront about it.

For negotiating the Artist’s Performance Fee, the market will decide. If you can sell 50 tickets vs 500, your payment will accurately reflect that. Some venues have successful weekday show series, like a Monday Funk Night that will generate more revenue than normal. However you should consider Sunday through Tuesday to be off days or bad deals. For example, a door deal at a bar in an unfamiliar market might not even be worth the trip out there, unless it routes you to a better market later in the week.




### Pay Attention to the Radius Clause

A[ *Radius Clause*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_clause) is a time frame or geographic restriction that prevents an artist from playing a competing show. Standard radius Clause is 60 Days and 60 Miles and can be found in the performance Contract. It gives the promoter a form of territorial exclusivity over the performance. If get caught breaking a radius clause, that is legal justification for the promoter to remove you from the show. Radius Clauses are almost always found in contracts for soft-ticket events, so an event where you are not the main attraction such as a music festival. Make sure you or your manager is reviewing every performance contracts just in case. Failing to uphold your Radius Clause looks really bad on the artist and the management.

### Consider the Underplay

It is easy to get caught up in the numbers game. And that’s because the most important component of social marketing is non-quantifiable. You can’t turn it into numbers. You can’t measure it, you can only measure the results. That thing, is HYPE. An[ *Underplay*](https://www.denverpost.com/2009/01/01/underplay-bookings-guarantee-full-houses/), is a show that is guaranteed to sell-out because the venue capacity is so much smaller than the expected attendance.

While this strategy might not work for you financially, a close-to-home and stripped down version of your set can be great for building a community.

### Pay Attention to Local Support

Paying attention to which local band is going to support your headlining bill is a hidden gem that many club level bands completely ignore. You can essentially co-opt the entire fanbase of a well picked local support act. This is not only a good strategy for long-term market growth, but is also a healthy tit-for-tat in the concert industry. You provide an event just out of reach of the local act to do by themselves, and in turn they offer you the chance to impress their audience.

If you are a small local band looking to be booked onto a larger show this way, you need to starve your home market and build as much hype as you can. I know that this sounds paradoxical, but it’s simple Supply and Demand. The goal here is to create as much demand as possible (*creating and distributing high quality content, gathering press*) while limiting the opportunity for people to pay to see you play at a venue. Doing this correctly will give you leverage over other bands that the Promoter may be considering.

If you are a Touring band, do some research into the scene as to what bands have hype in that city and reach out to them directly. Be prepared to sacrifice some of the financial security of the show in exchange for them pulling a large crowd. You can offer to split a % of the back end or even a % of the door. If you have a band in mind, reach out to the Promoter about what kind of deal can be offered.

### Leverage Social Media accounts as Digital Credibility

Social Media is the first place a promoter will look first to discover information about the band. You should have amazing socials, with high-quality content that lets the promoter know you are a responsible business, and that you have the capacity to promote the show well and make the Promoter some money.

A small, organic and engaged audience is more valuable than a large, non-engaging audience. The questions that the Promoter needs answered is: Will this band sell tickets? Show promotion is a risk, and aside from seeing you in concert, social media is the medium for measuring an Artist’s success. If a promoter can see that you have a devoted, organic, and engaged audience, you’re more likely to be placed on the bill.

Certainly on your Social Media you should have high quality examples of your music and of your live show. How you choose to build you digital community is up to you, but know that every promoter considering adding you to a show, whether its a soft-ticket festival or a headlining spot at a club, will investigate your social media as digital credibility to your market history.

# Know the Lingo

***Hard Ticket***: Is an event where the main attraction is a specific artist. People in attendance are only paying to see a specific artist(s). Example: Headlining or Support artist in a club or theater.

***Soft Ticket:*** An event where the event itself is the main attraction and ticket seller and the artists are apart of the event. Example: City Music and Arts Festival

***The Advance***: Confirming in advance the details surrounding your show with the venue or promoter. Most of the details about the show will be confirmed when the performance contract is signed, but it is courteous to reach out the venue a few days before your show to confirm any last minute details, such as back line availability, parking, and hospitality.

***Back line***\*\*:\*\* Musical gear, such as drum hardware, guitar amps, or a bass guitar cabinet, that is provided by the venue for the band. This is common on Festival sets, when there are multiple bands performing with tight changeovers. This is also common when touring internationally, as it is both expensive and very difficult to bring gear with you into other countries.

***Buy Out***\*\*:\*\* Is when, in lieu of providing a meal to the band, the venue will just pay a flat sum to the band to purchase food.

***Buy On:*** Is when a smaller artist pays to be the supporting act for a larger artist

***Hall Fee***\*\*:\*\* The hall fee is a percentage (*20–25%*) of the total merch sales taken by the venue in exchange for allowing merchandise to be sold. Generally, only larger rooms will ask for a Hall Fee, like Theaters or Outdoor Festivals. A Hall Fee may sometimes be negotiated out of a contract in exchange for a smaller Guarantee.

***Load In/Soundcheck:*** Load In is the time where the venue will be open and your band is expected to arrive. Soundcheck means the stage is built, all technical processes are ready, and all band and crew members are on site. The reason I bring this up is to pay special attention to your routing. If your band has a 6 hour drive to the venue, it’s unlikely you will make a 3pm soundcheck.

>As an audio engineer, I don’t mind line-checking a group 30 minutes before doors open. But I do mind showing up to the venue to work and waiting around for 3 hours for the band to show up because they have poor communication skills.

***Performance Contract***\*\*:\*\* When the show is confirmed, the band will be asked by the promoter to send and sign a performance contract that finalizes details about the show, such as details regarding settlement, set times, load in and load out times, the radius clause, and more.

***Rider***: This is a document attached to the performance contract that address the artist’s hospitality or technical needs. This document “*rides*” on top of the performance contract.

***Comp***: abbreviation of complimentary. Such as: “*Comped tickets*” or a “*meal comp*”.

***The Nut***: Expenses on the Venue side. This includes things like Production, Security, Taxes, Cleaning Staff, Marketing Expenses, Insurance, and other overhead costs.

***Deadwood***: Unsold Tickets

***Papering the House***: Is when a venue gives away tickets, or let’s people into the venue for free to put more bodies in the room.

## Don’t take anything personally

Whatever happens, and only as long as you have done your due diligence, problems with routing and getting shows probably has nothing to do with you. The Music Business is a whirlwind of chaos, email threads, lost communication, and alcoholism. Sometimes things that seemed perfect on paper don’t work out. Sometimes responsible people make mistakes. Sometimes the show gets double booked, or the headliner gets stuck in traffic. Bands are a business, and business should never be taken personally. You just have to roll with the punches.
